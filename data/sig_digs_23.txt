-0.6 wins
Two excellent analyses of the year-after effect of sacking an NFL head coach dropped Wednesday, one from FiveThirtyEight contributor Michael Lopez and the other from ESPN’s Brian Burke. As one hopes when looking at independent analyses tackling a similar problem, their findings were consistent. Each found that teams that sacked their coach tended to do worse the next season than similar teams that did not fire their coach; Lopez estimated that teams that fired their coach saw their wins drop by about 0.6 the next season, and Burke found that the effect seemed to last, with teams that held on to their coach performing about 6 percent better two years on than those that fired them. Anyway, moral of the story is: best of luck, Rams and Bills. [ESPN, StatsByLopez]

22 percent
A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Harvard School of Public Health interviewed 1,613 adult gun owners in 2015 and found that 22 percent of owners who had gotten their newest firearm within the previous two years obtained it without a background check. [Annals of Internal Medicine]

36 percent
Quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns made 567 passing attempts this season and suffered 66 sacks and 138 hits for their troubles. This means that on 36 percent of all passing plays, the QB ended up on the ground, the highest “QB abuse rate” in the NFL. [Unconventional Stats]

79 organs
Irish researchers are arguing that a continuous fold of tissue that supports the intestines should be classified as an organ: the mesentery. That would crank up the total number of organs in the body to 79 — by many counts. [Ars Technica]

10,100 workers
Macy’s will cut 10,100 jobs after a dismal holiday sales period; it had already announced plans to close 100 of its 730 stores. [The New York Times]

$175 billion
Total losses resulting from natural disasters in 2016, according to a German insurance company, with insurance companies on the hook for about $50 billion of that. [The Guardian]

2 members
After the death of Sister Frances Carr on Monday, there are only two members of the religious society known as the Shakers. The group — officially the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearance — preaches celibacy and stopped adopting orphans some time ago, hence its membership drought. [The Guardian]

-4 percent
College football game attendance is down 4 percent on average since 2009 at the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision schools. That’s eating into the lucrative business of college football. [Bloomberg]

19 states
It is now 2017, which means a bunch of people got government-mandated raises as 19 states and 21 local jurisdictions increased their minimum wage. Lots of people have all sorts of economics-informed ideas about what will happen now — as is their wont, economists disagree on the specifics — so it’s a great real-life experiment for that crowd. [FiveThirtyEight]

4,200 “gifts”
I have no idea if it’s a protest, or a celebration, or just a cannabis-induced moment of inspiration, but the DC Cannabis Coalition is giving out 4,200 free joints at Dupont Circle in Washington on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. It’s legal to give away but not to sell marijuana in Washington, hence the great price. Then 4 minutes and 20 seconds into the incoming president’s speech — you know, the weed number — the 4,200 recipients are encouraged to spark up. Things are changing in America, so it provides a brief moment of consistency when potheads pull weird attention-seeking stunts regardless of who’s in office, you know? [WUSA 9]

554 million tacos
Jack in the Box, a fast-food chain, sells a ridiculous number of tacos that — based on the testimonials of people interviewed by The Wall Street Journal — are somewhere between gross and immensely addictive. That’s about as many Big Macs as McDonalds says it moved in the U.S. in 2007. [The Wall Street Journal]

Welcome to 2017.

13 percent
Percentage of American private-sector workers who have a traditional pension, down from 38 percent in 1979. Now 401(k) plans are the common retirement strategy for Americans, and some of their early supporters regret it. [The Wall Street Journal]

35 percent
Probability that the New England Patriots will win the Super Bowl, the highest of any team in the playoffs. They’re followed by Kansas City (16 percent); Atlanta and Dallas (14 percent); and Pittsburgh, Seattle and Green Bay (5 percent). [FiveThirtyEight]

240 green traffic lights
Heaven is a place on earth: An Uber driver says he made it through 240 consecutive green lights in 27 minutes while driving from Harlem to the Lower East Side in New York City. [The Associated Press]

189,100
Number of multifamily rental units completed between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016 across 54 U.S. metropolitan areas. Of those units, 84 percent were luxury, which seems pretty ridiculous. If everything is luxury, is anything luxury? [The Wall Street Journal]

91,404,322 miles
Earth will be at its perihelion on Wednesday, the point in our orbit where we’re closest to the sun. We’ll be a mere 91,404,322 miles away from that cascading nuclear torrent that feeds Earth energy, roughly 3 million miles closer than we are at our farthest point in July. [EarthSky]

$400 million
HGTV — the channel that made the “buy a home, fix it up and then either resell it or live in it and make babies” hero’s journey a viable business model — is killing it, now the third-most-watched cable channel. One potential reason for this is the sheer volume of programming the network puts out. HGTV makes 900 hours of television for $400 million annually, which is a great deal; Netflix spent $500 million on 600 hours in 2016. [Bloomberg]

Significant Digits is off between Christmas and New Years, so we’ll see you on the other side. Keep an eye out for the data awards we’ll be doling out next week — we may send them your way to keep you company while SigDig is off. It’s been a delight having y’all as readers during this uneventful and boring year. 

16 cars
Uber, which decided to experiment with a faulty batch of 16 driverless cars on California roads where real-life people are, has moved the cars’ trial to Phoenix, Arizona. [The Guardian]

39.5 percent
Percentage of Americans aged 18 to 34 who live with their parents or another family member. The figure has been steadily rising since the fifties. [The Wall Street Journal]

41 cents
A Chicago man is suing several McDonald’s restaurants because the “Extra Value Meal” is 41 cents more expensive than if each item was separately purchased. The man says the lawsuit is “about principle.” Listen, everyone has to pick a hill to die on eventually. James Gertie has found his, and there’s nobility to that. [USA Today]

2,350 acres
Number of acres of farmland Kentucky devoted in 2016 to the cultivation of hemp, Marijuana’s close relative that has a myriad of industrial uses. That number is up from 922 in 2015. That’s almost a quarter of national production. [Bloomberg]

$1.5 million
A Canadian businessman saved more than 50 Syrian refugee families — more than 200 people — by putting up $1.5 million in funds and offering jobs to refugees who come to Canada. [Toronto Life]

€20 billion
The world’s oldest bank is the Italian Monte dei Paschi di Siena, but age does not breed stability: The Italian government has agreed to a €20 billion bailout of the bank, considered one of the weakest in Western Europe. [The Independent]

About 10
Number of times somebody tried to camp out and have a slumber party in an IKEA somewhere in the world this year, including two 14-year-olds in Sweden recently. The company is now on record asking teens and others to stop doing it, having never heard of the Streisand Effect evidently. Hear that kids? IKEA slumber parties are the new recreational drug use. [BBC]

22 percent
Percentage of Americans who have given to an online fundraising project. For some context: that’s higher than the number who have used a ride hailing app (15 percent) but lower than the number who have bought tickets from an online reseller (28 percent). [Pew Research Center]

455
Number of scripted television series that aired this year according to the research team at FX, up from 421 last year. If your pilot isn’t already in development, that’s on you. [TV By The Numbers]

2,606
Number of census tracts, plus a further 278 zip codes, where lead poisoning is at least twice as prevalent as it was in Flint, Michigan at the height of Flint’s lead crisis. There are likely more areas, but Reuters was only able to analyze records in 21 states. [Reuters]

$105,803
Cindy Stowell, a 41-year old from Texas, just finished a seven-episode win streak on “Jeopardy!” that aired through Wednesday. Over the course of the run — which was pre-taped in August — Stowell won $105,803 and had a good rapport with Trebek. Now we know that as she taped, Stowell had Stage IV colon cancer with a six-month prognosis, competed despite a blood infection to fulfill a life-long dream, kicked serious tail as far as Jeopardy win streaks go, was raising the money to donate to cancer-related groups and passed away on December 5. I’ll take “Reasons to cry on the subway” for $400, Alex. [SB Nation]

1.3 billion
Tesla has 1.3 billion miles of car-driving data thanks to its Autopilot-equipped vehicles that are already on the road before competitors in Detroit and Silicon Valley can roll self-driving cars off the lot. It’s a massive competitive advantage. [Bloomberg]

Jus so you have a little warning on this, Significant Digits is off between Christmas and New Years. After Friday’s edition, we’ll see you on the other side. Maybe we’ll send you some of the data awards I spent all week writing.

0.9 percent
A poll that checked in on the same group of voters throughout the election found that between October and Election Day 0.0 percent of respondents moved from Trump to Clinton, while 0.9 percent switched from Clinton to Trump. If there was indeed a comparable swing on a national level, that’s 1.2 million votes. [FiveThirtyEight]

17.9 points
Average points allowed from the New York Giants defense, a squad that has managed to stop their opponents’ short passes, which are the main way modern NFL offenses advance the ball. It’s why the team is a 97 percent chance to make the playoffs. Also, the Giants have given the Dallas Cowboys their only two losses of the season. The Giants have a precedent of denying the league’s top team an undefeated season, of course. [FiveThirtyEight]

$20
A bill filed by South Carolina state Rep. Bill Chumley would require all sellers of computers to install online pornography blocking technology or face a fine of $20 per computer sold, and South Carolinians would have to pay $20 to remove the blocker. This is gonna go over great with the constituents, I just know it. [The Charlotte Observer]

11 days
Saudi Arabia is adopting the Gregorian calendar. The state previously used the Islamic calendar, where it is 1438, not 2016. The shift from a lunar calendar to one based on the rotation of the earth means people have to work an “extra” 11 days per year. [The Economist]

728 clues
The New York Times’s iconic crossword puzzle tried something new this past weekend, with a 728-clue crossword puzzle in a special print section. [The Verge]

$5 million
A sham botnet operated by Russian criminals is skimming up to $5 million a day from a counterfeit advertising ring, where bots visit fake web pages with real advertisements to juice fake video hits that generate real money. [CNN]

3 electoral votes
Several members of Washington State’s presidential electors defected from Hillary Clinton during the Electoral College vote and instead supported for candidates who didn’t win the state. Three people voted for Gen. Colin Powell and one voted for Yankton Sioux elder Faith Spotted Eagle. The faithless electors may each owe a $1,000 fine. [Los Angeles Times]

78 pardons
President Obama pardoned 78 people, the largest single-day pardon of any president. He also commuted the sentences of 153 other inmates. [The Star]

81 percent
Percentage of non-Christians who celebrate the holiday of Christmas in the United States. About a third of Americans in total celebrate it more as a cultural holiday. [The Pew Research Center]

962 cases
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported 99 “complicated” black lung cases in the past five years, but that’s only the number that the government thought had occurred. The reality is much worse: NPR contacted 11 black lung clinics across coal country and found a total 962 cases since 2010. [NPR]

17,000 points
Harry Dent, who less than two weeks ago said the Dow could fall 17,000 points as a result of Donald Trump’s election win, is suddenly bullish on the market. A stunning reversal! [Business Insider]

13 billion euros
Both Ireland and Apple are now challenging a European Union decision forcing Ireland to recover 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from the company. The EU is arguing that there was a sweetheart deal between Ireland and Apple that allowed the company to significantly minimize its tax burden, while Apple is arguing the EU changed its policy retroactively.

14-48 record
The Jacksonville Jaguars fired head coach Gus Bradley after another loss on Sunday. He had the worst record among modern coaches who coached more than 50 games, going 14-48 in more than three seasons, or a .226 win percentage. [NFL.com]

41 percent
The number of Wells Fargo consumer checking accounts that were opened in November was down 41 percent compared to a year earlier. [Reuters]

47 percent
Daily fantasy sites like DraftKings are heavily stratified, with power users reaping huge chunks of the financial gains. [Extreme Bernie Sanders voice:] The top 1 percent of users accounted for 47 percent of winnings in the past six months. [The Wall Street Journal]

196,000 units
The NES Classic — a retro gaming system that lets players revisit classic Nintendo games — has sold well, moving 196,000 units from November 11 through the end of that month, according to a market research firm. It’s a bright spot for the industry even though spending on video game hardware is down. [TechCrunch]

$155 million
“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” pulled in $155 million at the domestic box office last weekend. [Variety]

555,808,292
A truly ridiculous amount of prescription opiates have been sent to West Virginia from 2007 to 2012: 555,808,292 doses of hydrocodone and 224,260,980 doses of oxycodone. That’s 433 pills for every person in the state over that time span. [Charleston Gazette-Mail]

6 drug companies
The attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing six drug companies — Teva, Mylan, Aurobindo Pharma, Citron Pharma, Heritage Pharmaceuticals and Mayne Pharma — of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. [The New York Times]

21 percent
Percentage of working members of the Animation Guild who are women. That’s not good, but it’s better than the Hollywood Reporter’s recent roundtable on gender and racial issues in animation — the seven-person roundtable was 100 percent male and 100 percent white. [Fusion]

33 counts
Dylann Roof was found guilty on Thursday on all 33 counts related to the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Roof was accused of killing nine black parishioners during a church bible study. [ABC News]

114,700 words
Length of the Wookieepedia entry on Anakin Skywalker — a.k.a. Darth Vader — before the Extended Universe was culled. That’s longer than the Wikipedia articles about Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt combined. Essentially, a decision was made in 2014 to designate a bunch of the Star Wars universe — the stuff that isn’t in the movies and some recent products — “Legends” rather than “canon.” This meant cutting that Vader encyclopedia article down to a mere 48,200 words, and it also made around 95 percent of the roughly 100,000 Wookieepedia articles canonically irrelevant. [FiveThirtyEight]

$9.5 billion
Total wealth of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet appointees so far (including cabinet-level positions). That’s more money than belongs to the 43 million least wealthy U.S. households combined. [Quartz]

10 percentage points
Only 41 percent of LGBT Americans rated their lives positively enough to fall into Gallup’s “thriving” category, according to a survey conducted Nov. 9 through Dec. 6. That’s down 10 percentage points compared to a Gallup survey conducted from Oct. 1 to Nov. 8 — you know, the period right before Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Pence won the White House. [Gallup]

30 percent
Share of Americans who rate Russia favorably, as of earlier this year. But public opinion about Russia tends to be way swingier than for other nations, so if the Trump administration takes a friendlier stance towards Russia, many Americans — particularly Republicans — might follow. [FiveThirtyEight]

61 years
Kokomo, Indiana, has overturned a 61-year-old law banning pinball in the town. I presume it’s been 61 years since that smooth-talkin’ out of town jasper tried to come ’round with a mighty fine smile and a tap in his step to remind the good parents of Kokomo that they’ve got trouble you see, trouble right here in Kokomo, trouble with a capital “t” and that rhymes with “p” and that stands for “pinball”! [The Kokomo Tribune]

93 percent
If the New York Giants beat the Detroit Lions this weekend, the Giants will have a 93 percent chance of making the playoffs, up from 75 percent right now, according to our Elo-based NFL predictions. If Detroit wins, their chances of making the playoffs jump from 84 percent to 98 percent. It’s the most important game of the weekend. [FiveThirtyEight]

8 million food processors
Conair, the parent company of Cuisinart, is recalling eight million food processors after 69 consumer reports of broken blade shards appearing in food. [USA Today]

1 billion hacked accounts
In addition to a 2014 hack that affected 500 million user accounts it kept under wraps, Yahoo revealed on Wednesday that a separate attack in 2013 involved more than 1 billion accounts. This somehow puts a good spin on the calamitous end to my Yahoo Fantasy Football season, as now I can blame some botnet in a former Soviet republic for playing Allen Robinson last week over Kyle Rudolph, leading to my 1-point loss.
