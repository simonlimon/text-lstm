1.5 percent
The King of Saudi Arabia vacationed in Morocco and the trip cost around $100 million. This is an immense figure, even in the context of a national economy: It’ll end up being around 1.5 of the entire 2017 foreign tourism revenue for the nation of Morocco. [The New York Post]

2 shipments
A confidential United Nations report reveals that two shipments from North Korea to the Syrian government agency responsible for that country’s chemical weapons program have been intercepted over the past six months by two U.N. member nations. [Reuters]

63 cents
Questionable — or even fake — polls are having real-world influence. A recent poll showing musician Kid Rock leading the U.S. Senate race in Michigan preceded a wave of bets against his prospective opponent, incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, on the betting site PredictIt: Stabenow’s share price tumbled from 78 cents to 63 cents before recovering to 70 cents at the end of the day. One problem: The poll came from a previously unknown polling firm and may have originated from PredictIt speculators. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of people who tuned in to watch “Game of Thrones” on Sunday, a slight slip from the previous week. The episode had leaked online earlier last week. [TV By The Numbers, @WaltHickey]

$50 million
Amount of money wagered on the 2015 fight in Nevada between boxers Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Somehow the upcoming bout between the still-undefeated Mayweather and boxing-newcomer Conor McGregor appears to be headed north of that, with a bookies estimating nearly $70 million will be wagered. Despite the inherent underdog quality of McGregor, people are still scrambling to bet on him, albeit in smaller quantities: At MGM Resorts, the average bet on McGregor is $112, versus $3,700 for Mayweather, with 6,000 transactions on McGregor to 200 for Mayweather.

9 percent
Rating are way up in 2017 for feel-good television network Hallmark Channel, with viewership up 9 percent so far this year. This doesn’t even factor in the huge Christmas bump for the cable channel, which in the holiday season punches up there among the likes of Fox News and ESPN. [The Washington Post]

11 songs
A Bloomberg analysis of the top 20 spots of the Billboard Hot 100 over the past three years found that the most popular brand name dropped was — somewhat unexpectedly — Rolls-Royce, which was mentioned in 11 songs. Eight of the top 12 brands are vehicles; the other four are Hennessy cognac, Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers, Rolex watches and Xanax. I really hope Xanax never makes a car. [Bloomberg]

17 percent
Your car may be losing value faster than in the past: On average, the value of a U.S. used car dropped 17 percent over the past 12 months. In 2014, that figure was 9.5 percent. There’s a glut of automobiles for sale, which drives prices down. On the other hand, this may explain why automakers pursue pop stars to move products. [Bloomberg]

“Total Eclipse of the Heart” saw a huge spike on Spotify yesterday in the United States, the same day a total solar eclipse swept the nation. Alternative theory: I seriously crushed the Bonnie Tyler song at karaoke last week, prompting a nationwide re-evaluation of the work. I’m just saying it’s worth investigating. [Quartz]

Today, a large portion of the United States will experience a solar eclipse! Here’s an all-eclipse version of Significant Digits. I’ll be co-anchoring ABC News’ digital coverage of the eclipse, watch it here.

1 hour, 33 minutes, 16.8 seconds
Duration of the eclipse on U.S. soil today from Oregon to South Carolina. A solid 70-mile-wide swath of the country coast-to-coast will get to experience a total solar eclipse for anywhere from a few seconds to over two minutes. It may be responsible for the largest mass migration to see a natural event in human history. [The Atlantic]

45 million pairs
Number of eclipse glasses — the approved way to view a solar eclipse without permanent retina damage — sold by American Paper Optics (one of the few authorized sellers of certified glasses) over the past two years. Do what you can to get your hands on a pair; it’s unsafe to attempt to stare directly at the sun. [ABC News]

1,651 miles per hour
Average speed of the eclipse as it sprints across the country. While the big event is going on, a considerable amount of research will be happening, as briefly blocking out the sun is a handy way of studying everything from earth’s ionosphere to how animals react to eclipse-induced midday temperature and light swings. [FiveThirtyEight]

75 million
Approximate number of people who live within a 200-mile drive of the path of totality across the country. About 12 million people live directly in the path of totality; experts estimate they could be joined by about 7.4 million people traveling to watch the eclipse. That could make for some serious traffic and clogged cellular networks. [FiveThirtyEight, Curbed]

29
Number of interstate highway routes that the total solar eclipse crosses. State and local officials are working to ensure that first responders and highway crews can react in a timely matter with or without access to cellular networks. [Time]

3.2 percent
Percent of energy generated in North Carolina from solar power in 2016. The nation is about to experience a slight dip in solar power generation, and the planning to react to the eclipse has underscored a number of issues regarding the state of infrastructure in the U.S. Regardless of how this time goes, by 2024 — the next time the U.S. is due for a solar eclipse — we’ll need to be ready.

Drop in the S&P 500 Thursday, the second largest one-day drop of the year for the index, and part of a broader slip in markets yesterday that was partially triggered by a rumor that the top economic advisor to the president and ex-Goldman Sachs exec Gary Cohn was resigning. That rumor was fueled by an inaccurate tweet from a breaking news Twitter account. Man, if that’s how markets handle Cohn not leaving the administration I’d hate to see how they’d handle it if he ever does. [Business Insider]

30 engineers
Creating a universally comfortable mattress takes a lot of brain power. Thirty engineers’ worth of brain power, to be exact. That’s how much thought and engineering goes into the research and design behind this mattress to ensure that you get your best night’s sleep. Sponsored by Casper

18 percent
India is seeing a huge media opportunity in an unlikely place: FM radio. Radio revenue in India increased 18 percent in 2016 to $416 million across 313 commercial FM radio stations and a state broadcaster. That revenue is small compared to the U.S. market, but the growth is explosive even compared to markets like Brazil and China (under 3 percent). Plus, the rights to 800 more stations are being auctioned off over the coming years. [The Wall Street Journal]

62 percent
Percentage of Americans in an August poll who considered North Korea a very serious threat, up from 48 percent in the same poll back in March. Meanwhile, a Marist University poll found only 19 percent of Americans have a great deal of confidence that President Donald Trump can lead the country through an international crisis. [FiveThirtyEight]

30,000 members
Number of members who left the American Civil Liberties Union over their legal defense of a neo-Nazi group in the late 1970s. The ACLU assiduously fights cases on first amendment law, and defending the rights of hate groups like the neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate and distribute fliers tend to be the provocative cases that skirt the edges of that kind of law. In light of the incidents in Charlottesville, Va. last weekend, the ACLU announced yesterday that it will no longer defend hate groups that attempt to incorporate firearms into their demonstrations. [The Wall Street Journal]

1.7 million
Number of elective plastic surgeries in the U.S. in 2016, of which more than 200,000 were nose jobs. The plastic surgery business is an interesting one with a fascinating gender gap: 75 percent of the people who got those rhinoplasties were women, but 85 percent of board certified plastic surgeons are men. [Racked]

7.5 million
Any discussion of jobs at risk of elimination tends to focus on the manufacturing sector, but it’s truly retail — the most common job in America — at the most profound risk. There are 7.5 million jobs in retail at high risk of computerization. Cashiers, who number 3.5 million, may be in the worst position of all. [The Guardian]

Number of orca deaths at SeaWorld parks this year, the latest resulting from the euthanization of a 42-year old female Kasatka at its San Diego park. SeaWorld is phasing out its orca performances by 2019. [Associated Press]

7 episodes
Number of episodes of “There’s… Johnny,” a sitcom about the backstage crew of “The Tonight Show” that was produced for streaming network Seeso as its tentpole comedy. Here’s the issue: Seeso was shuttered before the program could even go to air, raising a fundamentally modern question of what happens to shows that outlast their streaming start-up network.

Passer rating of Jags quarterback Blake Bortles during garbage time over the past two seasons, one point off Tom Brady’s overall quarterback rating last season. Granted, Bortles is only good during garbage time, that magical period in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter when a team is two or more scores back and Blake is throwing as if his job depends on it.

Number of NBA teams that will play four games in a five-night span this year, which is part of a league-wide scheduling plan to implement more rest days so that top talent can continue playing in those late-season must-watch games. On average, teams will play 14 back-to-backs compared to 16 last season. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 years, 5 months
Sentence for a man who accidentally discharged a gun while taking a selfie in “Club Lust,” a Florida strip club. [The Associated Press]

38.6 percent
Percentage of a 16 GB iPhone 6 that is aluminum and iron. The cocktail of other precious and base metals that go into the phones — 0.02 grams of bismuth here, another 0.014 grams of gold there, the little 0.01 grams of gallium to top it all off — have to come from somewhere, and the answer isn’t always pretty. [Motherboard]

38.9 percent
Former Chief Justice Roy Moore and Sen. Luther Strange will move on to the runoff stage of the special Alabama primary election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s seat in the the Senate. Moore — who was suspended from the bench for refusing to enforce the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage — won the first vote with 38.9 percent of the vote. Strange, who received 32.8 percent of the vote, was appointed to the seat by disgraced Alabama ex-Gov. Robert Bentley and has the support of President Trump. The winner of the GOP primary in Alabama is as close as one can get to a lock to win the general election, which will be held in December. [FiveThirtyEight, New York Times]

40 percent
The antique furniture market has taken a hard hit — with English antique furniture seeing a 40 percent drop in value over 10 years — in part because millennials don’t want to buy them. [Marketplace]

1.4 percent
Percentage of U.S. consumers with a FICO credit score that is a perfect 850. The number is hugely consequential when it comes to securing credit, and many aspire to that top figure and will use all the idiosyncrasies of the algorithm to get there. Indeed, the percentage of Americans with 800+ credit scores is steadily rising. [Bloomberg]

8 out of 7,287
Only eight of 7,287 music albums released between 2012 and 2016 got generally unfavorable (that is, bad) reviews on Metacritic. This means that either humans got really, really good at not making bad music; there’s a systemic disincentive for doling out bad reviews; or aggregating ratings is an incomplete portrait of the musical scene. [The Wall Street Journal]

11 points
Generally speaking when the president is at an approval rating of 38 percent we’d expect (historically) the president’s party to lose 11 points or so off its House margin of victory. If the midterms held today in the current congressional playing field, the GOP would lose the national House vote by 10 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

Average number of career receptions for the five wideouts remaining on the New York Jets. It’s really hard for a team to go 0-16 in the NFL, but let’s just say there’s a reason the Jets are in the conversation this year. [FiveThirtyEight]

21 percent
Percentage of shoppers at natural food supermarkets who didn’t know or had at best a rough notion of what “hormone/steroid free” means vis-a-vis buying meat. Still, those buzz words have pulled major chicken producers like Perdue towards investing in antibiotic free birds. [Bloomberg]

4.6 insurers
Average number of insurers in a sample of 20 states and D.C. that will participate in the Affordable Care Act marketplace in 2018, down from an average of 5.1 insurers in a given state in 2017. Trump administration threats to undermine the stability of the Affordable Care Act system have led insurers to increase premiums for 2018 — in many markets, by double digits — a nonpartisan study has found. [Kaiser Family Foundation, Associated Press]

28 times as likely
A study of English titles in the Google Books catalog found that books published from 2005 to 2008 were 28 times as likely to include profanity than books published in the 1950s, which on one hand, duh, but on the other that’s pretty substantial jump that it’s worth asking questions about. [The New Republic]

48.4 percent
Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan said last week that Wall Street is beating Silicon Valley by a wide margin when it comes to gender equality, and the numbers bear out that thinking: 48.4 percent of top bank’s employees are women, compared to 33.2 percent in the Valley. [Axios]

50.2 percent
U.S. cremation rate in 2016, the first time a majority of Americans favored cremation over the alternatives. The National Funeral Directors Association is forecasting that in 2025, 63.8 percent of people who die in the U.S. will be cremated. [The New York Times]
