2 percent
Donald Trump does not have a lot of support among African-American voters. Just 2 percent of black voters said they were backing Trump in a new national poll by McClatchy-Marist, and he picked up only 1 percent in two other recent national surveys. [@Taniel]

4th place
Trump is also not doing very well among voters aged 18 to 29. When asked who they would vote for in an election held today, 41 percent backed Hillary Clinton, according to that Marist survey. Another 23 percent said they would support Libertarian Gary Johnson, and 16 percent said they would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Oh, and 9 percent said they were for Trump, which lucky for him means he is at least beating some candidate named “undecided,” currently with 8 percent of the youth vote. [McClatchy]

30-40 capybara
Approximate number of capybara — which everyone should know is a large rodent (well, everyone who watched a lot of “The Wild Thornberrys” as a kid like I did) — who reside inside the Rio Olympic golf course perimeter. As far as wildlife you’re liable to encounter in Brazil, you could do worse than a capybara. [SF Gate]

33 American service members
Number of U.S. service members who have contracted the Zika virus, including one pregnant woman. [The New York Times]

98 alleged drug smugglers
Peru, Brazil’s neighbor, is cracking down on drug smugglers in advance of the Olympics: At least 98 people have been arrested at the Lima airport , and law enforcement has confiscated 19.6 tonnes of narcotics. [Yahoo News]

1 lawyer
Michael Barrett, the director of Missouri’s public defender system, says he has a big funding problem. In an unusual letter to the governor, Jay Nixon, Barrett said the state’s public defender system is ranked 49th in the U.S., that its budget has been repeatedly cut, and that he can’t hire enough attorneys for the department to do its job under the current funding level. Luckily, section 600.042.5 of state law allows him to essentially pick any member of the Missouri bar to defend a case if the need arises. So, he’s assigned a case to a prominent Missouri attorney, Gov. Jay Nixon, to prove his point. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

23.9 percent
The reasons why people don’t vote vary; specific demographic groups have different reasons for not making it to the polls. For instance, 23.9 percent of high-income non-voters (making $150,000 or more per year) said they were out-of-town on Election Day, and 42 percent of those non-voters 65 or older cited illness or a disability. [Bloomberg]

47 percent
Percentage of Hillary Clinton supporters who said that they have no close friends who support Donald Trump. For Trump voters, that figure was 31 percent. We’re all in our own bubbles. [Pew Research Center]

1.9 million homes
According to Zillow, that’s the number of homes that could be affected by rising sea levels related to climate change by 2100. All those houses, about 2 percent of those in the U.S., are worth about $882 billion. [Zillow]

$60 million
A 40-year-old Nigerian known as “Mike” has been arrested by INTERPOL and the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crime Commission. They allege he’s behind $60 million worth of online scams that used malware to compromise email accounts and commit fraud. [INTERPOL]

$82 million
Amount of money raised by Trump and the Republican National Committee last month, according to the Trump campaign. That’s a huge improvement from Trump’s previous fundraising pace. [The New York Times]

Younger millennials are more than twice as likely as the previous generation to not be having sex in their early 20s, according to a new study published Tuesday. Apparently, there’s been too much Netflix and not enough “chill.” [The Washington Post]

3 staffers
Three senior officials at the Democratic National Committee resigned Tuesday — more fallout from the 20,000 hacked DNC emails WikiLeaks published last month. [The New York Times]

5 tech companies
For the first time, the five largest companies by market value, at the close of business Monday, were all tech companies: Apple, Alphabet (which is the new fancy way of pronouncing “Google”), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. [Bloomberg]

27.4 gallons
Average amount of bottled water each American will drink this year, according to Euromonitor. That’s about a gallon more than the projection for soda — a first. As a Diet Coke addict who also has club soda with his liquor, I have no idea how to feel about this. Somewhat fittingly, I found this statistic thanks to: [Bloomberg]

94 percent
The Greeks are very unhappy with the governmental response to the recent record-breaking influx of refugees to the European Union: 94 percent of Greeks surveyed by the Pew Research Center reported they disapproved of how the E.U. was handling the issue, the highest of any nation surveyed. [Pew Research Center]

3 batarangs
Number of batarangs — the signature boomerang used by Batman, who is probably not a real person — confiscated last week from a flier’s carry-on baggage by the Transportation Security Administration at San Francisco International Airport. Surprisingly, this kind of thing happens a lot, at least according to the TSA’s Instagram feed. (This is the same helpful agency that taught all of us that they know when you try to smuggle weed through security in peanut butter jars.) [The Hollywood Reporter]

9 percent
Percentage of the U.S. that voted for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the presidential primaries. “Haha, great job, people,” is something you can say without alienating the vast majority of Americans. [The New York Times]

51 percent
Gallup found that 36 percent of Americans said they were more likely to vote for Trump based on what they saw at the Republican National Convention; 51 percent said they were less likely. Among the 16 conventions for which Gallup has asked this question (since 1984), the 2016 GOP convention is the only one to get more negative reviews than positive reviews. [Gallup]

90 percent
An Associated Press study of Rio de Janeiro’s waterways — you know, the ones that a bunch of Olympic and Paralympic events will be held in — found “infectious adenovirus readings” at nearly 90 percent of test sites. [The Independent]

Washington’s attorney general filed a $100 million lawsuit against Comcast, claiming the company violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act at least 1.8 million times by, among other things, selling basically worthless “protection plans.” [KOMO News]

Two branches of Byron, a burger chain in the U.K., were targeted by activists angered by the company’s cooperation with an immigration raid on its staff. The protesters released hundreds of crickets and cockroaches into two Byron restaurants in London. [The Guardian]

6 potential heirs
Prince, who died earlier this year, did not leave behind a will and had no known children. So, naturally, a whole bunch of people have come out of the woodwork claiming to be related to him. A judge overseeing Prince’s estate has thrown out nearly 30 such claims but is moving forward with DNA testing for six purported relatives. [The New Zealand Herald]

39 years
The Air Force has raised its maximum age of enlistment from 27 to 39 years. This puts it at the high end of America’s armed forces, as the Army’s max age of enlistment is 35, the Navy’s is 34 and the Marines’ is 28. [Stars And Stripes]

62 percent
The probability that Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on Nov. 8, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus model. Historically, polls conducted during and around the conventions have not been very predictive, but the polls-plus model attempts to account for each candidate’s convention bounce. [FiveThirtyEight]

Expected number of security personnel who will be present when the Rio Olympics kick off this week. [Yahoo Sports]

CORRECTION (Aug. 3, 11:54 a.m.): A previous version of this article misidentified the vehicle from which Luke Aikins jumped. It was a plane, not a helicopter.

5 years old
Age of a kid who got his head stuck in a panel at the Hall of Advanced Mammals at the American Museum of Natural History. If that wasn’t the core plot point of “Night at the Museum” it will surely be the core plot point of “Night at the Museum 4: Ben Stiller Wants To Buy A Damn Island So We Made Another One.” [AM New York]

Number of mannequins stolen in Belleville, Ontario from different storefronts since May, which is all kinds of messed up. All of them were women-shaped mannequins in various states of undress, so I’m pretty much done writing about this mess and I want to be done with this story, thank you. [The Guardian]

Number of years worth of tax returns Donald Trump will release, according to an announcement from his campaign chief Paul Manafort. This is highly unusual, as presidential nominees and their vice presidents typically make several recent tax returns available. [The Hill]

22 percentage points
It’s looking like Donald Trump is pushing Catholics into the Democratic party. Catholics who attend mass weekly — a group that slightly supported Mitt Romney in June 2012 — have shifted 22 points leftward in June 2016, and now support Hillary Clinton in greater numbers than even Catholics who attend mass less than weekly. [FiveThirtyEight]

35 years
John Hinckley Jr. — who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan — has spent the past 35 years in a mental institution. He’s made substantial progress since: He spends 17 days per month with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, and has convalesced to the point that a federal judge has granted him his freedom. He’ll be allowed to remain free provided he follows several restrictions, including no travel to areas where the president or members of congress will be. [NPR]

29 percent
FiveThirtyEight’s election model doesn’t mess around with internal polling, but here’s something interesting out of Utah: Two weeks ago an internal poll for Republican Rep. Mia Love’s campaign found support for Trump at only 29 percent in the state, Clinton at 27 percent and Gary Johnson at 26 percent. [The Salt Lake Tribune]

32 percent
Pokemon Go is a hit on mobile, prompting investors to send Nintendo’s stock up and up and up. The problem? Nintendo reminded investors Friday that it only owns 32 percent of the Pokemon Company, which made the app with Niantic Labs, thus sending Nintendo’s stock down as far as 17 percent at one point Monday. [The Verge]

46 percent
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are closer than ever in our forecast. That’s because of some combination of a Republican National Convention bounce for Trump, the last few weeks of bad news for Hillary Clinton, and Trump’s overall positive trend since the end of the primaries. According to the polls-only forecast, there’s a 46 percent chance Trump becomes president. Based on the now-cast, he has a 54 percent chance of winning if the election were held today.

0.7; 24; 50,000
Huge weekend in politics! Given that you read our website, you’ve likely heard that there’s a convention happening. But here’s a quick catch up to get everyone on the same page: Sen. Tim Kaine was tapped to be Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential nominee, and the pick adds about 0.7 points to Clinton’s probability of winning the election based on historical performance of Veep nominees in their home states and Virginia’s overall importance to the board. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has resigned less than 24 hours before the start of the convention after emails were leaked that showed the DNC working against Sanders during the Democratic primary. And finally, FiveThirtyEight is in Philadelphia along with an estimated 50,000 protestors a day, so things looks like they could get weird. [FiveThirtyEight, CNN, The Morning Call]

10 cents
Deposit amount in the state of Michigan for a recyclable can. When you return a can in Michigan to get recycled, you get 10 cents back. This is not the case in many other states, where the deposit is 5 cents. A Michigan man allegedly attempted to exploit this arbitrage opportunity by hauling upwards of 10,000 cans across the border to deposit for profit. The problem: Trying to mass import cans for redemption is illegal. He could face up to five years in prison, though legal experts are unsure if just being caught transporting the cans (rather than depositing them) is enough for a conviction. [The Guardian]

Did you know that there is still at least one company making VCRs? It would appear that that company — Funai Electric — noticed that they were still somehow making 750,000 VCRs per year and will stop doing that by the end of the month. At the format’s peak, Funai was cranking out 15 million units per year. It’s only a matter of time before a VCR maintenance, repair and resale shop opens up in Brooklyn, isn’t it? [ABC News]

Following a decision by its board of directors, Yahoo! will sell its internet and land holdings — including the stupid exclamation point I presume — to Verizon for $4.8 billion. In January 2000, the company was worth about $125 billion. [The New York Times]
