House Bill 2
The NBA has moved ahead with its declared intention to move the 2017 All-Star game out of Charlotte as long as House Bill 2, a law that prevents local government from expanding protections for LGBT people and keeps the group out of anti-discrimination policies, remains on the books. New Orleans is being eyed as the new host. The league says it will consider Charlotte to host the 2019 All-Star game. [Yahoo Sports]

10 arrested
Ten people were arrested in Brazil two weeks before the start of the Olympic games in connection with a group that allegedly plotted an act of terror. [BBC]

15 days
Time between Gretchen Carlson filing a sexual harassment suit against Roger Ailes and Ailes’s ouster as the head of Fox News. [@Radhikajones]

21 minutes
Amount of time Ted Cruz spoke on Wednesday night of the GOP convention, during which he neglected to, you know, endorse the nominee. This was a problem, because Cruz was only allotted 12 minutes initially, later updated to 20. Cruz running long managed to contribute to pushing vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s address right out of prime time. [The New York Times]

40.1 percent
Probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency of the United States of America, according to the latest FiveThirtyEight polls-plus projection. Last night he officially accepted the Republican nomination. [FiveThirtyEight]

54 miles of bike lanes
Average annual addition of bike lanes in the city of New York since 2007, which has led to a substantial decrease in the risk involved in biking in the hellhole of a city. [Streetsblog]

After a coup attempt against him failed, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has declared a three-month state of emergency. [The Associated Press]

Relevant weeklong sidebar: It’s the Republican National Convention! FiveThirtyEight has sent its crack political team — and also for some inexplicable reason me — to “the Cleve” (as it was called on “30 Rock” so I assume it’s true) to cover the events. FiveThirtyEight has its own show on ABC News Digital at 5 p.m. ET each evening of the convention, so tune in to that! I’ll be on the stream later on in the evening, so watch that too.

23 December 1888
That’s the date Vincent Van Gogh sent a young woman a portion of his ear. Until yesterday, almost 130 years later, we never knew her name: Gabrielle Berlatier. [The Guardian]

80 percent
The newest Gorilla Glass — the cell phone screen glass designed to resist breaking from moderate falls — is reported to survive falls of 5.25 feet 80 percent of the time. As a person who has single-handedly carried out a long series of stress tests on my phone — resulting in the untimely smashing of way more than I would prefer to acknowledge — I think this is great news. [The Verge]

€280 million
Ireland’s 2015 GDP growth rate came in blazing hot at 26 percent, but it’s not the result of actual growth. It’s largely due to companies dumping assets into the country, thanks to its favorable tax regime. This means Ireland will now owe a further €280 million to the European Union, which calculates members’ contributions in part on GDP. [The Irish Times]

$1 billion
Dollar Shave Club, which sends its 3.2 million members disposable razors on a regular schedule and also has never made a profit, was bought by Unilever for a reported $1 billion. [BBC]

1 in 1 trillion
Approximate probability that a 16-word phrase in one speech would coincidentally match a phrase of the same length in another speech, according to the company that makes Turnitin, a plagiarism-detection program. On Monday night, Melania Trump appears to have partially plagiarized Michelle Obama’s 2008 speech to the Democratic National Convention. [Turnitin]

Up to 11 members of the California delegation to the Republican National Convention are showing symptoms of a norovirus infection, a disease that spreads quickly in close quarters and ends with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. [STAT News]

+18 points
A pervasive theme of the Republican National Convention has been that the world is in a state of disarray. Still, based on several metrics averaged across a number of polls in the FiveThirtyEight database, Americans trust Clinton more than Trump on foreign policy by an average 24-point margin, during an international crisis by an average 18-point margin, and on immigration by an average 9-point margin. They do trust Trump on terrorism more than Clinton, but by an average 3-point margin, and on the economy and jobs by a 7-point margin. [FiveThirtyEight]

99 percent
Based on calculations from NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, there is now a 99 percent chance 2016 will be hotter than 2015. [The New York Times]

750 cars
Up to 750 New York City subway cars could include open passageways connecting the cars by 2020, which is an awful, awful idea. Here’s the skinny for those unfamiliar with the New York City subway system. Right now, there’s no easy way (beyond opening doors you sometimes can but are not supposed to open) to travel between cars. This is considered an antiquated system in modern transit design. But in New York, there is a very, very good reason to not give up on this system, and that’s a little something I call stench containment. See, sometimes someone will do something horrible  in a subway car. The subways run 24/7. This happens irregularly, but consistently. It will smell like someone pooped everywhere and then died and exploded everywhere, et cetera and literally ad nauseum. In the current arrangement, this situation will ruin at most one car. In the new one, you have ruined a train. This is a bad idea. [The New York Times]

60,000 ads
Number of television advertisements aired by the Clinton campaign and the primary super PAC advocating for Clinton since June 8. Pro-Trump groups have aired less than 3,000 ads. [The Center for Public Integrity]

1st row
Front-row seating at the Republican National Convention has been given to a very weird and occasionally blue group of states: Alabama, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, California and Pennsylvania. At the same time, the host state, Ohio, was nowhere near the front, and two GOP stalwarts, Texas and Utah, were so far back they may as well be in Akron. It’s all part of a strange calculation that seems to have something to do with Trump’s primary margin in the state. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 episodes
Saddening yet expected news from HBO regarding “Game of Thrones”: Season 7 won’t be back until next summer, and when it does come out it will only be made up of seven episodes. [EW]

46 months
Christopher Correa — the former scouting director for the Cardinals, who was convicted of hacking the Astro’s personnel database — has been sentenced to 46 months of incarceration. He also has to pay $279,038. [The Guardian]

501(c)(6)
Speed bump for the Democratic National Convention’s Philadelphia host committee: for unknown reasons the IRS declined the DNC’s application for 501(c)(3) status, which would have made it a not-for-profit charity. That designation would have the lovely effect of allowing donors to the charity to get a deduction on their taxes. The RNC’s convention committee is a 501(c)(3), so donors do get a tax write-off. The DNC planners are appealing the IRS’s decision, but have considered becoming a 501(c)(6) group, technically a trade association, if they can’t get their way. [The Center for Public Integrity]

1.68 million subscribers
Netflix missed its target of 2 million new subscribers in the second quarter, adding only 1.68 million subscribers. [Bloomberg]

$4.5 billion
Nintendo has had a monster week in the stock market in light of the success of Pokemon Go, but last Friday was record-setting: It’s now the most-traded Japanese company by value of shares on any one day in this century. About 476 billion yen, or $4.5 billion, worth of Nintendo stock was traded. I presume the stock will evolve into a Golem, Machamp, Gengar or Alakazam. [Polygon]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Last Wednesday, FiveThirtyEight launched an in-depth look at gun violence in America. For the final time, Significant Digits is going to highlight that work. 

1 in 3,400
Share of gun homicides in the U.S. from 2002 to 2014 that occurred in a terrorist attack. In the rest of the world, at least one of every 40 people shot to death died in a terrorist attack. [FiveThirtyEight]
40 to 80 percent
The range of estimated banned guns recovered under Australia’s buyback program. [FiveThirtyEight]
62.7 percent
Nearly two-thirds of all gun deaths in the U.S. each year are suicides. Explore the data on gun deaths in America, including on homicides and accidents, in our interactive graphic and read about some of the potential solutions in our multi-part package. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 points
Usually, it’s Republican candidates who gain an edge when a poll shifts from registered voters to likely voters. That’s not the case this time around: An ABC News poll found that while Clinton had a 4-point edge over Trump among registered voters, that edge expanded to 7 points when refining to likely voters. [ABC News]

$235,941
It’s looking like Tom Brady will indeed be suspended for four games next season after losing his appeals against the NFL in court, but he did make a smart financial move in April to minimize the impact: Brady restructured his contract to categorize most of the money he makes this year as a signing bonus rather than salary, meaning the losses from missing four game checks amount to $235,941 rather than $2.11 million. [NBC Sports]

$200 million
Herbalife will pay $200 million in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to customers who were deceived into believing that they could make lots of money by selling Herbalife stuff. The company will also have to restructure its business.[FTC]

CORRECTION (July 18, 11 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated Clinton’s lead over Trump in the latest ABC News poll. She led by 4 points among registered voters, not 47 points. (Her share of registered voters in the poll was 47 percent.)

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. On Wednesday, FiveThirtyEight launched an in-depth look at guns in America. Significant Digits is going to highlight that work over the next few editions. 

80 percent
Nearly 80 percent of New Orleans murder victims in 2015 were black men. [FiveThirtyEight]

3,411 years
A program focused on tough federal sentences for gun offenders in Rochester, New York, has put 633 people behind bars for a total of 3,411 years. But it’s unclear what effect that has had on gun violence in the city. [FiveThirtyEight]

$52.1 million
Taser International signed deals to provide police departments with body cameras worth $52.1 million in the first three months of this year, nine times the company’s sales in the equivalent period of 2014. [FiveThirtyEight]

3.6 out of 10
The new “Ghostbusters” hits theaters this weekend, and despite — or because of — all of the controversy around it, it has managed to become a perfect articulation of a fundamental issue with online ratings systems. Men on IMDb rate the movie 3.6 out of 10, while women have it at 7.7 out of ten. It’s up to you to decide whether or not every one of those 12,000 ratings come from someone who’s seen the movie, which went into wide release Thursday night. [FiveThirtyEight]

-6 points
Mike Pence is reportedly Donald Trump’s vice presidential choice. Still, the Indiana governor is rather unknown to voters — only 23 percent of voters have an opinion of him, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, and that opinion is more negative (15 percent) than positive (9 percent). Trump has moved his VP announcement — originally intended for 11 a.m. today — to sometime in the future because of the terrorist attack in Nice, France. [FiveThirtyEight]

23 nominations
Emmy award nominations are out, and “Game of Thrones” leads the pack with 23 overall nominations. Fear not, as our queen Julia Louis-Dreyfus is once again nominated for best lead actress in a comedy. All is right in the world. [TIME]

3 times as likely
Middle-age men in Wyoming are three times more likely to die by suicide than the average American. [FiveThirtyEight]

17.97
The suicide rate per 100,000 person-years for active-duty soldiers who work in mechanical and electrical repair. A 2013 study found that that group has a higher suicide rate than soldiers whose jobs place them on the front line in combat positions. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,871
The number of accidental gun deaths recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1981. By 2014, the number of accidental gun deaths had fallen by more than half. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 answered phones
The Huffington Post wanted to figure out the depth of Donald Trump’s ground game, so they called up the Trump campaign contact number in each of the 50 states. Someone picked up the phone in a mere six states. Fifteen states — including New York — have listed numbers that go to Trump campaign headquarters in New York City. This is not how this usually works: Clinton reportedly has 100 offices in 14 states, and staff in 45. [The Huffington Post]

28 percent
Percentage of registered Democratic voters who are religiously unaffiliated, according to a Pew Research Center study. Among all religiously unaffiliated voters, the demographic is breaking strongly for Hillary Clinton, with 67 percent saying they would vote for Clinton compared to 23 percent who would vote for Trump. [Pew Research Center]

$400,000
The Draken Harald Hårfagre, a viking ship that left Norway in April and is headed towards Duluth, Minnesota for a festival, needs some cash. Because of maritime regulations, the Draken will have to come up with $400,000 to pay for a pilot to navigate the Great Lakes or schlep it like some bargain-bin Leif Erikson back to Scandinavia. Organizers are scrambling to find a way to get the ship in port, lest Tall Ships Duluth 2016 lose its star attraction. [Star Tribune]

14 months
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both closed at all-time highs Tuesday. Yesterday saw the Dow’s first record high in roughly 14 months. [Marketwatch]

26 percent
How much the Irish economy grew in 2015, which even the nation’s highest economists consider laughable. The absurdly high growth rate is likely the result of overseas companies dumping a crap-load of assets in Ireland due to their tax structure, which encourages corporations to base their assets in the country. [Bloomberg]

31
Number of campaigns for Congress that have received at least 75 percent of their monetary contributions from out of state in the 2016 cycle, up from 16 campaigns in 2012. [The Center for Responsive Politics]

44 years, 7 months, 14 days
Looks like he got away with it: On Monday the FBI announced as of July 8 it was no longer investigating the notorious D.B. Cooper case. In 1971, Cooper (or someone going by Cooper) hijacked a plane, pulled in $200,000 and jumped out of the aircraft to unknown ends. It was a 44 year, 7 month, 14 day investigation. [Newser]

67 percent
67 percent of Americans aged 65 and older are white and say they are Christians. But only 29 percent of those aged 18 to 29 are white Christians. That massive gap is going to drive huge changes in generations to come. Indeed, 34 percent of those 18 to 29 were unaffiliated with a religion, compared to 11 percent of those 65 and up. [The Atlantic]

The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled on border disputes in the South China Sea, issuing a 479-page decision that favored the Philippines’ claims to the sea territory over China’s. [Bloomberg]

6 years
After Theresa May’s last remaining opponent dropped out of the race to succeed David Cameron, May is set to be the U.K.’s next prime minister. Cameron will resign Wednesday and will have to personally tell the queen he’s leaving and who his successor will be, in possibly the greatest and most galling democratic tradition. May has served for the past six years as Cameron’s Home Secretary. [ABC News]

19 seasons
Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs has retired after 19 seasons in the NBA. He’ll go down as one of the greatest ever despite his soft-spoken demeanor. [FiveThirtyEight]

17,000 square feet
New documents indicate a 17,000-square-foot LED screen will be built in Times Square, because we must bathe New York in constant daylight at all hours one block at a time. Still, it will be smaller than the largest sign in the world, a screen at 7 Times Square, which is currently under construction. [New York YIMBY]

$10 million
Former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh has started a campaign for the Indiana Senate seat up for grabs in November. He has at least 10 million reasons to do so, as his old campaign account still remains flush. He puts the Indiana seat — contested on the right by Rep. Todd Young — very much in play. [CNN]

$4 billion
UFC, the mixed martial arts league, has been sold to talent agency WME-IMG as well as several other parties for a reported $4 billion. Talk about return on investment: The MMA organization was originally purchased for $2 million in 2000. [The Washington Post]

$9 billion
The numbers are still very much in flux, but the release of the hit alternate reality gaming app Pokemon Go has sent the value of Nintendo skyrocketing. The game added $7.5 billion to the value of the company in the two days since the game’s release, and $9 billion total after Monday trading. [CNBC, The Atlantic, Wall Street Journal]

1-0
Portugal defeated France 1-0 in the championship game of the Euro 2016 soccer tournament in the Stade de France Sunday. This win was accompanied by an unrelenting assault on the stadium by an army of moths, which I presume was either from a low-rent Icelandic or Welsh super-villain, or someone who forgot to turn the world’s largest porch light off. [The Guardian, Quartz]

2 years
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Friday that it will ban Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes from performing blood tests for two years, and that it will revoke Theranos’s license for the company’s lab in California, indicating that the safety of patients is in jeopardy. The company — which voided some test results from 2014 and 2015 — has returned inaccurate blood tests. There’s still time to appeal, but the decision is a hugely consequential one for the once-$9 billion start up. [Wall Street Journal]

22 majors
Serena Williams won her 22nd major title at Wimbledon Saturday, tying the record set by Steffi Graf for majors won in the Open-era. Nine of those wins came after Williams turned 30, putting her into an elite class. [FiveThirtyEight]

Rule 40
Are you ready for some RNC intrigue? I totally am. A group of delegates to the Republican National Committee do not want Trump to be the standard bearer of its party. This group is probably going to fail. So what’s next? Mild irritation to the nominee. A delegate faction is pushing a change to Rule 40 of the convention rules to give them a stronger route to reject the nominee’s preferred veep, making it easier to get alternate candidates in the mix. [Buzzfeed]

1985
A 29-year-old bullfighter was gored Saturday on live television, leading to his death. He’s the first professional to die in a Spanish bullfight since 1985. [Time]

$5,400
In the 2012 presidential election, board members of the Republican Jewish Coalition donated at least $16.5 million to the campaign and supporting super PAC of nominee Mitt Romney. Donald Trump — who fired off a tweet last week that has been called anti-semitic — has raised merely $5,400 from board members through May. It’s just one niche of the GOP that Trump has struggled to win over, contributing to his overall fundraising shortfall. [Wall Street Journal]
