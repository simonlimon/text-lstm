23 percent
Percentage of traditional retail jobs in the U.S. located in rural and small metropolitan areas. On the other hand, only 13 percent of e-commerce jobs are in rural or small metros. As the retail business moves increasingly to urban centers and online, the bottom may be falling out for the industry in rural areas already hit by manufacturing closures. [The New York Times]

93 percent
GOP Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada could be the deciding vote on the Senate bill to roll back the Affordable Care Act. He’s voted in line with President Trump’s stated position on legislation 93 percent of the time thus far. [FiveThirtyEight]

$772 billion
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the GOP’s Senate health care bill on Monday. The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 would cut $772 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, and 15 million fewer people would be on the program’s rolls. Overall, 28 million Americans are projected to be without insurance in 2026 under current law; the CBO says it would be 49 million people under the Senate bill. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 U.S. House seats
An Associated Press study of U.S. House races found that Republicans may have gained up to 22 additional seats in the 2016 election due to redistricting. The AP’s analysis also found four times as many states with GOP-skewed state legislative maps as Democratic-skewed ones. [The Associated Press]

37 percent
Kentucky’s government employee pension system is in bad shape. The pensions managed by Kentucky Retirement Systems “had just 37 percent of the money required to pay current and future retirees.” And the state isn’t doing those retirees any favors: It’s way more reliant on “alternative investments” — pricey hedge funds and private equity — than its peers. So far, the result has been higher costs and lower returns. [The Huffington Post]

$435,000
Expected opening weekend take for “The Big Sick.” And Kumail Nanjiani’s romantic-comedy opened in just five locations, giving it the highest per-screen average gross of any film released in 2017 — a good sign for the film. [Variety]

1 million deaths
A White House budget proposal cuts $1.1 billion from a George W. Bush-era program that funds antiretroviral drugs for people with H.I.V. in sub-Saharan Africa. That kind of cut could lead to an estimated 1 million additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, according to researchers. [The New York Times]

1.4 million people
That’s the number of Americans who live in nursing homes, and Medicaid pays for most of their costs. In the U.S., 64 percent of people in nursing homes rely on Medicaid, so the Medicaid cuts in the Republican health care law could have far-reaching consequences for them. [The New York Times]

Takata, the company that makes the airbags that have been linked to at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

49 percent
The health care bill proposed by the Senate GOP would cut taxes on the wealthy and cut programs like Medicaid. It could also affect some of the 49 percent of Americans who get insurance through their jobs, by no longer requiring employers to offer health insurance. [FiveThirtyEight]

Teens are using protection when having sex for the first time! From 2011 to 2015, 81 percent of teen girls in the U.S. used contraception the first time they had sex. [STAT News]

On Friday, a judge declared a mistrial in the case of sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby after the jury was unable to come to a verdict in several days of deliberations.

1 human toe
A bar in Dawson City, Yukon, has lost its iconic human toe, which it uses in a horrifying local tradition where a shot of whiskey is consumed with the digit floating in the glass. The penalty assessed by the bar is $2,500 for swallowing or stealing the toe, up from $500 after someone several years ago swallowed the toe and simply threw down $500. They want the toe returned. [CBC]

1.7 percent
Tuition costs rose at the slowest rate on record, going up 1.7 percent in May from a year earlier. This highlights an interesting and crazy stat: College tuition and fees have never, ever gone down in the nearly four decades that the measure has been tracked as part of the Consumer Price Index. They’ve slowed down the pace of that increase, but still; even like food and steel get less expensive sometimes. [Vice]

51.9 percent
With 51.9 percent of the vote, Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff to win the special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District by about 4 percentage points.

With the opioid crisis continuing to grow, researchers wondered whether teens and young adults struggling with addiction are actually getting the recommended treatment.

Gorillas in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo are a huge boost for local tourism, which helps fund conservation efforts. The problem? Adeptly reading the room, the gorillas are absolutely terrified of white people. Fighting in the Congo killed off 77 percent of the country’s Grauer’s gorillas, including nearly all of the ones habituated to humans. The ability of locals to make the gorillas comfortable with foreign tourists could be essential for their survival. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.3 billion
President Donald Trump has earned at least $1.3 billion in revenue since he announced his bid for the presidency in June 2015. Turns out politics can be pretty lucrative.

$22 billion
Amazon announced Friday that it’s buying Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, and the market reaction was swift and unmerciful for other grocery chains, which could be threatened by the internet juggernaut’s move into their turf. All told, $22 billion in market value was wiped out from grocery-related stocks on Friday with Kroger, Target and Walmart all taking a hit. [CNN Money]

Indenting lines is an essential grammatical component of programming. Some people indent using the tab key, and others indent using consecutive spaces. It’s all user preference, but as with many banal things, your preference is an essential cultural signifier in certain circles. A survey by Stack Overflow, which I imagine sees a lot of this crap, found that the median developer who prefers spaces made just over $59,140 and the median developer who preferred tabs made $43,750.

Urban areas have tried to cut down on the number of people incarcerated before their trials to reduce the population behind bars, but rural jails haven’t followed suit.
