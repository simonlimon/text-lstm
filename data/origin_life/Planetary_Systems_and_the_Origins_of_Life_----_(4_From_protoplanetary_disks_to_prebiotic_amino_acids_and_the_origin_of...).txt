4.1 Introduction
The robust formation of planets as well as abundant sources of water and organic
molecules are likely to be important prerequisites for the wide-spread appearance
of life in the cosmos. The nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace was the ﬁrst
to propose that the formation of planets occurs in gaseous disks around stars.
The construction of new infrared and submillimetre observatories over the last
decade and a half has resulted in the discovery of protoplanetary discs around
most, if not all, forming stars regardless of their mass (e.g., reviews by Meyer et al.
(2006), Dutrey et al. (2006)). The recent discoveries of extrasolar planets in over
a hundred planetary systems provides good evidence that Jovian planets, at least,
may be relatively abundant around solar-like stars (see Chapter 1). These results
beg the question of whether protoplanetary disks are also natural settings for the
manufacture of the molecular prerequisites for life. Life requires water and organic
molecules such as amino acids, sugars, nucleobases, and lipids as building blocks
out of which biological macromolecules and cellular structures are made, and many
of these can be manufactured in protoplanetary disks.
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter we review the properties of protoplanetary disks
and how planets are believed to form within them. We then consider the evidence
that these disks may be a major source of the water and biomolecules available
for the earliest life, as on the Earth. We focus on amino acids because they
are the key components of proteins and more is known about prebiotic synthesis
of amino acids than most other biomolecules. In the second part of this review,
we compare the different environments that have been proposed for amino acid
synthesis – including the atmosphere, hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean, and
protoplanetary disks – and show that there is considerable consensus on which
amino acids can be formed prebiotically, even if there is still disagreement on the
location.

We will argue that the amino acids that were least thermodynamically costly
to form were the ones that were most abundant before life arose. Early organisms
could make use of existing amino acids in the ﬁrst proteins. Later organisms evolved
biochemical pathways to synthesize additional amino acids that were not common
prebiotically, thus increasing the diversity and functional speciﬁcity of the proteins
they could make.
The synthesis of speciﬁc proteins is only possible after the origin of the genetic
code (i.e., the mapping between codons in RNA and amino acids in proteins). We
will discuss the origin of the genetic code in the context of our understanding
of prebiotic amino acid frequencies. We will also consider the evidence that the
genetic code is optimized to reduce translational error and discuss how it came to be
this way.
It is likely that early proteins were composed of a smaller set of amino
acids than the 20 used currently. We will discuss several experimental studies
of proteins composed of deliberately reduced amino acid sets that indicate that
properly folded and functional structures could have formed in such proteins.
Bioinformatics techniques can also be used to make predictions about early proteins.
For example, using molecular phylogenetics it is possible to estimate the most likely
ancestral sequence for a given set of related proteins. Several studies indicate that
the abundances of amino acids in the ancestral proteins differed from average
abundances in modern organisms. It is possible that this is a relic of a time when
only a subset of amino acids was used.

4.2 Protoplanetary disks and the formation of planet systems
Stars and planets form within dense, cold clouds of gas and dust, known as molecular
clouds. Surveys of many molecular clouds show that most stars form as members of
entire star clusters. These stellar nurseries arise from dense regions within molecular
clouds known as clumps which extend over about 1 pc in physical scale (or about
3 light years, or 205 000 astronomical units – AU – where 1 AU = 1.5 × 1013
cm is the distance between the Earth and the Sun) and typical initial temperatures
around 20 K. The gas in clouds and clumps is stirred vigorously by supersonic
turbulence which also generates its ﬁlamentary structure. A single star, or a binary
stellar system, forms within a small, dense subregion of a clump (known as a core)
that, for stars like the Sun, extends over a scale of 0.04 pc and has a (particle)
number density ranging from 104 to 108 cm−3 .
Numerical simulations of supersonic turbulent gas under the observed conditions
show how stars and their protoplanetary disks form. Supersonic turbulence ﬁrst
sweeps up the gas into systems of shocked sheets and ﬁlaments. Dense core-like
regions are produced as such ﬂows develop. Also, the shock waves that produce

the cores are oblique and hence impart spin to the cores (see MacLow and Klessen
(2004) for a review). The eventual gravitational collapse of such slowly spinning
cores under their own weight preserves most of their angular momentum, resulting
in the formation of protoplanetary disks (e.g., Tilley and Pudritz (2004)).
Surveys of star-forming regions have established that disks are universal around
solar mass stars. Stars range over more than three decades in mass, and for all of
them, one has evidence for disks. The least massive of these is the disk around
an object that has only 15 MJ (Jovian masses)! (Note, the mass of Jupiter is one
thousandth the mass of the sun; MJ = 0.001 M .) Disks are commonly observed
around solar-like stars as they form. At the most massive end, rotating disks have
been found around B stars that are up to 10 M (e.g., Schreyer et al. (2005)).
Most studies generally do not resolve a disk around a star but infer its presence
from the excess of infrared emission that is seen in the spectrum of the star. Disks
around forming solar-type stars typically extend out to more than 100 AU, with the
temperature varying as a function of the radius r. In our Solar System, the orbital
radius of the Earth around the Sun is 1 AU, while that of the most massive outer
planet, Neptune, is 30 AU. The total emission from this collection of rings of gas
and dust, each of which emits radiation like a blackbody, adds up to the observed
excess infrared emission (known as the spectral energy distribution or SED).
For solar-type stars, the disk temperature that can be inferred from such
observations scales with disk radius as T ∝ r −0.6 , with a temperature at 100 AU of
about 30 K. Similarly, one can deduce that the column density of the disk (which
is the volume density integrated over the disk thickness at a given radius) varies as
 ∝ r −1.5 and has a value at 100 AU of 0.8 g cm−2 . Disks seen at these later stages
of their evolution are far less massive than are their central stars, having typically
10−2 M of gas and dust (e.g., Dutrey et al. (2006)). Hence, their dynamics are
governed by the gravitational ﬁeld of the central star, and the material is expected
√
to be in nearly Keplerian orbit about the star (i.e., vKep (r) = (GM∗ /r)).
Occasionally, one can also spatially resolve the disk around a young star. The
rotation curves of the disks can be measured under such conditions, as has been
done in molecular observations (Simon et al., 2000), and these have been found to
be nearly Keplerian. At a slightly later stage (a few hundred thousand years), after
the surrounding cloud is blown away by the young massive star, stars and their
disks still in formation can be seen in optical images. This is seen in the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) image in Figure 4.1, where we see several images of young
stars that are forming in the Orion Nebula Cluster. A massive star has created a
strongly illuminated background of glowing nebular gas. The HST image shows
a disk around each young star which is seen as a silhouette against this bright
background (McCaughrean and Stauffer, 1994). Disks are heated primarily by the
young star that they surround as well as by a massive nearby star in the case of

clustered star formation. They are also illuminated by ultraviolet radiation as well
as X-rays from the central star, and this drives the production of organic molecules
(as we discuss in the next section).
Studies of the frequency of disks in Orion also allow us to determine their
lifetimes. One can calibrate the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks because one can
measure the ages of the young stars that they encompass. The result is that 50% of
disks are gone by 3 million years after formation, and 90% are gone by 5 million
years. This lifetime for disks translates into a hard upper limit for the time for the
formation of massive Jovian planets. While Jupiter has an 8–10 Earth mass core,

its bulk consists of gas that was accreted from the protoplanetary disk in which it
formed.
The building of planets and molecules depends, in part, on the balance between
carbon and oxygen in the molecular gas within protoplanetary disks (e.g., Gaidos
and Selsis (2006)). These two elements are the most abundant in the interstellar
medium after hydrogen and helium and are predominantly bound in the form of
CO in molecular clouds. During gravitational collapse, however, the presence of
high pressure can shift this balance in favour of the formation of water and methane
(CH4 ) from CO and molecular hydrogen. Thus, if there is an excess of O over C,
then the extra O is taken up in the formation of water (through combination with
abundant molecular hydrogen). In the converse case, an excess of C over O is used
up in the formation of graphite and organic molecules. The balance between C and
O depends on the condensation and sedimentation of grains.
While the bulk of the mass of disks is dominated by gas, dust grains play several
important roles. Dust grains in more diffuse gas consist of a mixture of silicates
and carbon, with sizes ranging typically from 100 Å to 0.2–0.3 µm. Once dust
starts to collect in denser environments such as protostellar disks, it grows by
agglomeration via collisions. This growth continues up to the scale of kilometresized objects (called planetesimals) and, eventually, planets. Dust grains, while still
small, are the dominant form of opacity in protostellar disks and effectively absorb
the ultraviolet radiation that falls on disks from their central and surrounding stars
(e.g., Natta et al. (2006)).
Models of terrestrial planet formation agree that the process starts as dust
settles onto the midplane of protoplanetary disks (see Chapter 3). In the earliest
phases, dust grains condense and grow by collisions with other dust grains,
gradually settling to the disk midplane as they become more massive. After
the formation of planetesimals, an ‘oligarchic’ growth phase occurs wherein
gravitational interactions lead to focusing of orbits and collisions of planetesimals
resulting in large numbers of Moon- to Mars-sized objects. At a radial distance of
1 AU from the central star, this process occurs within a million years (e.g., Kokubo
and Ida (2002)). The gaseous disk is still present at this phase. The late collisions
of these oligarchs over 100 My produces a sparse system of massive planets.
If the Earth formed at around 1 AU in such a disk, it must have formed in a
very dry zone without much water. This is because the snow-line for water – that
radius in the protostellar disk which separates a hot inner region of the disk, where
water cannot condense, from an outer region, where the temperature is low enough
for water to freeze out and condense in grains and planetesimals – occurs at 2.5
AU. The Earth’s ocean probably arose as a consequence of the delivery of water
by bodies that formed beyond 2.5 AU and that later collided with the Earth. It is
now thought that water ice in comets is unlikely to be the source, as the deuterium

to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of comets is twice that found in Earth’s water. Perhaps
only 10% of the Earth’s ocean came from a cometary source. It has been suggested
(Morbidelli et al., 2000) that water arrived from the asteroid belt through the impact
of water-laden planetary embryos, such as those discussed above.
Massive planets, such as Jupiter, play a major role in this process. Numerical
simulations (Raymond et al., 2004) show that the presence of a Jovian mass planet
stirs up planetesimals and perturbs them into ever more eccentric orbits. Such orbits
carry the planetary embryos into the hot, dry inner regions of the disk where they can
undergo collisions with the Earth. This is a stochastic process, and the simulations
show that the majority of Earth-like planets that formed in the ‘habitable zone’
(0.8–1.5 AU) have water contents that are within an order of magnitude of that of
the Earth. The water content has a broad range, however, extending from some dry
worlds to a few watery ones that have more than 100 times more water than there
is on Earth.
In fact, massive gas-giant (Jovian) planets play a dominant role in the formation
and evolution of entire planetary systems. How they form is still is unclear, but
there are two major contemporary models that are under intense investigation. The
more popular of these is the core accretion picture wherein a rocky core that grows
to about 5–10 Earth masses can then rapidly accrete gas from the disk. This may
take a few million years, however – uncomfortably close to the observational limit
for disk lifetimes (Pollack et al., 1996). The alternative picture is that Jovian planets
form as a consequence of rapid gravitational instability in a fairly massive disk (e.g.,
Mayer et al. (2002)). Whatever the mechanism of its formation, the ﬁnal mass of
a giant planet is dependent strongly on the structure of the disk (its pressure scale
height) as well as the magnitude of its turbulent viscosity. Jovian planets cease
to grow when their mass (known as the gap-opening mass) is large enough to
exert a torque on their surrounding disks in the face of turbulent viscosity, thereby
opening a signiﬁcant gap in it. The disappearance of the corresponding ring of
emission from the gas at this radius translates into a notch-like feature in the SED,
which can be searched for in the spectra of forming stars. The advent of the highly
sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in the latter part of this decade
will allow such gaps to be imaged directly, as will the emission from the forming
Jupiter (e.g., Wolf and D’Angelo (2005)).
Planets exert signiﬁcant tidal forces on their natal disks and this results in the
inward migration of the planet (Lin and Papaloizou, 1993). This process is quite
general and explains why the newly discovered extrasolar planets observed around
solar-type stars have orbits well within 5 AU and sometimes at the equivalent radius
of the orbit of Mercury (see Chapter 1). Jupiter mass planets are thought to have
formed at much larger disk radii, where gas is more abundant, and migrated to
their present positions. Models show that planets can migrate very quickly – within

a million years or so – and are liable to be swallowed by the star. This presents
a problem as to why there are any planetary systems in the ﬁrst place. Also, the
migration of massive planets will strongly perturb the smaller terrestrial planets
and this is of profound signiﬁcance for the origin of life in such systems.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for saving planetary systems from such
rapid destruction by their central stars. One of possible universal applicability is
the role of so-called dead zones that occur in disks (Matsumura et al., 2007). Dead
zones are regions that are too poorly ionized to support the kind of hydromagnetic
turbulence in disks that makes them ‘viscous’. Such zones may extend up to 15 AU
or so and are marked by low viscosity. A massive planet that migrates into such a
region will readily open a large gap in the disk. Its radial inward migration is then
locked to the slow rate at which gas in the dead zone drifts inwards.

4.3 Protoplanetary disks and the formation of biomolecules
Well over 100 molecules, many of them organic, have been identiﬁed in interstellar
gas. The clumps and cores in molecular clouds out of which stars form have
densities ranging from 104 cm−3 to 108 cm−3 and low temperatures. In this state,
cold gas chemistry can account for the formation of simple molecules (CO, N2 ,
O2 , C2 H2 , C2 H4 , and HCN). The surfaces of dust grains play host to the formation
of more complex organic molecules, which include nitriles, aldehydes, alcohols,
acids, ethers, ketones, amines, amides, and long-chain hydrocarbons.
For decades, our knowledge of the chemistry in the solar nebula was based
on studies of planetary atmospheres, meteorites, and comets. Current observations
allow us to study directly the chemistry of disks around other stars. This work reveals
that active chemistry occurs near the surface regions of protoplanetary disks. This
chemistry is in disequilibrium and is similar observationally to that found in dense
regions directly exposed to ultraviolet and X-ray irradiation (Bergin et al., 2006).
Chemistry and reaction rates in protoplanetary disks depend on the local gas
density, temperature, and radiation ﬁeld. Disks are not ﬂat but are instead observed
to be ﬂared. Their surfaces, therefore, are exposed to radiation from the central
star. The vertical structure of disks arises from the fact that the pressure gradient
of the gas at any radius and scale height in the disk supports the weight of the
material above it. The force that must be balanced is the vertical component of the
gravitational ﬁeld of the central star (e.g., Dubruelle et al. (2006)).
Self-consistent calculations show that the heating of such ﬂaring disks is due
primarily to the ultraviolet radiation from the central star that is absorbed by dust
grains in such surface layers (Chiang and Goldreich, 1997; D’Alessio et al., 1998).
The dust in the disk envelope then reradiates this energy in the form of infrared and
submillimetre photons – about half of which escape vertically away from the disk,

while the remainder radiate downwards towards the disk midplane. These infrared
photons are then absorbed by the deeper lying dust and ultimately radiate out of
the disk. The gas is heated by collisions with the warm dust and cools by radiating
this energy in the form of molecular vibration–rotation emission lines that can
be observed. This overall process produces a disk that is hottest near the surface
layers and cooler towards the midplane. By balancing all of these heating and
cooling rates, one can determine the local disk temperature distribution and hence
the disk’s SED. The prediction that the temperature should scale as T ∝ r −0.5 is
close to that observed.
The vertical structure of disks at disk radii beyond 100 AU consists of three
layers; the radiation-dominated surface layer or ‘photon-dominated region’ (PDR),
which consists mainly of atomic and ionized species, a molecular layer at greater
depth beyond which most ultraviolet radiation has been absorbed by the grains, and
the cold midplane layer noted above. This midplane region turns out to be so cold
(around 20 K) that most heavy species, such as CO, freeze out on the dust grains.
Figure 4.2 shows a schematic of the disk. It is the molecular layer that is of primary
interest for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.
Observations of molecules so far are still limited by the sensitivity of telescopes
as the emission is so weak. By far, the most abundant molecule is molecular
hydrogen, H2 , but it is generally hard to detect. The most abundant species that
have been observed to date in disks include HCO+ , CN, CS, HCN, H2 CO, and
DCO+ (e.g., Dutrey et al. (1997), van Zadelhoff et al. (2001)). Silicates such as
Mg2 SiO4 (forsterite) have been detected in the hot surface layers of the inner regions
of the disk (r ≤ 1–10 AU). This is important because the shape and strength of
silicate features in disk spectra allow one to track the evolution and growth of
dust grains in disks with time. Ices of H2 O, CO2 , and CO are observed in the outer

regions of the disks, where temperatures drop to less than 100 K. The most abundant
organic molecules observed are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.
Their abundance per H atom is of the order of 10−7 . Up to 50% of carbon may
be locked up in such carbonaceous solids. They are important for disk chemistry
because they absorb ultraviolet radiation and act as potential sites for H2 formation.
Dust grains that are coated with simple icy mantles warm up as they are mixed
and transported to dense, active protostellar regions. This can occur in regions
such as the so-called hot cores that are hosts to massive star formation or the
innermost regions of protoplanetary disks. These regions are particularly rich in
organic molecules. Ultraviolet irradiation, or perhaps X-ray bombardment, then
breaks bonds, and allows reactions that can produce organic molecules. However,
evaporation of these simple dust grain surfaces can drive gas phase production of
organics.
It is now well established that organic molecules of extra terrestrial origin
are found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The best-studied of these is the
Murchison meteorite, in which 8 of the 20 biological amino acids have been found
(Engel and Nagy, 1982). Meteorites also contain many other organic molecules that
are relevant in astrobiology (Sephton, 2002), including lipids that have been shown
to be capable of membrane formation (see Chapter 5). The organic molecules in
meteorites may have originally arisen on dust grains, which were then incorporated
into comets and meteorites. The possibility that dust grains with icy mantles are a
site for amino acid synthesis has been investigated experimentally. Bernstein et al.
(2002) and Munoz-Caro et al. (2002) have shown that amino acids such as glycine,
alanine, and serine may result from the exposure of icy mantles consisting of HCN,
ammonia (NH3 ), and formaldehyde (H2 CO) to ultraviolet radiation.
Alternatively, it has been proposed that amino acids such as glycine and
alanine, and the base adenine can form during the gravitational collapse of a core.
Chakrabarti and Chakrabarti (2000) added reactions that make amino acids (e.g., by
the Strecker process – wherein an aldehyde starting material combines with HCN
in ammonia to form the corresponding aminonitrile, which upon hydrolysis forms
the amino acid) to the existing UMIST database of chemical reactions in molecular
clouds. This created a reaction network involving 421 molecular species. As an
example, they found that the glycine that was formed had a mass fraction of order
10−12 . It peaks at a radius of approximately 100 AU and a time of a million years
after the initiation of the collapse. The astronomical detection of interstellar amino
acids, such as glycine, would strengthen the link between the chemistry of disks
and observed amino acids in meteorites. A spectroscopic survey for amino acids in
clouds and disks will be possible with ALMA.
Organic molecules contained in comets and meteorites are delivered to Earth
when impact events occur, and it is known that impacts were frequent in the

early history of the Solar System. Impacts release huge amounts of energy which
might cause thermal degradation of macromolecules. However, Pierazzo and Chyba
(1999) predicted that molecules such as amino acids can survive such impacts
and that the rate of delivery of biomolecules from space could exceed the rate of
synthesis on Earth.

4.4 Measurements and experiments on amino acid synthesis
The previous section presents the case for synthesis of biomolecules in
protoplanetary disks, but several mechanisms of prebiotic synthesis on Earth have
also been debated for many years. In this section, we show that these results combine
to give a coherent picture of which amino acids were most abundant on the early
Earth. We focus on amino acids because of their fundamental importance in biology
and because they have been detected in a wide range of non-biological contexts
relevant to prebiotic synthesis.
In Table 4.1, each column contains observed amino acid concentrations,
normalized relative to glycine unless otherwise stated. In the following discussion,
column numbers refer to this table. Column M1 is the H2 O extract from the
Murchison meteorite (Engel and Nagy, 1982). Column M2 is the Murray meteorite
(Cronin and Moore, 1971), and column M3 is the interior, hydrolysed sample of
the Yamato meteorite (Shimoyama et al., 1979). Several amino acids that are not
used biologically are found to be as abundant in meteorites as the biological ones
(Kvenvolden et al., 1971). We will not consider non-biological amino acids in
this chapter. However, the question of why certain amino acids came to be used in
proteins and others did not is an important one, and in many cases reasons have been
proposed as to why the non-biological ones were avoided (Weber and Miller, 1981).
Column I1 shows measurements from an experiment simulating the chemistry on
icy grains (Munoz-Caro et al., 2002).
Miller and Urey showed that amino acids could be synthesized by exposure of
a mixture of reducing gases to ultraviolet radiation or electrical discharge. These
experiments were intended to show that synthesis was possible in the atmosphere of
the early Earth, which was presumed to be reducing. Column A1 shows the results
with an atmosphere of CH4 , NH3 , H2 O, and H2 (Miller and Orgel, 1974), and
column A2 shows the results with an atmosphere of CH4 , N2 , H2 O, and traces
of NH3 (Miller and Orgel, 1974). Although yields are lower in non-reducing
atmospheres, column A3 shows an experiment using proton irradiation of an
atmosphere of CO, N2 , and H2 O (Miyakawa et al., 2002), which is not a strongly
reducing mixture.
Another competing theory is that life originated in high-temperature, highpressure environments in the deep sea (Amend and Shock, 1998). Chemical

syntheses of amino acids in hydrothermal conditions have been reported. Column
H1 is from Marshall (1994), and H2 is from Hennet et al. (1992). Each of these
columns gives the number of times that the amino acid was observed in greater
than trace amounts in a large number of experiments. The ﬁnal three columns
are miscellaneous chemical synthesis experiments: S1 is shock synthesis from a
gaseous mixture (Bar-Nun et al., 1970); S2 is synthesis from ammonium cyanide
(Exp. 2 of Lowe et al., 1963); S3 is synthesis from CO, H2 , and NH3 at high
temperature in the presence of catalysts (Yoshino et al., 1971). This column shows
the number of positive identiﬁcations of the amino acid from many experiments.
It is possible that the organic molecules that were present when life began were
synthesized by several different mechanisms. A central issue is to estimate what
fraction originated on Earth and what fraction was brought to Earth after synthesis
in protoplanetary disks (Whittet, 1997). The yields on Earth are dependent on
the mixture of gases in the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is non-reducing, yields
on Earth are low, and delivery of molecules from space is more relevant (Chyba
and Sagan, 1992; Kasting, 1993; Pierazzo and Chyba, 1999). Although there is
now a reasonable consensus that the atmosphere was not strongly reducing, the

importance of synthesis in the atmosphere is maintained by some (Lazcano and
Miller, 1996; Miyakawa et al., 2002), and this type of synthesis still works to some
degree in intermediate atmospheres. Despite this uncertainty, the results in Table
4.1 are surprisingly consistent as regards which amino acids can be synthesized,
even if they are in disagreement about where and how they were formed.
In his studies of the origin of the genetic code, Trifonov (2000, 2004) collected 60
criteria by which the amino acids can be ranked. A consensus order was obtained by
averaging the rankings. This procedure incorporates diverse criteria that are not all
consistent with one another, and some of these must be misleading. Nevertheless,
the consensus order that emerges appears to be a useful one. We shall call the average
ranks derived from genetic code criteria Rcode . In this section we derive our own
ranking, Robs , based only on observed frequencies of amino acids in non-biological
syntheses, i.e., we use non-speculative criteria.
We ranked the amino acids according to each criterion in Table 4.1 separately.
For example, for criterion M2, G is most frequent and is given rank 1. The next
two, D and E, are equally frequent, and are both given rank 2.5. The next three are
A, V, and P, with ranks 4, 5, and 6. All the remaining amino acids are not observed,
and are given an equal bottom rank 13.5 (the average of the numbers between 7
and 20). Robs is the mean of the ranks obtained from the 12 columns.
Several points are worth noting from Table 4.1. G is the most abundant amino
acid in all but column A2, where it is second. A, D, and E are also abundant in
most experiments. The next six (V, S, I, L, P, T) are all found in the Miller–Urey
experiment (A2), at least one of the meteorites, and several of the other cases.
Therefore, there is good evidence for prebiotic synthesis of all the amino acids
down as far as T on the list. The following four (K, F, R, H) are not found in
the Miller experiments or in meteorites and occur only in one or two of the other
chemical synthesis experiments. The remaining amino acids (N, Q, C, Y, M, W)
are not formed in any of the experiments. In our view, the data are not sufﬁcient to
make a deﬁnite distinction between K, F, R, H and N, Q, C, Y, M, W.
4.5 A role for thermodynamics
Thermodynamic arguments can help us to understand what the mixtures of amino
acids available to early organisms may have been like, and why there is considerable
consensus among the experiments considered in the previous section. Table 4.2
lists the amino acids and their properties according to the ranking Robs derived
above. We will refer to the top ten amino acids as ‘early’ and the bottom ten as
‘late’. Early amino acids were easily synthesized by non-biological means and
were, therefore, available for use by early organisms. Late amino acids were not
available in appreciable quantities until organisms evolved a means to synthesize

them. The early–late distinction is relevant in the discussion of the origin of the
genetic code in the following section. Our ranking, Robs , is close to the ranking,
Rcode , taken from Table V of Trifonov (2004). The top three are the same, and nine
amino acids are in the top ten of both orders. We prefer Robs on the grounds that it is
derived directly from experimental observables; however, the conclusions drawn
from both rankings are very similar.
The ranking can be interpreted on thermodynamic grounds. Amend and Shock
(1998) have calculated the free energy of formation of the amino acids from
CO2 , NH+
4 , and H2 in two sets of conditions. Gsurf in Table 4.2 corresponds
to surface seawater conditions (18 ◦ C, 1 atm), and Ghydro corresponds to deepsea hydrothermal conditions (100 ◦ C, 250 atm). Figure 4.3 shows that Robs is closely
related to Gsurf . For the ten early amino acids, there is a strong correlation between
the two (r = 0.96).
The late amino acids have signiﬁcantly higher Gsurf than the early ones.
The means and standard deviations of the groups are 169.3 ± 42.0 and 285.0 ±
94.1 kJ/mol. Table 4.2 also lists the molecular weight (MW) of each amino acid
and the ATP cost, which is the number of ATP molecules that must be expended
to synthesize the amino acids using the biochemical pathways in E. coli bacteria

formation: circles – early amino acids; triangles – late amino acids. The line is the
linear regression for the early amino acids.

(Akashi and Gojobori, 2002). The means and standard deviations of MW for early
and late groups are 116.2 ± 20.6 and 157.3 ± 23.2 Da, and the ﬁgures for ATP cost
are 18.5 ± 6.9 and 36.2 ± 17.3. Thus it is clear that the late group are larger and
more thermodynamically costly.
We have omitted the two sulphur-containing amino acids, Met and Cys, from
Figure 4.3. Several of the experiments in Table 4.1 do not include sulphur in the
reaction mixture, so these amino acids are bound to be absent from the products.
Thus, the value of Robs for Met and Cys is unclear. Nevertheless, Met and Cys are
absent from the meteorites, and are late according to Rcode , so it seems reasonable to
classify them in the late group. Additionally, there are some uncertainties associated
with Met and Cys in the data used in the calculation of Gsurf by Amend and
Shock (1998): the concentration of Cys in seawater was not reported; Met and Val
were not distinguishable, which makes the concentration of Met uncertain; and
the concentration of H2 S was below detection (this affects Gsurf for Met and
Cys but not the other amino acids). The value of Gsurf = 113.22 kJ mol−1 for
Met is puzzling. This is lower than for any of the other late amino acids, and is
particularly surprising as it is lower than the ﬁgure for Cys (Met is a larger molecule
than Cys). For all these reasons it seemed preferable to omit Met and Cys from
this ﬁgure.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

All the formation reactions are endergonic (Gsurf > 0). The amino acids
with the smallest Gsurf should be formed most easily, as they require the
least free energy input. Figure 4.3 demonstrates this. The values of Gsurf
are predictive of what we see in a wide range of meteorite and prebiotic
synthesis experiments. If the mixture of compounds were in equilibrium, then we
would expect the concentrations to depend exponentially on G via the Boltzmann
factor exp(−G/kT ). The ranking procedure linearizes this relationship and makes
the correlation easier to see. The exponential dependence explains why the amino
acids with high G are not seen in experiment: their concentration would be too
low to detect. Observed concentrations also depend on the rates of formation and
not just on equilibrium thermodynamics. The middle-ranking amino acids show
considerable ﬂuctuation between the columns of Table 4.1, being present in some
cases and not others. This may reﬂect differences in rates of synthesis between
different experimental conditions. The ranking procedure averages out these
ﬂuctuations.
The picture becomes less clear when we consider the free energy of formation
under hydrothermal conditions. The central message of Amend and Shock (1998)
is that many of the formation reactions are exergonic (Ghydro < 0) under
hydrothermal conditions, and that even the endergonic ones are less positive than
they are at the surface. They use this to explain why hydrothermal vents might be a
good place for current life, and to support the idea that the ﬁrst organisms might have
been deep-sea chemosynthesizers. However, there is no correlation between rank
and Ghydro , and no signiﬁcant difference in Ghydro between early and late amino
acids. The two experiments designed to simulate hydrothermal systems (H1 and H2)
give results that agree fairly well with the combined ranking from the other data.
The Ghydro values do not seem to agree with the H1 and H2 experiments any
better than they agree with the overall ranking. Although this does not rule out the
possibility of a hydrothermal origin of life, what does appear clear is that the ten
early amino acids identiﬁed by the ranking procedure can be predicted on the basis
of Gsurf and not Ghydro .
4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code
One of our main motivations for discussing prebiotic amino acid formation above
is that we are interested in the origin of the genetic code and protein synthesis. The
previous section gives us a good idea which were the early amino acids available
at the time the genetic code evolved. However, many other types of biomolecules
would have been around as well as amino acids, and life must already have reached
a rather advanced stage before the genetic code and protein synthesis could have
evolved. In this chapter, we will not attempt to discuss the origin of life itself, but

4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code

77

we will present our reasons for believing that an RNA world stage existed in the
early history of life, that the genetic code arose in the context of an RNA world,
and that the mixture of prebiotic amino acids available inﬂuenced the structure of
this code.
Current life is based on DNA and proteins: proteins carry out the majority of
catalytic roles in the cell, and DNA stores the genetic information. Proteins are
made using the information speciﬁed in the DNA sequence (genome) of the cell.
Proteins do not have their own hereditary mechanism. Double-stranded DNA does
have a hereditary mechanism because each strand can act as a template for synthesis
of the complementary strand. In current organisms, DNA synthesis is catalysed by
protein enzymes. Thus, DNA and proteins are mutually dependent, and it is difﬁcult
to see how one could have existed without the other. The RNA world hypothesis was
proposed as a way out of this chicken-and-egg dilemma. The RNA world is a period
thought to have existed in the early stages of life in which RNA molecules carried
out both catalytic and genetic roles. This is supported by the fact that there are many
viruses in which the genome is RNA (although no longer any cellular organisms),
and by the increasing repertoire of catalytic RNAs that are being synthesized by
in vitro selection techniques (Joyce, 2002).
It is thought that when organisms evolved the ability to synthesize speciﬁc
proteins, these proteins took over most of the catalytic roles formerly performed by
RNA. Also DNA took over the role of information storage from RNA at some stage.
Nevertheless, RNA was retained as an intermediate between DNA and proteins:
information in the DNA gene sequence is ﬁrst transcribed into an RNA sequence
and then translated into a protein sequence. There are also a certain number of types
of RNAs with key biochemical roles that occur widely in all domains of life and
that are thought to be relics of the RNA world (Jeffares et al., 1998). Joyce (2002)
likened this situation to a primitive civilization that existed before recorded history
but which left its mark on the modern civilization that followed.
There are still important gaps in our understanding of the RNA world, and it is
not known if complex self-replicating RNAs could have originated de novo. It may
be that there was no single self-replicating RNA, and that life began with a network
of reactions of many molecular components (Shapiro, 2006). These components
could have been RNAs or other types of biomolecules. Nevertheless, we are
persuaded that life on Earth passed through an RNA world stage, even if something
preceded this. Translation is the process by which the sequence information in an
RNA molecule is used to make a speciﬁc protein. Translation depends on RNA
in several ways. Firstly, the messenger RNA contains the sequence information;
secondly, ribosomal RNA is the active component of the ribosome – the complex of
macromolecules that catalyses formation of proteins (Moore and Steitz, 2002); and
thirdly, the transfer RNAs are the ‘adaptors’that make the link between nucleic acids

and amino acids. Therefore, it is likely that translation originated in organisms in
which RNAs played a central role and in which a mechanism of accurate replication
of relatively long RNA sequences had already evolved.
The key to translation is the genetic code. This is the set of assignments between
the 64 possible codons (three-letter sequences composed of U, C, A, and G
nucleotides) in RNA and the 20 possible amino acids in proteins. The genetic
code is decoded by complementary base pairing between the codon sequence in
the messenger RNA and the anticodon sequence on the transfer RNAs (readers
requiring more information should consult any biology textbook). The canonical
genetic code shown in Table 4.3 is shared by the three domains of life (archaea,
bacteria, and eukaryotes). Therefore, it evolved prior to the last universal common
ancestor (LUCA). Understanding how it arose is a fundamental question in
evolutionary biology.
As prebiotic synthesis of the early group of amino acids seems to be possible in
a number of environments, it is likely that these early amino acids were available
to RNA-based organisms. Prior to the evolution of the genetic code, amino acids
could have played a role in metabolism, and it is possible that polypeptides might
also have been synthesized if peptide bond formation was catalysed by a ribozyme.

4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code

79

For more details of possible types of chemistry that could have existed in this
period, see Pascal et al. (2005). However, before the genetic code evolved, any
peptides would have had stochastic amino acid compositions. When the genetic
code arose, it became possible to synthesize speciﬁc proteins where the amino acid
sequence was predetermined by the RNA sequence. Speciﬁc proteins can have
speciﬁc structures and hence speciﬁc functions; therefore, they are much more
useful to an organism than are stochastic peptides. The invention of the genetic
code is a stroke of evolutionary brilliance which couples the hereditary mechanism
inherent in the template-directed replication of nucleic acids to the catalytic
possibilities of proteins. Prior to the genetic code, proteins could not undergo
evolution.
Early versions of the code probably used a smaller repertoire of amino acids, each
with a larger number of codons. The codon table was divided up into progressively
smaller blocks as successive amino acids were added. This idea goes as far back
as Crick (1968). Each addition would have opened up a whole new world of
protein possibilities. Thus, there is a selective drive for adding new amino acids
in the early stages of code development. This brings us back to question of the
order of addition of amino acids to the genetic code. We have shown above that
the early group of amino acids can be identiﬁed based on their appearance in
meteorites, the Miller–Urey experiment, and a variety of other chemical syntheses
designed to simulate prebiotic conditions. The strong correlation between the
ranking, Robs , that we derive and the free energy of formation, Gsurf , suggests
that this ranking is a meaningful prediction of the relative frequencies of abiotically
synthesized amino acids that would have been available to the ﬁrst organisms.
Essentially the same amino acids are placed early in Rcode (Trifonov, 2004)
as well.
We therefore envisage an organism in the RNA world that learned to use the
available amino acids to synthesize proteins in a prescribed way and found this
to be extremely useful. Such an organism would have begun to evolve metabolic
pathways to synthesize these amino acids itself from other chemicals so that it
was no longer reliant on the prebiotic supply. As this process proceeded, pathways
developed for synthesis of the more complex, late group of amino acids that were
never present in appreciable quantities prebiotically. At some point along the line,
proteins became so useful and so essential that the RNA-based organisms were
replaced by modern DNA/protein-based organisms. This scenario has long been
advocated by Wong (1975) as part of what is known as the coevolution theory for the
origin of the code. In an updated version of this theory, Wong (2005) proposed the
same set of early and late amino acids as us, based on synthesis from atmospheric
gases. We have shown above that this set of early amino acids seems likely, even
if the place of origin is different.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

4.7 How was the genetic code optimized?
There is considerable evidence that the canonical code has evolved to minimize the
effect of errors (Freeland et al., 2003). Mutations create errors in the gene sequence
that are passed to the protein sequences translated from this gene. Translational
errors due to codon–anticodon mispairing or mischarging of a tRNA will introduce
occasional non-heritable errors into proteins. These errors are likely to involve only
one of the three bases in the codon most of the time. Errors can be minimized by
arranging for codons that differ by only one base to code for the same amino acid or
amino acids with similar physical properties. Thus, when an error leads to an amino
acid replacement, it is usually replaced by a similar amino acid, and the deleterious
effect on the protein is minimized. The canonical code has been compared with
large numbers of random codes created by reshufﬂing the amino acid positions in
the table of codons. The fraction of random codes for which the average effect
of an error is less than in the canonical code is as small as 10−6 (Freeland and
Hurst, 1998), and can be even smaller than this if the effect of unequal amino acid
frequencies is also accounted for (Gilis et al., 2001).
It was originally thought that the canonical code was shared by all organisms
and that it was frozen and unable to change. However, although the majority of
organisms use the canonical code, there are now a large number of cases known
where small changes to the code have occurred in speciﬁc lineages (Knight et al.,
2001). There are several different mechanisms by which codon reassignment can
occur despite the negative selective effects that are present during the changeover
period (Sengupta and Higgs, 2005, Sengupta et al., 2007). The variant codes have
all arisen since the establishment of the canonical code. In this chapter, we are more
concerned with the origin of the canonical code itself.
One remarkable pattern in the code is that the ﬁve highest ranking amino acids,
Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, and Val, all have codons of the form GNN (codons with ﬁrst
position G are on the bottom row of Table 4.3). It is possible that only these GNN
codons were assigned in the ﬁrst code. Trifonov (1987) argued that the ﬁrst position
G is important for maintaining the correct reading frame during translation. Eigen
and Winkler-Oswatitsch (1981) proposed an initial code with only the four GNC
codons assigned (one codon each for Gly, Ala, Asp, and Val). However, such a
system has the disadvantage that a large fraction of codons are unassigned, and that
most mutations in a gene sequence would create untranslatable codons. It would
be advantageous to rapidly progress to a stage where all codons were assigned,
as this reduces the mutational load. A possibility that we consider likely is that
there was a stage in which the code was divided simply into four columns: all
NUN codons were Val, all NCN codons were Ala, all NAN codons were Asp (or a
mixture of Asp and Glu), and all NGN codons were Gly. In this pattern, there is still

4.7 How was the genetic code optimized?

a shift of three bases between successive codons, but only the second position base
carries information. This means that the code can become more speciﬁc later by
assigning signiﬁcance to ﬁrst and third positions without destroying the information
contained at the second position (Crick, 1968). Later, preﬁx and sufﬁx codons may
have arisen (Wu et al., 2005), where either the ﬁrst and second or the second and
third bases were signiﬁcant. This would have broken up the four columns into
smaller divisions.
This proposal is consistent with the observation that the code is error-minimizing.
Selection would have acted to ensure each new amino acid was added in a favourable
position. This would mean that amino acids would be added into positions that used
to be occupied by an earlier amino acid with similar properties. Work by H. Goodarzi
(personal communication) also makes this point. In the ﬁrst column Phe, Leu, Ile,
and Met are similar to Val, and in the second column Ser, Pro, and Thr are similar
to Ala. A general property of the code is that amino acids in the same column are
much more similar than those in the same row (Urbina et al., 2006). This may be a
relic of an early four-column stage of the code where all codons in the same column
coded for the same amino acid.
Wong (1975, 2005) also supposes that large blocks of codons were divided up
into smaller ones as new amino acids were added to the code; however, there are
important differences to our argument above. From the pathways of biosynthesis of
amino acids in modern organisms, it is possible to deﬁne precursor–product pairs.
Wong argues that later amino acids were assigned to codons that were formerly
occupied by their biochemical precursors. The earliest code would have contained
only the amino acids that are at the start of the biochemical pathways. Di Giulio
and Medugno (1999) showed the complex pattern of assignments that would have
existed in the early code if every current amino acid were replaced by its earliest
precursor. This pattern seems unlikely to us because it would require a very complex
molecular recognition process for tRNA charging. The initial four-column pattern
that we propose would require straightforward molecular recognition of the second
base in the anticodon. The precursor–product argument predicts that precursor–
product pairs in the canonical code should occupy neighbouring codons. The
statistical signiﬁcance of this depends on the details of how precursor–product
pairs are counted (Ronneberg et al., 2000) and is not as high as was previously
claimed. Our argument is that later amino acids were added to positions that were
formerly occupied by amino acids with similar properties, irrespective of whether
the earlier amino acid was a precursor of the later. This predicts that amino acids
on neighbouring codons should have similar properties, i.e., the code should be
optimized in the sense of Freeland and Hurst (1998). The statistical evidence for
this is much more robust, as discussed above.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

In contrast to both these theories, it has also been proposed that there were speciﬁc
interactions between amino acids and their codons or anticodons. Evidence for this
comes from selection experiments on random RNA pools (Yarus et al., 2005).
Although this is intriguing, to us it is the error-minimizing properties of the code
that most demand an explanation. An error-minimizing code can be reached by
a pathway in which natural selection acts each time a new amino acid is added.
Precursor–product relationships and RNA–amino acid interactions might inﬂuence
which codons were most likely to be ‘tried out’ for a new amino acid, but selection
would eliminate those trial codes in which an amino acid was added in ‘the wrong
place’, and would favour the addition of a new amino acid in a place that was
consistent with its physical properties. Thus our principle for amino acid addition
explains how the code became optimized.

4.8 Protein evolution
The previous section envisages early proteins composed of a small set of amino
acids. Several studies have considered whether such proteins could be functional.
Using only three amino acids (Gln, Leu, and Arg), proteins with strong helical
structure were found (Davidson et al., 1995). Doi et al. (2005) found that random
sequences of the ﬁve most abundant early amino acids according to our ranking,
Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, and Val, were more soluble than random sequences of 20 amino
acids or Gln–Leu–Arg proteins. Riddle et al. (1997) took a 57-residue structural
domain of a naturally occurring protein and found that almost all residues could be
replaced by an amino acid from a simple alphabet of Ile–Lys–Glu–Ala–Gly. The
smallest amino acids, Gly and Ala, were essential parts of this alphabet. The large
aromatic amino acids, Trp, Phe, and Tyr, which are late according to our theory,
were not able to be replaced by amino acids from the simple alphabet. Babajide
et al. (1997) used inverse-folding programmes to locate sequences that are likely to
fold to a speciﬁed natural protein structure. Suitable sequences could be found for
some very small alphabets (including Ala–Asp–Leu–Gly, which is very similar to
our proposed original set) but not others (including Gln–Leu–Arg). Taken together,
these studies suggest that proteins composed of the early group of amino acids
could well have formed similar structures to modern day proteins and could have
performed useful functions in early organisms.
Another unusual proposal that is worth mentioning is the proteins-ﬁrst hypothesis
of Ikehara (2005). The same amino acids are again ﬁrst in this theory, but proteins
composed of Gly–Ala–Asp–Val evolve replication and metabolism prior to the
origin of RNA. It is not clear to us how genetic information could be passed on by
proteins alone, however.

4.8 Protein evolution

83

We considered above the role that thermodynamics has in prebiotic synthesis
of amino acids. It also seems likely that thermodynamics effects the evolution of
modern proteins. Akashi and Gojobori (2002) showed that organisms appear to be
sensitive to the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis (listed in Table 4.2). Speciﬁcally,
the most highly expressed proteins had the highest frequency of the low-cost amino
acids. Seligmann (2003) also found considerable evidence that amino acid usage
in proteins is affected by cost minimization. Gutierrez et al. (1996) observed an
increase in frequency of the base G in the ﬁrst codon position in highly expressed
genes, which can be interpreted as selection for low-cost amino acids Gly–Ala–
Asp–Glu–Val.
It is possible that modern day proteins may still contain a signal of which amino
acids were abundant in the early stages of evolution. Phylogenetic methods can
be used to reconstruct estimates of ancestral sequences and hence to determine
the frequencies of amino acids in those sequences. Brooks et al. (2002) estimated
frequencies of amino acids in the LUCA, and found them to be noticeably different
from current proteins. In Table 4.2, p = pLUCA −pcurrent . Jordan et al. (2005) used
a method that involved comparing sequences from triplets of related species. The
earliest diverging species in each triplet can be used to give a direction to the amino
acid substitutions occurring on the branches leading to the other two species. It is
found that forward and backward substitution rates between pairs of amino acids
are not equal, and that amino acids frequencies show an increasing or decreasing
trend. dp/dt is the estimate of the rate of change of the amino acid frequencies.
There are some limited points of agreement between dp/dt and p. The most
rapidly decreasing amino acid is Ala in both cases, and the three most frequent
early amino acids, Gly, Ala, and Asp, are all decreasing. Beyond that, there is little
agreement: only seven amino acids have the same sign in both studies. We would
expect early amino acids to be decreasing and late amino acids to be increasing.
Thirteen amino acids have the right sign according to p, and 14 have the right
sign according to dp/dt. This is suggestive but not fully convincing. McDonald
(2006) has cast doubt on the Jordan et al. (2005) study on methodological grounds,
and a second study of Brooks et al. (2004) produced results that differ from their
previous study (Brooks et al., 2002) as to which amino acids are increasing and
which decreasing. Our position is that trends in amino acid frequencies like this
would have occurred over time and it makes sense to look for them. However, it
is a long time since the LUCA and it may not be possible to see convincing trends
above the noise.
One observation of Brooks et al. (2004) is relevant to the extremophile theme
of this book. They found that the estimated frequencies of amino acids in the
LUCA were closer to those of hyperthermophiles than mesophiles, which might

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

suggest that LUCA was a hyperthermophile. It has also been argued that the genetic
code was established at high temperature (Di Giulio, 2000) and high pressure
(Di Giulio, 2005) based on comparison of amino acid frequencies in extremophiles
and mesophiles. The hyperthermophile nature of LUCA is still controversial, and
some cold water is poured on this idea in Chapter 8.

4.9 Summary
In this chapter, we have done our best to combine information from astrophysics,
organic chemistry, molecular evolution, and bioinformatics. It became apparent to
us that the strands of knowledge that link these diverse disciplines are becoming
ever stronger and, indeed, are required to understand how life may have arisen
in our Solar System and perhaps in others. The generality of planet formation
and the universality of the organic chemistry (that is just starting to be explored)
in protoplanetary disks is very encouraging. It suggests that the astrophysics of
protoplanetary disks could play a major role in understanding how one goes from
dust and gas to watery worlds equipped with the biomolecules that may have served
as the ﬁrst building blocks of life. Beyond this, we have also shown that the
abundance and distribution of early amino acids may have played an important
role in the origin of the earliest genetic code and how it may have subsequently
evolved.
