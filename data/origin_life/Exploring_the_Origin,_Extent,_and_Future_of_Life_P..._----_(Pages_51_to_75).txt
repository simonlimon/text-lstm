Emergence and the experimental pursuit of the origin of life

world scenario provides an intriguing third option, though one totally unsupported
by experimental evidence.
Consequently, the favored genetics origin model is based on a nucleic acid molecule like RNA – a polymer that acted both as a carrier of information and as a
catalyst that promoted  self-replication [104, 105, 106]. This idea received a boost
in the early 1980s with the discovery of ribozymes – genetic material that also
acts as a catalyst [107, 108, 109]. Modern life relies on two complexly intertwined
molecules,  DNA to carry information and  proteins to perform chemical functions.
This interdependence leads to the chicken–egg dilemma:  proteins make and maintain DNA, but DNA carries the instructions to make proteins. Which came first?
RNA, it turns out, has the potential to do both jobs .
The “RNA world” theory that quickly emerged champions the central role of
genetic material in the dual tasks of catalyst and information transfer [110, 111,
112]. Over the years “RNA world” has come to mean different things to different people, but three precepts are common to all versions: (1) once upon a time
RNA carried genetic information, (2) RNA replication followed the same rules as
modern DNA, by matching pairs of bases such as A-T and C-G, and (3)  proteins
were not involved in the process. The first life form in this scenario was simply a
self-replicating strand of RNA, perhaps enclosed in a protective lipid membrane.
According to most versions of this hypothesis,  metabolism emerged later as a
means to make the RNA replication process more efficient.
The RNA world model is not without its difficulties. Foremost among these
problems is the exceptional difficulty in the prebiotic synthesis of RNA [25, 111,
112, 113]. Many of the presumed proto-metabolic molecules are easily synthesized
in experiments that mimic prebiotic environments. RNA nucleotides, by contrast,
have never been synthesized from scratch. Furthermore, even if a prebiotic synthetic pathway to nucleotides could be found, a plausible mechanism to link those
nucleotides into an RNA strand has not been demonstrated. It is not obvious how
useful  catalytic RNA sequences would have formed spontaneously in any prebiotic
environment. Perhaps, some scientists speculate, a simpler nucleic acid preceded
RNA [7, 114, 115, 116].
Whatever the scenario – metabolism first or genetics first, on the ocean’s surface
or at a deep ocean vent – the origin of life required more than the replication of
chemicals. For a chemical system to be alive, it must display evolution by the process of natural selection.
2.5  The emergence of  natural selection
Molecular selection, the process by which a few key molecules earned key roles in
life’s origin, proceeded on many fronts. Some molecules were inherently unstable

or highly reactive and so they quickly disappeared from the scene. Other molecules easily dissolved in the oceans and so were effectively removed from contention. Still other molecular species may have sequestered themselves by bonding
strongly to surfaces of chemically unhelpful minerals or clumped together into
gooey masses of little use to emerging biology.
In every geochemical environment, each kind of organic molecule had its reliable sources and its inevitable sinks. For a time, perhaps for hundreds of millions
of years, a kind of molecular equilibrium was maintained as the new supply of each
species was balanced by its loss. Such an equilibrium features non-stop competition among molecules, to be sure, but the system does not evolve.
The first self-replicating molecules changed that equilibrium. Even a relatively unstable collection of molecules can be present in significant concentration if it learns how to make copies of itself. The first successful metabolic cycle
of molecules, for example, would have proven vastly superior to its individual
chemical neighbors at accumulating atoms and harnessing energy. But success
breeds competition. Inevitable slight variations in the self-replicating cycle, triggered by the introduction of new molecular species or by differences in environment, initiated an era of increased competition. More efficient cycles flourished
at the expense of the less efficient. Evolution by natural selection had begun on
Earth.
The simplest self-replicating molecular systems are not alive. Given all the time
in the world such systems won’t evolve. A more interesting possibility is an environment in which two or more self-replicating suites of molecules compete. These
dueling molecular networks vie for resources, mimicking life’s unceasing struggle
for survival. A stable system without competition, by contrast, has no incentive to
evolve.
Two common processes – variation and selection – provide a powerful mechanism for self-replicating systems to evolve. For a system to evolve it must first display
a range of variations. Natural systems display random variations through mutations,
which are undirected changes in the chemical makeup of key biomolecules. Most
variations harm the organism and are doomed to failure. Once in a while, however,
a random mutation leads to an improved trait – a more efficient metabolism, better
camouflage, swifter locomotion, or greater tolerance for extreme environmental
conditions. Such beneficial variations are more likely to survive in the competitive
natural world – such variations fuel the process of natural selection.
Competition drives the emergence of natural selection . Such behavior appears to
be inevitable in any self-replicating chemical system in which resources are limited
and some molecules have the ability to mutate. Over time, more efficient networks
of autocatalytic molecules will increase in concentration at the expense of less efficient networks. In such a competitive milieu the emergence of increasing molecular

complexity is inevitable; new chemical pathways overlay the old. So it is that life
has continued to evolve over the past four billion years of Earth history.

2.5.1  Molecular evolution in the lab
Laboratory studies of molecular evolution have led to methods for the artificial
evolution of molecules that accomplish specific chemical tasks. Harvard biologist
Jack Szostak, for example, has explored this approach in attempts to design an
evolving synthetic laboratory life form [117]. Szostak focuses on devising chains of
RNA that perform one key task such as copying other RNA molecules [118].
Szostak and co-workers [119, 120, 121, 122] tackle RNA evolution by first generating a collection of trillions of random RNA sequences, each about 120 nucleo­
tides (RNA “letters”) long. The vast majority of these chains do nothing, but a few
are able to perform a specific task, for example grabbing onto another molecule
that has been attached to the sides of a glass beaker. Flushing out the beaker with
water removes all of the unattached RNA strands and thus selects and concentrates
RNA sequences bonded to the target. These select strands are then copied with
a controlled rate of mutational errors to produce a new batch of trillions of RNA
sequences, some of which are even better suited to attach to the beaker’s sides.
Repeating this process improves the speed and accuracy with which the RNA
latches onto the target molecules.
An enticing target of molecular evolution research is self-replicating RNA – a
big molecule that carries genetic information, catalyzes its own reproduction, and
mutates and evolves as well. But no plausible geochemical environment could
have fed such an unbound molecule, nor would it have survived long under most
natural chemical conditions. Szostak’s group ultimately hopes to encapsulate such
a replicative RNA strand in a lipid vesicle to synthesize a self-replicating cell-like
entity [117].
The synthesis of an “RNA organism” would provide a degree of credibility to
the RNA world hypothesis, that a strand of RNA  (or some chemically more stable
precursor genetic molecule) formed the basis of the first evolving, self-replicating
chemical system. But lab life will not have emerged spontaneously from chemical
reactions among the simple molecular building blocks of the prebiotic Earth, nor
would such an object be capable of reproduction without a steady supply of laboratory chemicals. Deep mysteries will remain.
2.6  Three scenarios for the origin of life
What do we know so far? Abundant organic molecules must have been synthesized
and accumulated in a host of productive prebiotic environments. Subsequently,

biomolecular systems including lipid membranes and genetic polymers might have
formed through self-organization and by selection on mineral surfaces. As molecular complexity increased, it seems plausible that simple metabolic cycles of selfreplicating molecules emerged, as did self-replicating genetic molecules.
The greatest gap in understanding life’s origin lies in the transition from a moreor-less static geochemical world with an abundance of interesting organic molecules, to an evolving biochemical world. How that transition occurred may be
reduced to a choice among three possible scenarios [7]:
1. Life began with  metabolism and genetic molecules were incorporated later. Following
Günter Wächtershäuser’s hypothesis, life began autotrophically. Life’s first building
blocks were the simplest of molecules, while minerals provided chemical energy. In this
scenario a self-replicating chemical cycle akin to the reverse citric acid cycle became
established on a mineral surface. All subsequent chemical complexities, including genetic mechanisms and encapsulation into a cell-like structure, arose through  natural
selection as variants of the cycle competed for resources and the system became more
efficient. In this scenario, life first emerged as an evolving chemical coating on rocks.
2. Life began with self-replicating genetic molecules and  metabolism was incorporated
later. Following the RNA world hypothesis, life began heterotrophically. Organic
molecules in the prebiotic soup, perhaps aided by clays or some other template, selforganized into information-rich polymers. Eventually, one of these polymers, perhaps
surrounded by a lipid membrane, acquired the ability to self-replicate. All subsequent
chemical complexities, including metabolic cycles, arose through  natural selection as
variants of the genetic polymer became more efficient at  self-replication. In this scenario, life emerged as an evolving polymer with a functional genetic sequence.
3. Life began as a cooperative chemical phenomenon between  metabolism and genetics.
A third possible scenario rests on the possibility that neither primitive metabolic cycles
(which lack the means of faithful self-replication) nor primitive genetic molecules (which
are not very stable and lack a reliable source of chemical energy) could have progressed far
by themselves. If, however, a crudely self-replicating genetic molecule became attached
to a crudely functioning surface-bound metabolic coating, then a kind of cooperative
chemistry might have kicked in. The genetic molecule might have used chemical energy
produced by metabolites to make copies of itself, while protecting itself by binding to
the surface. Any subsequent variations of the genetic molecule that fortuitously offered
protection for itself or for the metabolites, or improved the chemical efficiency of the system, would have been preserved preferentially. Gradually, both the genetic and metabolic
components would have become more efficient and more interdependent.

Scientists do not yet know the answer, but they are poised to find out. Whatever
the process, ultimately competition began to drive the emergence of ever more elaborate chemical cycles by the process of  natural selection. Inexorably, life emerged,
never to relinquish its foothold on Earth .

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson:
changing  definitions of life viewed
in a historical context
James E. Strick

3.1  Introduction
 The origin of life has always been a topic charged with religious import. This
chapter aims to survey briefly some origin-of-life ideas over time; first, if we look
in detail at how the debate over life’s origin played out between  Darwin and his supporters, we will see a clear example of this. Note that I said Darwin’s supporters,
rather than his opponents. We expect a story about the new evolutionary science to
include much heated objection from religious groups, for whom so many aspects
of Darwin’s theory produced problems. But a look at how divisive the issue was
among the Darwinians themselves is an even more complex and enlightening
story, perhaps of more relevance to scientists in their own work.
By the 1850s,  William Benjamin Carpenter, Professor of physiology at the Royal
Institution of London, believed, as did  Herbert Spencer, that the vital force of living things was completely interconvertible with forces from non-living nature such
as heat, electricity, kinetic energy, etc. However, also like Spencer and a number
of others in the Darwinian camp, Carpenter believed that the conversion of heat or
chemical energy into vital energy could only be accomplished through the agency
of already living matter; in other words, that non-living matter could never organize
itself into living matter capable of generating vital force [1]. This served as a convenient theoretical barrier separating modern physiology and its ally, the new evolution theory, from the bête noir of spontaneous generation. (Spontaneous generation
meant life arising directly from non-living matter; the idea had become associated
through Buffon,  Lamarck, and others with the politics of revolutionary France. In
Britain the most prominent spontaneous generation advocate was Charles Darwin’s
early mentor, the Lamarckian  Robert Grant, also a supporter of radical political
reforms.) Carpenter’s spin on how, despite the conservation of energy principle,

there was still a qualitative difference between vital and non-living forces, did
keep the politically unsavory doctrine of spontaneous generation at arm’s length
from the new professional scientists among whom Darwin was a leader. However,
it simultaneously posed a new conundrum for the emerging life sciences centered
around  Darwinism: it seemed to prove an absolute, uncrossable divide between the
living and non-living worlds, leaving no alternative but a supernatural explanation
for the first  origin of life on Earth.
That suited Carpenter,  a very religious man, just fine; but others were worried
about the contradiction. Many younger supporters of Darwin’s theory were enthusiastic about its charter of seeming to banish supernatural explanations from life
sciences and of establishing new proof for the unbroken continuity of nature. These
included  T. H. Huxley and his protégés, the next generation of rising Darwinian talent, prominent among them the physician and medical researcher  Henry Charlton
Bastian. Bastian was deeply interested in the problem of consciousness; and Bastian,
more than any of the other young Darwinians, became fascinated with the origin of
life itself and convinced that the question could be approached by experiment in a
laboratory. While some Darwinians imagined even the simplest cells must require
a long, gradual process of formation, Bastian described experiments that he thought
showed cells emerging very rapidly, in a few days, from non-living starting materials.
In hermetically sealed containers, Bastian boiled infusions of different materials, both
organic and inorganic, then observed the cooled contents microscopically and saw a
profusion of different living microorganisms. At this time many observers  thought
the term “spontaneous generation” to automatically imply such rapid formation. By
1870 he claimed experimental proof for spontaneous generation and argued this was
important support for the Darwinian theory.1
Those liberal-minded Christians who sought some kind of accommodation
between the new evolutionary science and their religious beliefs were an audience
of great interest to Darwin. Hence, in On the Origin of Species [2], Darwin went
out of his way, even misrepresenting his own views on life’s origin, to use language
that gave those readers some breathing room. He devoted only one sentence in the
entire book to  the origin of life, and there he said:
… I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived
on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first
breathed (p. 484).

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson

Many of Darwin’s friends criticized him for this dissembling, as did Richard Owen
while touting an alternative evolution theory to Darwin’s. In private Darwin repeatedly regretted having weakened the clarity of his position by using such Biblical
language. As he put it, with sarcasm toward Owen’s spontaneous generation concept, which likened snot to protoplasm:

Copyright © 2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

It will be some time before we see “slime, snot, or protoplasm” … generating a new animal.
But I have long regretted that I truckled to public opinion, and used the Pentateuchal term
of creation, by which I really meant “appeared” by some wholly unknown process. It is
mere rubbish, thinking at present of the  origin of life; one might as well think of the origin
of matter [3].2

But clearly Darwin felt that, at least in the short run, it was unwise to alienate so
large a pool of potential allies during the early years of controversy over his theory.
An indicator that Darwin agrees with the criticism of his friends is that he dropped
the entire phrase “into which life was first breathed by the Creator” from the third
edition of Origin, which appeared in April 1861. But, tellingly, Darwin did not
insert in its place a more forthright explanation of the kind he had given in private.
He simply left out any comment on the matter of how that “one primordial form”
had arisen. And despite much private speculation, he never made any further public
comment on the topic to his dying day in 1882. He left the passage untouched in all
remaining editions of the book (the last revision was the sixth edition of 1872).
I have demonstrated elsewhere that  Bastian’s experiments on the possibility of
spontaneous generation were widely seen in the 1870s as relevant to much broader,
socially charged questions such as the nature of consciousness; the interchangeability
of “vital force,” and especially “nerve force,” with other physical and chemical forces
in nature; the mechanism of heredity, and of memory generally; cell theory; and the
origin of diseases, both contagious and degenerative [4].3 Clearly, a lot was at stake,
and some of it, most deeply of all, was inseparably tied to whether there was any need
at all for a Creator God. To those who opposed  Darwinian evolution on religious
grounds, it was obvious that Darwin and  Huxley implied a naturalistic  origin of life,
just as it was obvious to Bastian and his supporters [5, 64]. But for religious critics of
evolution this meant an even more important reason to oppose  Darwinism.
Thus, in 1870 when Bastian  began to publicly press the implications of
Darwinism for a materialistic origin of life, he created great difficulty for many of

those liberal Christians who had, up until that point, felt they could enthusiastically
support Darwin.5 In one public venue  Frederick Barnard, president of Columbia
University, wrote that he found  Bastian’s Beginnings of Life so convincing, that
educated Christians must now feel forced to choose between Darwinism and a universe with no Creator God.6 Surely Barnard was not the only such person, but his
remarkable frankness bears quoting at some length, to show just why Darwin and
 Huxley tried to avoid pushing the issue as forcefully as Bastian. Barnard said: 
We are told, indeed, that the acceptance of these views need not shake our faith in the
existence of an Almighty Creator. It is beautifully explained to us how they ought to give
us more elevated and more worthy conceptions of the modes by which He works His
will in the visible creation. We learn that our complex organisms are none the less the
work of His hands because they have been evolved by an infinite series of changes from
microscopic gemmules, and that these gemmules themselves have taken on their forms
under the influence of the physical forces of light and heat and attraction acting on brute
mineral matter. Rather it should seem we are a good deal more so. This kind of teaching
is heard in our day even from the theologians. … It is indeed a grand conception which
regards the Deity as conducting the work of His creation by means of those all-pervading
influences which we call the forces of nature; but it leaves us profoundly at a loss to
explain the wisdom or the benevolence which brings every day into life such myriads of
sentient and intelligent beings, only that they may perish on the morrow of their birth.
But this is not all. If these doctrines are true, all talk of creation or methods of creation
becomes absurdity; for just as certainly as they are true, God himself is impossible. … 
But we are told it is unphilosophical, in the pursuit of truth, to concern ourselves about
consequences. … To this canon I am willing to subscribe up to a certain point. But if, in
my study of nature, I find the belief forced upon me that my own conscious spirit … is but
a mere vapor, which appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away forever, that is a
truth … for which I shall never thank the science which has taught it me. Much as I love
truth in the abstract, I love my hope of immortality still more; and if the final outcome
of all the boasted discoveries of modern science is to disclose to men that they are more
evanescent than the shadow of the swallow’s wing upon the lake, … give me then, I pray,
no more science. Let me live on, in my simple ignorance, as my fathers lived before me,
and when I shall at length be summoned to my final repose, let me still be able to fold the
drapery of my couch about me, and lie down to pleasant, even though they be deceitful
dreams  [7].7

Spontaneous generation seemed to bring home to many evolutionists the stark
materialist implications of what  Huxley had called “the physical basis of life.”

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson

51

Among the younger Darwinians,  Alfred Russel Wallace came out early and
very strongly in favor of Bastian’s arguments, in one of the first reviews to appear
of  The Beginnings of Life [8]. The medical journals also applauded the strengthening of  Darwinism by Bastian’s experiments, emphasizing that he extended the logical “continuity in nature” so important to the new scientific  naturalism, bridging
the arbitrary gap between living and non-living matter.
At this,  Huxley and his colleague, physicist  John Tyndall, began to campaign
more vigorously for a unified front among Darwin supporters. They thought  Bastian
must be a careless experimenter (though on many of the most important points they
were wrong); thus they adopted a strategy of severing the linkage between evolution and present-day spontaneous generation, and they declared Bastian and all his
supporters, de facto,  “non-Darwinians.” Huxley in his famous BAAS address [9],
 “Biogenesis and Abiogenesis,” first publicly declared that Darwinian science did
indeed imply a naturalistic origin of life; he called this  “abiogenesis” to make clear
that it differed from spontaneous generation in that it could only have occurred
in the Earth’s distant past.8 It is from this time that  Darwin wrote privately to
Hooker:

Copyright © 2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of living organisms are now
present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh what a big if) one could conceive in some warm little pond with the right amounts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, –
light, heat, electricity, etc. present, thus a protein compound was chemically formed, ready
to undergo itself such complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly
devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures had
formed [10].

Clearly, Darwin’s private views were highly sympathetic to a naturalistic  origin of
life, at least on the primitive Earth. And he continued to follow the debates between
Bastian and Huxley with great interest. But he certainly never judged it appropriate
to make his own views public, even when Bastian’s career was nearly ruined by
Huxley’s campaign to undermine his scientific reputation. The reaction of  Barnard
and others like him can only have confirmed for Darwin how important his original choice had been to keep silent, or even at first throw a bone to Christians on the
origin-of-life issue. Thus until at least the 1870s, the scientists themselves stepped
very carefully around religious implications of their work. 
 William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) produced his theory of meteoritic import
of life to Earth in his 1871 Presidential Address to the BAAS as a clear rebuttal to
  Huxley, ironically, hijacked  Bastian’s own term “biogenesis” without attribution and gave it the opposite
meaning, i.e. life only from already existing life. Huxley’s rhetorical success in making his terms stick (and
thereby distancing proper evolutionary science from the older doctrine of “spontaneous generation” and its
unsavory associations, was no small part of his ability to vanquish Bastian. So much so that most textbooks
today include “biogenesis” among terms Huxley is credited with coining.

Huxley’s position on abiogenesis from 1870 [11]. Thomson was a deeply religious
man and a committed opponent of Darwinism. Not surprisingly, in their personal
correspondence the Darwinians made fun of Thomson’s recourse to such an unscientific hypothesis. From their point of view, he was abandoning his usual scientific
critical faculties because he was so desperate to find a way to avoid the implication
of abiogenesis.  In this early incarnation, Huxley  thought Thomson’s  version of
 “panspermia” merely pushed the problem back to another planet but was no real
solution to the origin-of-life question.9
As  I ris Fry has pointed out, the Pope, even in his 1997 statement declaring that
evolution was supported by enough facts that it was now “more than a hypothesis,” still made it clear that he was not ready to accept a theory of evolution
based on a materialist interpretation, but only one that was spiritualist in its
philosophy (i.e. one that acknowledges that if a human body takes its form from
pre-existing living matter, the soul was immediately created by God). Fry’s book
 T he Emergence of Life on Earth [12] offers an excellent summary of how varied
Christian theological positions could be over time, however. Early Church doctrine was dominated for hundreds of years by the thinking of  St. Augustine, for
example. Quoting Fry,
According to Augustine, continuing spontaneous generation is made possible by a divine
decree, issued at the moment of creation and active forevermore, under whose power
the generation of living creatures from the earth and various organic materials persists.
Augustine referred to biblical commands such as “Let the land produce vegetation,” “Let
the water teem with living creatures,” and “Let the land produce living creatures according
to their kinds.” At the first event of creation, he said, God formed the “seed-principles” of
all the species, which are the potentials of all living creatures to come. These potentials
materialize throughout the history of the Earth according to a preordained plan, in both
sexual and spontaneous generation, when the circumstances are favorable [12] (p. 18).

Fry  points out that, even when Thomas Aquinas modified this doctrine by
­combining Augustine’s “seed-principles” with Aristotelian philosophy, arguing for
much more active, direct intervention by God, still, under both Augustine’s and
Aquinas’s doctrines
and for centuries thereafter, no doubt was raised as to the possibility of spontaneous generation. This harmony between the belief in spontaneous generation and various Christian
doctrines is noteworthy, especially since it tends to be forgotten following the radical
change in the church’s attitude toward this issue that took place at the end of the seventeenth

century. Until that change there was no reason – neither in the way organisms were thought
of, nor in the predominant philosophy of nature – that would prevent the church from supporting the widespread belief in spontaneous generation [12] (p. 19).

3.2  Changing concepts of life
Talking about the  origin of life, then, is still potentially theologically charged,
based upon how one defines life. Now for our (by no means exhaustive) sampling
of concepts of what life actually is. Here I hope to show that broader historical context (than religious implications) can be just as informative about trends in defining
life. A useful survey of numerous definitions of life up until the end of the nineteenth century can be found in the opening pages of the 1899  F. J. Allen article
“What is life?”[13].
 Louis Pasteur argued as early as 1860 that optical activity is “the only distinct
line of demarcation that we can show today between dead and living matter.” (He
believed that “cosmic asymmetric forces” were responsible for this.) One of Allen’s
most useful observations is that most of the attempted definitions have some merit,
but they all tried to find a single key formulation to capture an extremely complex,
many-sided phenomenon. “Life,” he says, “is too complex to be described in a concise aphorism” [13] (p. 45). Pasteur was surely pointing out one of the most crucial
features of living systems, but as the 1997 work of Cronin and Pizzarello on non
50:50 enantiomers (the opposite right- and left-handed mirror image versions in
which many organic molecules occur) in extraterrestrial amino acids from meteorites has shown, even that formerly sharp line of demarcation has begun to blur
into a spectrum [14].
Allen then plunges into a review of what is known about the biochemistry of metabolism and a very modern-sounding discussion of the central role of
­“energy-traffic” in cells. He is impressed with the 1875 theory of the German physiologist Eduard Pflüger, that cyanogen is the defining unstable compound of living
reactions, and, ironically enough, notwithstanding his opening caveat, Allen soon
arrives at his own pet, too-concise formulation, which he calls a law: that “every
vital action involves the passage of oxygen either to or from nitrogen” [13] (p. 52).10
He cites another German, Oscar Loew, who has recently suggested that the basis

of life is continuous atomic motion within large unstable organic molecules. Allen
commends the theory for explaining some phenomena, but thinks “Dr. Loew does
not lay enough stress on the functions of nitrogen, to which I personally trace so
many of the phenomena of life. … It is chiefly owing to the instability of nitrogen
compounds that continuous atomic motion is possible” [13] (p. 55). He gives priority to N, among the CHON.
Here we are seeing a transition to a new, biochemical way of talking about the
most basic characteristics of life, both structural and metabolic. But Allen’s attempt
to hold on to some single sine qua non of life represents the deep grip of a late
nineteenth century scientific gestalt that we need to look at more closely, in order
to understand why biochemical ideas that in some ways sound so modern are still
shaped by it. From the 1860s through the first decade of the twentieth century theories abounded as to the simplest “living unit.” From Thomas Graham’s colloid,
containing “energia,” to Huxley’s “protoplasm,” to  Darwin’s “gemmules” of pangenesis, to Hering and Haeckel’s “plastidules,” to Nägeli’s “micelles,” to Verworn’s
“biogen,” in many ways Allen’s  focus on nitrogen as the crucial “living element”
is in this tradition. These theories reflect the fact that from 1860 to perhaps as late
as 1910, “explaining life” was interpreted by most investigators to require addressing all or most of the parts of a large problem complex. This included generation,
development, inheritance, sensation or irritability, evolution, and in some cases the
postulate of a specific biological energy.11 The gradual teasing apart of the strands
of this once-unified problem complex, for instance the separation, from about
1910–1920 of  transmission genetics from embryology/development and its more
inclusive notion of  “inheritance,” greatly altered discussions of the origin of life.
The effect of the new discipline of transmission genetics,  most of all due to
the work of the T. H. Morgan Drosophila school, began to be clearly seen in the
August 1926 paper of  H. J. Muller  “The gene as the basis of life”12 and the 1929
paper of  J. B. S. Haldane “The origin of life” [15]. In Muller’s paper, as John Farley
has pointed out, defining the sudden appearance of a gene molecule as the sharp
point at which life emerged has the paradoxical effect of reviving the supposedly
most outdated feature of the old “spontaneous generation” doctrine: namely the
idea that anything as complex as life could possibly arise in a sudden rapid event. In
 A. I. Oparin’s writings from the 1920s, a gradual chemical evolutionary process is
put forward as much more plausible; i.e. the idea of the emergence of life through a

mind or at least removed this wording, by the second edition in 1920. But it is from Kammerer that Wilhelm
Reich appears to have drawn most directly in positing a specific biological energy.

series of transitional stages. While Haldane was interested in the latest ideas about
 genes, he leaned more toward the Oparin approach:

Copyright © 2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

In the present state of our ignorance we may regard the gene either as a tiny organism
which can divide in the environment provided by the rest of the cell; or as a bit of machinery which the “living” cell copies at each division. The truth is probably somewhere in
between these two hypotheses. … Unless a living creature is a piece of dead matter plus a
soul (a view which finds little support in modern biology) something of the following kind
must be true. A simple organism must consist of parts A, B, C, D, and so on, each of which
can multiply only in the presence of all, or almost all, of the others [15]  (p. 6).

Here Haldane  makes an early but cogent statement on what are now called
“emergent properties.”
A brief look, now, at two recent books will quickly bring out numerous points
about trends in defining life in the past 40–50 years and the historical context in
which these trends developed. The books are  Freeman Dyson’s  Origins of Life and
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry’s  The Origins of Life: from the Birth of Life to the
Origin of Language [16, 17].13
Being a physicist allows Dyson to see [16] (pp. 6–7) the extent to which much
thinking among biologists is predisposed by their own philosophical assumptions;
as for instance, why such an overwhelming majority of life scientists raised since
Watson and Crick believe information-carrying molecules more fundamental to
life than biochemical metabolism. This, despite the fact that, ever since researchers have seen the origin of life to be predicated upon the origin of  DNA,  RNA, or
some other more primitive information-carrying molecule, the result has been the
chicken–egg problem because of the interdependence of  proteins and nucleic acids
in extant cells. Dyson is less aware, or at least does not stop to comment on, the
degree to which his own reasoning [16] (pp. 7–8) is being guided just as forcefully
by notions about “hardware” and “software” inherited from the culture of computer technology. This is not to imply that use of these analogies in thinking about
living systems is necessarily faulty. But rather, just as the dominance of machines
in scientific cultures cannot be said to be historically unrelated to the growth of the
mechanistic view of life from 1850–1950, one ought at least to note that the ideas
of hardware and software are not merely disconnected intellectual “ideas” floating
around, but also fundamentally cultural resources, being drawn upon here by scientists. Thus, it is worth asking the question: do these ideas come into the scientific
arena freighted with any other interesting cultural or philosophical baggage? More
on this later.

Dyson emphasizes the need to distinguish between replication and reproduction,
in order to break the logical “catch-22” deadlock that results when one considers
DNA- or RNA-centered systems to be the sine qua non of life. Dyson gives Von
Neumann credit for emphasizing the distinction between replication and metabolism. This is the most significant distinction Dyson rightly emphasizes in his book.
But one can only wonder why he lauds Schrödinger and Von Neumann’s early and
vague approaches to this distinction, while studiously avoiding mention of  Sidney
Fox and his school – those who first made the issue of “proteins first” vs. what
they called “the nucleic acid monopoly” central in the origin-of-life debate. Of
course, the two big name physicists have become revered in science (and Dyson
himself is a physicist), while Fox  was a protein chemist who eventually became
marginalized by the mainstream origin-of-life community.14 So if one is constructing a ­“forerunners” pedigree for one’s most important idea, perhaps the temptation
is overwhelming to attribute that idea to winners and silently pass over losers,
especially if one at the outset intends to write a highly condensed narrative that
disclaims any attempt at comprehensiveness. From a historian’s point of view, this
practice is in itself an object of study.
Dyson points out that Schrödinger saw biology through the eyes of the physicist-turned-biologist Max Delbrück and historians have elaborated at some length
on the construction of a master narrative of the history of molecular biology that
emphasizes only the line from Schrödinger, Delbrück, and Salvador Luria (the
team which in the early 1940s famously began experiments on bacteriophage genetics) to Watson and Crick. Dyson  says that thus Delbrück’s focus on replication
(and later on nucleic acids) as the central feature of the origin of life gained undue
prominence in the field and came to dominate the mindset of most researchers.
This insight into “paradigms” and their control of thinking in the field has been
stated repeatedly over the last twenty-five years.15
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry’s The Origins of Life sets out to describe and
explain what they plausibly argue are the eight major qualitative transitions that
have occurred in the history of life since the origin of replicating molecules.16
The book is an eloquent and very illuminating analysis of these transitions and
of some very important parallel trends among them [17] (pp. 19–25). But as a
result of such breadth of conceptual reach, it manages to survey only somewhat

Biosphere, 29 (1999), 109–112, 110. Fox’s work, as well as the process of marginalizing him, are discussed

superficially the origin of life per se. The major transitions they address are:
replicating molecules → populations of molecules in compartments; independent replicators → chromosomes;  RNA as gene and enzyme →  DNA and protein;
prokaryote → eukaryote; asexual clones → sexual populations; protists → animals,
plants, and fungi; solitary individuals → colonies; primate societies → human societies
and the origin of language.
In The Origins of Life, immediately from the first page, the focus is on information. The question of  metabolism being of equal importance, let alone first in time
(as in Dyson), is very briefly raised [17] (p. 12), only to be dismissed or minimized:
their overall usage betrays a strong bias toward an “information-first” view of life.
Their approach clearly assumes that life is synonymous with replication.17
There is no more historical a phenomenon in modern biology than the dialectically related rise of information theory and computers, and the simultaneous importation of such analysis into biological thinking, beginning no later than
Schrödinger’s 1944 work What Is Life?18  Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry tackle
this strikingly parallel development of concepts right away. It would seem strange
or incomprehensible to  Darwin, they say [17] (p. 2), that template reproduction
allows transmission of instructions in a homogeneous-looking, as yet unformed
egg or zygote. The idea is much less strange to us because “we are familiar with the
idea that patterns of magnetism on a magnetic tape can carry the instructions for
producing a symphony.” Indeed, they close their book with a tantalizing guess that
the move to transmitting information in electronic form may be potentially a transition on the scale of the other major transitions around which the book is framed. It
is astute of the authors to recognize how much our cultural experience enables our
view, especially on questions of such fundamental importance as “what is life?”
However, being more or less complete advocates of the information-first approach
to conceptualizing life, they seem to miss the other implication of the power of historical context. If our cultural experience enables our view, it also simultaneously
constrains it. The primacy of computers and electronic information in our lives
makes images of “programming” of instincts, “hard-wiring” of certain traits, etc.,
highly compelling metaphors for how we think about “life” in late twentieth century, high-tech Western society. But these metaphors tend to channel one’s thinking
strongly, above and beyond the actual experimental evidence, as in the nature–
nurture debate where “master molecule” and “inborn hard-wiring” metaphors have

boosted the stock of biological determinism far above even the rapidly growing
knowledge-base of molecular genetics. We may well reflect on the dominance of
such models, when they say [17] (p. 13) “a living being resembles a computer, rather
than just a program, although it has its own program as subsystem.” The irony of
the back-and-forth relations between culture and nature is never more provocative
than in this passage [17] (pp. 12–13), where computers and computer “viruses” are
used as the standard against which to evaluate whether biological viruses should
be thought of as truly alive. Is this not putting the cart before the horse in some
fundamental ontological sense? One is reminded of N. W. Pirie’s 1937 remark:

Copyright © 2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

When one is asked whether a filter-passing virus is living or dead the only sensible answer
is: “I don’t know; we know a number of things it will do and a number of things it won’t,
and if some commission will define the word ‘living’ I will try to see how the virus fits
into the definition.” His answer as a rule does not satisfy the questioner, who generally
has strong but unformulated opinions about what he means by the words living and dead.
The virus worker may then be told, to take one example out of many equally foolish, that
a certain virus cannot be living because its physical properties enable us to investigate it
in some detail [18] (p. 12).

As we shall see in origin-of-life debates, the possibly crucial question that gets
drowned out by talk of the primacy of information (and thus, of nucleic acids) is:
can there be any other central characteristic of living systems as fundamental as,
or perhaps even more fundamental than, information? Granted,  Maynard Smith
and  Szathmáry give a brilliant and powerful analysis of events since the evolution of information-carrying molecules. But their bias leaves us with the chicken–
egg problem: if  metabolism is dominated mostly by  proteins, but is a prerequisite
for the functioning of nucleic acid information molecules, how can a system like
our current living cell, even the simplest prokaryote, with each of these two parts
totally dependent upon the other, ever have evolved in the first place? (In this way,
giving primacy to nucleic acids/information plays into the hands of  creationists.)
This is the issue upon which Dyson’s book is so focused.
Not that Dyson is the first to raise this issue. Ever since Harvard biochemist
Leonard Troland’s 1914 [19] paper emphasizing autocatalytic enzymes and  Muller’s
1926 [20] gene-first response, this tension has been a central focus of debate and
discussion in the origin-of-life literature. Noted advocates toward Muller’s  end of
the spectrum have included Norman Horowitz and  Carl Sagan. Toward the opposite end have been  A. I. Oparin, J. D. Bernal, N. W. Pirie, and  Sidney Fox. The boom
of interest in ribozymes and the “RNA world,” beginning with  Thomas Cech’s
1982 discovery of  catalytic RNA molecules, was precisely because it was hoped
this phenomenon would finally offer a way out of the impasse that dominated much
of twentieth century discussion. If the simplest nucleic acid information molecules
can also simultaneously perform the enzyme role, previously thought only to be a

property of proteins, then  catalytic RNA molecules could be the “missing link”
bridging the gap between these two now separate but interdependent functions.
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry clearly hope [17] ribozymes offered the solution
to the catch-22. But this now seems to have been excessively optimistic [21].19 For,
while  RNA does seem to have the dual capabilities to bridge the gap, its monomers are so difficult to form spontaneously, and are so short-lived under primitive
Earth conditions, that the question of how to get from an abiotic world to the RNA
world is not much easier to solve than before the RNA world transitional stage was
known.20 Information is surely one of the fundamental issues for living systems as
we know them, but we are still unclear as to whether it came first or is the sine qua
non of the first life or its molecular predecessors.  
In conclusion, I hope this chapter has demonstrated the need to look at the religious/theological context as well as the broader historical/cultural context in order
to begin to understand how ideas about defining life and life’s origins have changed
over time. Since the theory was first discussed, common cultural assumptions about
the nature of life and/or common religious assumptions about its origin have been
prominent forces shaping the conceptions of the scientific community.

 Philosophical aspects of the origin-of-life
problem: the emergence of life and the
nature of science
Iris Fry

4.1  Introduction
At a public lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, the renowned French scientist  Louis
Pasteur raised the fundamental philosophical question pertaining to the origin of
life: can matter organize itself to form a living system? Pasteur answered this question with a decisive no. He was referring both to the emergence of life on the primordial Earth and to the possibility of “spontaneous generation” – the formation of
living organisms out of matter here and now. Life, Pasteur believed, was originally
created by God and organisms are subsequently born only from parents.1
Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the German philosopher  Immanuel
Kant had also pondered the question of the nature of biological organization and
its emergence from matter. Unlike other physical objects, Kant noted, an organism
is an interactive system in which parts and whole are reciprocally dependent.2 This
circular, self-reproducing nature defines a living system and the critical question is
whether we can understand the production of such an organized, functional whole
in causal, materialistic terms [1] (77: 293).
For Kant , the idea of physical principles of self-organization, working mechanistically without any guiding plan and yet capable of producing an organized whole,
was inconceivable. Hence, the very possibility of the emergence of life from matter seemed to him absurd [1] (80:305, note 5; 81:311). Although not sharing Kant’s
 Several historical studies reveal that  Pasteur’s position on the relationship between matter and life was far
more complex than apparent from the standard Pasteur’s scientific biography. See G. L. Geison. The Private
Science of Louis Pasteur (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995), pp. 133–138.

This unique nature of organisms was evident to any keen observer of the living world long before the establishment of modern biology. The most notable manifestation of this awareness is to be found in the fourth century
BCE in the biological treatises of Aristotle. See M. C. Nussbaum. Aristotle on teleological explanations. In
Aristotle’s De Motu Animalium: Text with Translation, Commentary, and Interpretive Essays (Princeton, NJ:
