6.1 Introduction
Of the three big questions astrobiology addresses, none has captured the public
imagination as much as the question, ‘Are we alone?’As knowledge increases about
the physical environments available in the universe, organisms on the Earth are used
to gauge the minimum envelope for life. Organisms that live on the physical and
chemical (and perhaps, biological) boundaries are called ‘extremophiles’. Members
of the domain Archaea are undoubtedly the high-temperature champions on Earth,
surviving at temperatures far above the boiling point of water. However, a wide
phylogenetic variety of organisms are able to inhabit other extremes, from low
temperature to high salinity, from desiccation to high levels of radiation. In some
cases, the adaptation is as simple as keeping ions out of the cell (low pH), but
in others more profound adaptations are required. Reactive oxygen species are
highly toxic, and thus organisms that are aerobic are arguably extremophilic. Thus,
extraterrestrial habitats previously thought to be uninhabitable have been shown to
be, at least theoretically, habitable, thus informing the search for life elsewhere.
Extremophilic organisms, or ‘extremophiles’, are integral to understanding the
three big questions in astrobiology: Where do we come from? Where are we
going? Are we alone? We do not know the environmental conditions under which
life arose, although speculation includes hydrothermal areas; nor do we know the
environments in which the earliest life forms existed. The future study of life on this
planet and elsewhere is likely to include extremophiles, as our nearest neighbours
present environments that are, in many respects, extreme. Herein, I focus on the
importance of extremophiles for deﬁning the boundary conditions for life. The focus
will involve exploring the diversity of extremophiles, mechanisms for adaptation,
examples of extreme ecosystems, and space as an extreme environment.
Although this chapter contains examples of organisms that live in extreme
environments on Earth that overlap with environmental conditions found elsewhere,

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

this does not entail these organisms will be found elsewhere. In fact, if they were,
then their presence may be considered prima facie evidence of contamination,
as it is extraordinarily unlikely that identical organisms would be found on other
celestial bodies any other way. The critical point is that by studying extremophiles
on Earth, currently the only source of living organisms, we can deﬁne an envelope
for life in the Universe. We must be aware that this provides the minimum envelope
for life. The envelope is likely to be extended as we discover new organisms, and
life on Earth may not be able to or have had the opportunity to test all possible
environmental habitats.

6.2 What is an extremophile?
The word ‘extremophile’, coined by Bob MacElroy (1974) from the Latin
‘extremus’ and the Greek ‘philos’, literally means ‘lover of extremes’.
Unfortunately, even the deﬁnition is not as clear as one might think. Extreme is
usually taken to refer to physical, chemical, or, rarely, biological conditions. But
what is extreme?
There is an objective deﬁnition of extreme, owing to the fact that life on Earth is
based on organic carbon with water as a solvent. Thus, conditions that disrupt the
integrity or function of aqueous solutions of organic compounds are extreme.
Must extremophiles ‘love’extreme conditions? Scientists tend to be inconsistent;
when it comes to temperature, extremophiles thrive optimally at the extreme
temperatures. However, for many extremes, from pH to radiation, the extremophile
organisms grow well, or even grow better, under less-extreme conditions.
The ability to thrive under extreme conditions may be limited to particular life
stages. For example, some species of frogs, turtles, and snakes can tolerate freezing
of extracellular water, but only after the production of appropriate antifreeze
molecules in the autumn (Storey and Storey, 1996).
Which taxa contain extremophiles? With attention focused on temperature and
salt tolerance, biologists tend to equate Archaea with extremophiles. This is
inaccurate, as many extremophiles are Eubacteria and Eukarya, and additionally
an increasing number of non-extremophilic Archaea are being uncovered.
Reasons for studying extremophiles are listed in Table 6.1. Only the last ﬁve
are primarily or exclusively the territory of astrobiologists: the future use of
extremophiles in space – perhaps for life support, perhaps for terraforming; the
biodiversity of life on Earth, mechanisms to survive extreme environments, and
the limits for life in the universe.
It is interesting to note that extremophiles have been used to look for life in
the Universe not as a recent construct of astrobiology, but rather as a nineteenthcentury suggestion. Richard Proctor, a popular science writer for the public, was

probably the ﬁrst to connect the study of life in extreme environments and life on
other planets (Proctor, 1870, Chapter 1):
If we range over the [E]arth, from the arctic regions to the torrid zone, we ﬁnd that none of
the peculiarities which mark the several regions of our globe sufﬁce to banish life from its
surface.

While this chapter will focus almost exclusively on microbes, even humans inhabit
extreme environments, including outer space (for a fascinating review of human
adaptations to extreme environments, see Ashcroft (2001)).

6.3 Categories of extremophiles
The challenges posed by extreme environments range from physical factors such
as temperature and pressure to chemical extremes such as pH and oxygen tension
(reviewed in Rothschild and Mancinelli (2001); Table 6.2).

6.4 Environmental extremes
6.4.1 Temperature
Why should temperature make a difference to organisms? Organisms rely on
biomolecules, all of which will break down at some temperature. For example,
chlorophyll degrades near 75 ◦ C (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001). The melting
temperature of nucleic acids depends on the base composition (A–T bonds are less
thermostable than are G–C bonds), the length of the polymer, and the solvent
including the concentrations of ions in solution, but even DNA normally will
degrade well below 100 ◦ C.

As temperature increases, proteins denature, which results in loss of quaternary,
tertiary, and even secondary structures. This rules out their use as structural
compounds.
Denatured enzymes lose their catalytic activity. But even when active, enzymes
have a minimum, a maximum and an optimum temperature for function. By
deﬁnition, at temperatures above or below the maximum, enzymatic function slows.
The solubility of gases in a liquid, including water, varies depending on
temperature. As anyone who has opened a cold bottle of soda knows, the solubility
of gases in liquids decreases with increasing temperature. As aquatic organisms
often utilize soluble gases, such as CO2 or O2 , high temperature decreases the
availability of gases.
At low temperatures, water freezes. During freezing, solutes concentrate creating
high, perhaps toxic, concentrations of solutes. Once the water is frozen, the ice
crystals may act like tiny swords, piercing the cell membranes, and thus destroying
cellular integrity.
These effects of temperature on biological compounds strongly suggest that life
should have a fairly narrow temperature range, from above the freezing point of
water to well below its boiling point. Thus, it was surprising to Tom Brock when,
in July 1964, he detected living organisms in the run-off channels of hot springs in
Yellowstone National Park. Later in the summer he noticed pink, gelatinous mats
in Pool A of Octopus Spring, about six miles south of Old Faithful (Figure 6.1).
At the time ‘high temperature’ was considered to be 60 ◦ C. In 1966, Brock’s
graduate student, Hudson Freeze, cultured YT-1 (later known as Thermus aquaticus)
from Mushroom Spring. T. aquaticus is the source for Taq polymerase which,
when used as part of the polymerase chain reaction, revolutionized biology in
the late twentieth century. Inspired by reports of this work (Brock, 1967), as
well as the work of Woese (e.g., Woese and Fox (1977)) revealing the presence
of the Archaea, Karl Stetter became the leading ﬁgure in thermophile research
(see Chapter 7).
In 1977, the exploratory submarine Alvin travelled through the Panama Canal
for the ﬁrst time. Geological work in the Galapagos Rift was completed during
February and March. The major discovery of an abundance of exotic animal life
on and in the immediate proximity of warm water vents prompted theories about
the generation of life. Because no light can penetrate through the deep waters,
scientists concluded that the animal chemistry there is based on chemosynthesis,
not photosynthesis. Since then, Alvin has located more than 24 hydrothermal sites
in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans. It also has allowed researchers to ﬁnd and record
about 300 new species of animals, including bacteria, foot-long clams and mussels,
tiny shrimp, arthropods, and red-tipped tube worms that can grow up to 3 m long
in some vents.

bacterium, Thermocrinis ruber (Reysenbach et al., 1994; Huber et al., 1998). The
mats are growing at approximately 81 ◦ C. Note that Octopus is 7352 ft above
sea-level, and therefore the boiling point of water is depressed. In the front of
the photo is a section of the source, which is boiling, yet it too contains living
hyperthermophiles. Photo captured 3 August 2006.

The ability to withstand ﬁre is not normally considered an extreme-environment
adaption, but it is worth mention here. Fire-triggered germination is widespread in
the plant families Fabaceae, Rhamnaceae, Convolvulaceae, Malvaceae, Cistaceae,
and Sterculiaceae. The trigger is either heat shock or the chemical products of
combustion, rather than ﬁre itself (Keeley and Fotheringham, 1998).
The ability of organisms to thrive in cold temperature environments has a
much longer history. The great nineteenth-century microbiologist, Ferdinand Cohn,
noticed algae that grow on snow, a phenomenon often referred to as ‘watermelon
snow’ (Figure 6.2). Cold temperature organisms, or psychrophiles, were studied
from the marine environment by Certes in the 1980s and Conn in the early
twentieth century. ZoBell and his students – particularly Dick Morita – studied
these organisms and were the ﬁrst to get deep-sea samples from the 1957 Galathea
expeditions to ocean trenches. They were the ﬁrst to study these psychrophiles
and barophiles. By the 1980s, multiple ﬁeld campaigns were being staged to
the Dry Valleys of the Antarctic to study the microbes in the permanently
ice-covered lakes (Figure 6.3). These lakes were seen as a model system for

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

6.4.2 pH limits for life
The acidity of a solution, referred to as pH, quantiﬁes the activity of hydrogen ions.
In dilute solutions, the activity is approximately equal to the numeric value of the
concentration of the H+ ion, denoted as [H+ ]. Thus,

Copyright © 2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

pH ∼ − log10 |[H+ ]|

(6.1)

Seawater (currently) has a pH of 8.2. This means that it has a [H+ ] of 10−8.2
mol l−1 , or approximately 6.31 × 10−9 mol l−1 . While the pH scale is thought of
as ranging from 0 to 14, a pH below 0 or above 14 is possible. For example, acid
mine run-off can have a pH of −3.6, corresponding to a molar concentration of H+
of 3981 M. The cytoplasm of most cells is near neutral, which is pH 7.
Life at pH extremes is difﬁcult. At low pH, in the absence of a proton pump,
hydrogen ions can rush into the cell, lowering the pH of the internal environment,
thereby disrupting the internal biochemistry of the cell. At extremely low pH,
proteins denature, which is the principle behind preservation at extremely low pH.
Organisms that live at high pH and use proton pumps ﬁnd it difﬁcult to locate
enough protons.
Yet, in spite of this, eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes from low pH
environments have been observed for several decades. The red alga, Cyanidium
caldarium (Fig. 6.3), can live at pH ∼ 0 (Seckbach, 1999). The Archaea Picrophilus
oshimae and Picrophilus torridus live in dry soils below pH 0.5 (Schleper et al.,
1995); and Ferroplasma acidarmanus, isolated from acid mine drainage, can
grow at pH 0 (Edwards et al., 2000). A diversity of organisms, from bacteria to
cyanobacteria to rotifers, can live at pH 10.5 (e.g., Martins et al. (2001)). Microbial
communities live at pH 12.9 in the soda lakes of Maqarin, Jordan (Pedersen et al.,
2004). It should be noted that soda lakes, in general, tend to be highly productive,
with high concentrations of cyanobacteria because of the high concentration of
dissolved CO2 (Grant et al., 1990; Rees et al., 2004).
Work on life at low pH started because of the use of acidic conditions for food
preservation (e.g., sauerkraut), but more recently low pH organisms have been
useful as model systems for biochemistry research. In the late 1960s in particular
(e.g., Seckbach et al. (1970)), but still to the present day, acidophiles have been
used as model systems for a potential life form on Venus (e.g., Schulze-Makuch
et al. (2004) and references therein).
The biotechnical potential also is enormous, as there are times in industrial
processes where it is most economical to conduct the reactions at either high or
low pH. An example of the economic signiﬁcance of these organisms comes from
the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), who planned to launch a multimillion dollar
legal claim against Genencor and Procter & Gamble, alleging that a microbial

cellulase enzyme illegally obtained from a soda lake in the country was used as an
ingredient in the latter company’s Tide laundry detergent (Sheridan, 2004).
6.4.3 Life in high salt
Red waters have been noted since biblical times, and Charles Darwin observed
red ponds in South America during his voyage on HMS Beagle. But halophiles,
organisms that live in 2–5 M salt, were ﬁrst noted in the early twentieth century
in conjunction with spoilage of food preserved in salt and yet red. In preparation
for the Viking missions to Mars, halophiles became of importance in the search
for life elsewhere. More recently, the discovery of evaporites on Mars and life in
evaporites on Earth, and the presumed radiation resistance of halophilic organisms
have also contributed to the astrobiological interest in halophiles (e.g., Rothschild
(1990), Rothschild et al. (1994), Forsythe and Zimbelman (1995), McLennan et al.
(2005)).
Halophiles are predominantly found among the Archaea and Bacteria. One
eukaryote, the green alga Dunaliella salina, is well known from a variety of
hypersaline environments. D. salina has been particularly useful commercially
because the glycerol and β-carotene that it accumulates can be harvested.
Halophiles are also desiccation resistant.

6.4.4 Desiccation (anhydrobiosis)
Desiccation is one of the oldest methods of food preservation. In ancient times,
the sun and wind would have dried foods naturally, as they do with grapes on the
vine producing raisins. There is evidence that the Middle Eastern cultures actively
dried food in the sun as early as 12 000 BCE. The Romans in particular were fond
of any dried fruit, but meats, especially pork, and cereal grains such as rice and
wheat, have been dried or smoked for millennia. Desiccation preserves because all
life on Earth relies heavily on the presence of liquid water, although it is possible
that some lichens can survive on water vapour.
So, as with the other extremophiles that we have considered here, many organisms
are extremely good at tolerating this extreme (Crowe et al., 1992). Many microbes
and plants use desiccation-resistant spores to weather dry periods and for dispersal.
A variety of invertebrates, including nematodes and rotifers, are anhydrobiotic
(Watanabe, 2006), and some, such as tardigrades, are known to survive desiccation
for well over 100 years dried on herbarium samples.
Organisms that can survive extreme dehydration are also resistant to freezing to
very low temperatures, elevated temperature for brief periods, and the effects of
ionizing radiation (Crowe and Crowe, 1992).

6.4.5 Pressure
Organisms can live at extraordinarily high pressures, as evidenced by the lush
microbial and invertebrate communities in the deep sea. Some of these organisms
can also survive normal atmospheric pressure, while others cannot. Interestingly,
the surface bacteria Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis have been shown
to be metabolically active up to 1600 MPa, substantially higher than ambient
pressure (0.1 MPa) (Sharma et al., 2002).

Copyright © 2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

6.4.6 Radiation
Organisms are exposed to a variety of types of radiation on Earth. Some types
of radiation have been constant for organisms over geological time, such as
those from naturally occurring radioactive substances, while ultraviolet radiation
received by organisms has varied as the Sun has aged and atmospheric oxygen has
risen. Solar radiation exposure also varies seasonally and diurnally. Throughout
the history of Earth, ultraviolet radiation below 200 nm has been blocked from
reaching the surface by atmospheric CO2 . Since the rise of atmospheric oxygen
and ozone over 2 billion years ago (see Chapter 11), much of the radiation
below 300 nm has been attenuated as well. This is particularly important because
the peak absorption for nucleic acids is ∼260 nm and that for proteins is, on
average, ∼280 nm.
More recently, life has been exposed to radiation from man-made sources, such
as nuclear reactors. And, of course, with the advent of space exploration, organisms
from Earth have gone beyond its protective atmosphere to low orbit, the Moon, and,
now, beyond the edge of our Solar System as hitchhikers on the Voyager spacecraft.
Radioactivity, a term coined by Marie Curie, was found to be hazardous to living
organisms very quickly after the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Roentgen in
1895. Radiation damages nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids directly and indirectly
through the production of reactive oxygen radicals. While the types of radiation
vary, the types of damage are similar, ranging from modiﬁed bases to singlestrand and double-strand breaks. With oxidative damage, oxidation of lipids and
proteins can also occur. Thus, in 1956, when a can of γ radiation-sterilized
meat surprisingly spoiled, Arthur W. Anderson at Oregon Agricultural Experiment
Station in Corvallis, investigated and found the culprit: the aerobic bacterium
Deinococcus radiodurans.
D. radiodurans is not just phenomenally radiation-resistant, but it is also
desiccation-resistant. This has led to the hypothesis that the radiation resistance
is incidental to desiccation resistance (Battista, 1997). Certainly organisms that
are desiccated are not able to repair DNA damage; so, upon rehydration, there is
pressure to repair the accumulated damage rapidly.

6.5 How do they do it?

6.4.7 High oxygen
High oxygen seems an odd addition to a list of extreme parameters; are we not
exquisitely adapted to living in 21% oxygen? In fact, oxygen levels on Earth are
thought to have been as high as 35% during the Permo-Carboniferous, 248–354
million years ago (Berner et al., 2003), deep into the age of multicellular life.
Although we consider an aerobic lifestyle to be ‘normal’, I will argue that, in
reality, oxygen presents one of the most severe challenges to organisms based on
organic carbon, concluding that we, like all aerobes, are extremophiles.
Aerobic metabolism arose and became dominant because it is far more efﬁcient
than anaerobic metabolism, generating 18 times more ATP per molecule of glucose
metabolized. However, during the reduction of oxygen to water, or the oxidation
of water, a series of reactive oxygen species is produced, the worst of which, for a
biological system, is the hydroxyl radical (·OH). These reactions, from oxygen to
the superoxide anion (O−
2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), the hydroxyl radical (·OH),
and H2 O, are shown in Equation (6.2).
O2 ↔ O2− ↔ H2 O2 ↔ OH ↔ H2 O

(6.2)

Oxidative damage to DNA is well known and includes modiﬁcation of bases
to single-strand breaks to double-strand breaks. Reactive oxygen species also
cause damage to lipids and proteins. Current research suggests that the increased
production of reactive oxygen species is a feature of most, if not all, human disease,
including cardiovascular disease and cancer (Jacob and Burri, 1996).

6.5 How do they do it?
Sometimes, evolution ﬁnds the route of the least number of changes, which I dub
‘the laziness principle’. If the internal environment of a cell alters radically, there
would have to be a massive reworking of the internal environment necessitating
massive changes in the biomolecules and possibly pathways.
For these reasons, the simplest approach to living in extreme environments is to
keep the external environment out. This is what we do by wearing clothes, mammals
do by growing fur, and so on. Living under protective materials, such as sand or
salt, is another strategy (Rothschild and Giver, 2003). A similar approach is taken to
living at low pH. Acidophiles maintain a roughly neutral internal pH by evolving a
strong proton pump or having low permeability to protons. Conversely, alkaliphiles
(organisms that live at high pH) maintain an internal pH two or more units below
the external medium by evolving an effective proton transport system.
As with pH, a variety of organisms can withstand anhydrobiosis, suggesting that
this adaptation is relatively straightforward to evolve. Usually the synthesis of a

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

disaccharide such as trehalose in microbes, animals, and fungi, or sucrose in plants,
is sufﬁcient to survive desiccation (Crowe et al., 1992). Trehalose may provide
effective protection against desiccation because it has superior biochemical and
physicochemical properties for stabilizing membranes and biomolecules including
proteins and lipids (Watanabe, 2006) by hydrogen bonding to polar residues in the
dry macromolecular assemblages (Crowe et al., 1998). However, both trehalose and
sucrose form glasses in the dry state; so it has been suggested that glass formation
(vitriﬁcation) is in itself sufﬁcient to stabilize dry biomolecules (Sun et al., 1998).
Crowe et al. (1998) have shown that, while vitriﬁcation is required, it is not in itself
sufﬁcient to allow anhydrobiosis.
A further complication arises because anhydrobiosis occurs in the absence of
trehalose or other disaccharides in bdelloid rotifers (Lapinski and Tunnacliffe,
2003). Thus, there may be alternative pathways to desiccation resistance.
Similarly, halophiles often are able to cope by the accumulation of a compatible
solute. The internal osmotica include K+ for Archaea, glycine betaine and organic
compounds in Bacteria, and glycerol in the eukaryote Dunaliella salina.
If the external environment cannot be kept out, sometimes small modiﬁcations
can be made to the internal environment. For example, enzyme activities can adapt
to lower temperatures, and the lipid composition of the membrane can be altered
to avoid loss of ﬂuidity at low temperatures. At temperatures below freezing, ice
forms, which is doubly dangerous. First, as the ice forms, it removes water and
increases the concentration of solutes in the remaining water. Second, ice crystals
themselves can cause physical damage to cell membranes. Antifreeze molecule(s)
can prevent this damage. For example, the accumulation of glycerol in frogs allows
natural tolerance to freezing (Schmid, 1982), as do the antifreeze proteins in ﬁsh
provide the same function (e.g., Davies and Hew (1990), Clarke (2003)).
High temperature is normally lethal for a number of reasons, ranging from
lowered solubility of gases at high temperature, to denaturation of proteins and
nucleic acids. High temperature can be avoided by use of cold water circulation
over the exterior, such as in the pompei worm. However, hyperthermophiles are
required to make multiple changes to their internal biochemistry for survival. Salt
bridges have long been known to stabilize proteins in thermophiles (Perutz, 1978).
With increasing temperature, prokaryotes tend to acquire adenine and lose cytosine,
while keeping thymine and guanosine relatively constant (Lambros et al., 2003).
Because of the economic interest in hyperthermophiles, this is an active area of
interest.
Resistance to radiation damage, and the related phenomenon of oxidative
damage, is critical for life. Thus, multiple pathways exist in all organisms
(reviewed extensively elsewhere; e.g., Yasui and McCready (1998), Petit and Sancar
(1999), Smith (2004)). These include photorepair, excision repair, and homologous

recombinational repair, among others. However, the key to the remarkable ability
of D. radiodurans to resist radiation might be the fact that the DNA is held in a
ring-like structure, thus enabling the cell to ligate the broken strands in the correct
order (Levin-Zaidman et al., 2003), although its ability to accumulate manganese
while keeping a low intracellular level of iron also may be a contributing factor to
resistance (Daly et al., 2004).

6.6 Examples of extreme ecosystems

Even excluding our nearly ubiquitous high oxygen terrestrial environment,
there is a remarkable diversity of extreme habitats on Earth (Table 6.2;
Figures 6.1–6.4). These range from the ice at the poles to the searing heat of
hydrothermal vents. Paralana Spring, in the Flinders Ranges of Australia, bubbles
radioactivity (Figure 6.4). As suggested above, many of these have multiple
extreme environments simultaneously. Thus, while the source of Octopus Springs
in Yellowstone National Park is at the boilina pH ∼8.2, a pH similar to that of the
ocean, Congress Springs also is boiling but with a pH of near 0. Laguna Colorada,
a hypersaline lake in the Bolivian Altiplano, has a moderately alkaline pH of 8.4,
but is hypersaline and, thus, populated by halophiles. At an altitude of 4364 m,
and a location of 22 ◦ 15.836 S; 67 ◦ 48.970 W, the organisms are also subjected

Despite high levels of radon, radium, and uranium, not to mention a high ultraviolet
ﬂux, there is a lush microbial community growing in the source of Paralana Spring,
shown here with bubbles of radon.

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

to exceptionally high levels of UVB radiation in the austral summer (Rothschild,
unpublished).
An extreme environment that is poorly studied is that of the air. An airborne organism must deal with the effects of desiccation, decreasing temperature,
ultraviolet radiation, and a nutrient-poor environment. Of course, with increasing
elevation, oxygen decreases as well. The great microbiologist Louis Pasteur did
some of the early work on aerobiology, but current work is conducted primarily
for military reasons, to investigate spread of air-borne pathogens, and to preserve
monuments.
While many extreme environments occur naturally, there are new, human-made
environments as well. In particular, nuclear reactors (high radiation) and acid mine
drainage (high metals, low pH) can provide novel challenges.

6.7 Space: new categories of extreme environments
Assuming that all organisms on Earth are indigenous to this planet, outer space
provides new extreme environments. Life beyond Earth is difﬁcult for at least six
reasons.

Copyright © 2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

(i) Atmospheric composition is likely to be grossly different.
(ii) Gravity can range from nearly zero to lower than on Earth on other rocky planets
(although higher on the gas giants).
(iii) Space itself is almost a vacuum.
(iv) Temperature extremes occur even in our planetary neighbourhood.
(v) Nutrient sources are different and may well be non-existent.
(vi) The radiation regimes are grossly different.

Cosmic and solar particle radiation are non-existent on Earth, but quickly
add to the woes of increased ultraviolet ﬂux beyond Earth’s atmosphere and
magnetosphere.
A series of experiments has been conducted, primarily by the Europeans under
the aegis of the ESA, to test the ability of terrestrial organisms to withstand the
rigours of space. The ﬁrst studies were done on balloons and rockets, and, later,
on spacecraft in low Earth orbit and outside the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (Apollo
missions 16 and 17). The low Earth orbit experiments have been conducted on a
variety of platforms including Spacelab 1, Spacelab D2, the Exobiology Radiation
Assembly (ERA) on the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), NASA’s Long
Duration Exposure-Facility (LDEF), and Biopan on the Russian satellite Foton.
From 1994 to 2006, 25 exobiology experiments were performed on Biopan, an
ESA space-exposure platform on a satellite, allowing two-week ﬂight opportunities
(Schulte et al., 2006). Samples were exposed to the rigours of outer space vacuum

and the resulting desiccation and radiation regime. Plans are ﬁnalized for a similar
exposure facility to be attached to the outside of the International Space Station
in 2007. The plan is that EXPOSE will allow one-year experiments. Isolated short
duration experiments continue (e.g., Saffary et al. (2002)).
Early on Horneck showed that the spores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis
could survive such exposure (e.g., Horneck et al. (1984), Horneck (1993, 1999)).
Since then, bacterial spores mixed with Mars soil analogues, permafrost soil
samples with their embedded bacterial spores, and viruses also have survived. But,
whereas spores are expected to be particularly resistant to environmental extremes
(e.g., Nicholson et al. (2000)), Mancinelli et al. (1998) were the ﬁrst to show
survival of cells in the vegetative state. Since then, lichens and yeast have also been
shown to survive space travel.
6.8 Life in the Solar System?
While planet Earth is the only body in the Solar System, indeed our Universe, that
we know to be infested with life, there are several other possible habitats. Assuming
that liquid water is a necessity (see Benner et al. (2004) and Shulze-Makuch and
Irwin (2004) for a discussion of this and alternatives), there are two planets (Venus
and Mars), and several moons (e.g., Europa and Enceladus) that currently are the
most-likely candidates to harbour life (see Chapter 5). If one assumes that an organic
solvent, such as methane alone or in combination with water, could be a solvent for
life, then the search extends to Titan.

6.8.1 Venus
While Proctor and others have discussed the possibility of an extant Venusian
biosphere, most people believe Venus to be sterile today. The surface of Venus is
the hottest in the Solar System at 477 ◦ C, so there is no liquid water. This was caused
by a run-away greenhouse effect where the carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere (96%
CO2 with 3% N2 ) trapped incident sunlight raising temperatures. Additionally,
clouds of sulphuric acid abound and the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that
of Earth at sea level. The information we have on the surface of Venus was obtained
from the Russian Venera landers from the 1980s, which survived on the surface for
about 60 minutes. Additional information has been gained from NASA’s Magellan
spacecraft, the Russian Venera orbiters and the ESA’s Venus Express mission, which
entered Venusian orbit on 11 April 2006.
In many ways, Venus began as Earth’s close sister, perhaps even ‘twin’. Although
Venus is approximately 30% closer to the Sun than the Earth, it is similar in size,
mass, density, and volume. Venus coalesced out of the same materials as the Earth
and should have a similar bombardment history, so it is likely to have been similar

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

when the planets formed. Since life arose on Earth by 3.8 billion years ago, and
quite possibly much earlier, it is reasonable to assume that life could have arisen
on Venus during that time as well. And, if life is not indigenous to Venus, transport
from Earth or Mars during the time may have been possible (Gladman et al., 2005).
Unfortunately, reworking of the Venusian surface means that it is unlikely that we
will ever know for certain.
First Sagan (1961) and more recently Cockell (1999), Grinspoon and SchulzeMakuch and others (e.g., Schulze-Makuch et al. (2004)) have envisioned a scenario
where life could still be present on Venus. While the surface pressure and
concentration of CO2 , though high, does not prohibit life, the high temperature
does. However, in the lower and middle cloud layers of Venus, the temperatures
are lower and water vapour is available, and thus these clouds could provide a
refuge for life. Perhaps acidophilic sulphate-reducing chemoautotrophs suspended
as aerosols could survive there even today. Ultraviolet radiation ﬂux would be
high, but Schulze-Makuch et al. (2004) have suggested a way that the ﬂux could
be attenuated allowing life to survive.

6.8.2 Mars
Mars is half again as far from the Sun as the Earth. Its mass is 0.12 that of the Earth,
so there is one-sixth the gravity on the surface. As is the case for Venus, early Mars
was similar to early Earth, and therefore if life is inevitable, or even likely, under
early Earth conditions, it ought to have arisen on Mars as well. Unlike Venus, or
even Earth, preservation of early fossils is possible, and, thus, Mars is a tantalizing
target for palaeontologists.
The interest in extant life on Mars continued well into the twentieth century,
inspired in part by the discovery of canali on Mars in 1877 by Giovanni Schiaparelli
in Milan (see Zahnle (2001) for the history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century
views of the habitability of Mars). It was NASA’s Mariner IV mission, which gave
the ﬁrst close-up glimpse of the Martian surface, that ﬁnally destroyed all hope of
a civilization on Mars or even extensive vegetation. Mariner IV arrived at Mars
on 14 July 1965 and returned photos showing a heavily cratered barren landscape.
In addition, the thinness of the atmosphere was realized.
The 1960s ended on a different note with Mariner 9’s superior photos revealing
gigantic volcanoes and a grand canyon stretching 4800 km across its surface.
More surprisingly, the relics of ancient riverbeds were carved in the landscape
of this seemingly dry and dusty planet. Thus, attention turned to the possibility
of microbial life on Mars, even extant life. NASA’s Viking landers arrived at
Mars in 1976 with a variety of life detection experiments: a camera and a gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to detect organic compounds, and

three metabolic experiments: labelled release, pyrolytic release, and gas exchange.
While the approach was clever and the performance was excellent, unambiguous
signs of life were not detected. Worse, organic carbon was not detected by the
GC-MS. Lack of surface water and strong surface oxidants were suspected to be
the culprits. Attention in the exobiology community turned to the possibility of
ﬁnding signs of extinct life.
More recently, the possibility of extant microbial life has been revived. And,
whether the Mars meteorite ALH84001 indeed harbours an extinct Martian biota
(McKay et al., 1996) or has only whetted our appetite for further studies, it
remains one of the most exciting science stories of the twentieth century. The
life forms would be found in the polar ice caps, in subsurface communities, in
hydrothermal systems or in endoliths or evaporites (Rothschild, 1990). Terrestrial
analogues exist for all of these potential life forms, and all circumvent the high
ﬂux of ultraviolet radiation on the surface. Primarily for these reasons, and the
likelihood of eventual human settlement, Mars remains a prime target for missions,
if not speciﬁcally to look for life, then to better understand the environment of
the planet. By understanding the environment, habitability can be gauged. These
include NASA’s Mars Pathﬁnder, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, the Mars
Exploration Rovers, and ESA’s Mars Express. Sadly the British-designed Beagle 2
lander which was intended speciﬁcally to look for life, failed to communicate with
Mars Express after its release in December 2003, and is now presumed ‘dead’.

6.8.3 Europa
If water is the sine qua non for life, any body known to have liquid water instantly
becomes a prime target in the search for life. For years it was thought that any
body far from the Sun would not be able to harbour liquid water, but today there
are several moons beyond Mars thought to contain liquid water beneath an icy
covering. The best known of these is Europa.
Europa was discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 along with Jupiter’s other three
large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto. In 1951, using Earth-based telescopes,
H. Jeffreys proposed that Callisto might be partially or totally composed of water in
the form of ice. This was suggested by Callisto’s very low density and also its albedo.
The presence of frost or ice on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto was conﬁrmed by
using infrared reﬂectivity observed from the solar telescope at Kitt Peak National
Observatory. John Lewis (1971) and, later, others suggested that there could be a
liquid water ocean beneath an icy crust. First the Voyager spacecraft, and, since the
1990s, NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, have returned photos of ice-covered surfaces
with coloured cracks (reviewed in Greenberg and Geissler (2002) and Greenberg
(2005)). Current thinking focuses on the idea of a liquid water ocean beneath an icy

crust that is under 50 million years old, so is actively resurfacing (Khurana et al.,
2002). The ocean is maintained by tidal resonance with Io and Ganymede and tidal
friction with Jupiter.
As soon as it became known that there might be liquid water on Europa
discussions began on the possibility that there might also be life there. Guy
Consolmagno, who worked on the theoretical models of oceans on Europa,
Ganymede, and Callisto with John Lewis at MIT, included an appendix in his
1975 Master’s thesis ‘Thermal history models of icy satellites’, where he suggested
that Europa could have the beginnings of organic chemistry if the rocky core is
as rich in carbon as some of the primitive meteorites. He concluded by writing
‘. . . we stop short of postulating life forms in these mantles; we leave such to
others more experienced than ourselves in such speculations.’ Since then a dozen
or so papers have appeared with similar speculations, including Gaidos et al.
(1999), Chyba and Phillips (2002), and Greenberg (2005). While pictures of large
invertebrates prowling the Europan ocean have entered the popular imagination,
a more constrained microbial biosphere is widely discussed. Future missions,
though long and expensive compared to Mars missions, are ardently desired.

6.8.4 Enceladus
Suddenly in March 2006 there was a new body in the Solar System in the ranks of
suspected harbourers of life (Porco et al., 2006). Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn,
orbits in the outermost ring, the E ring. The Cassini mission had revealed a cloud of
oxygen in the E ring, and Enceladus was suspected to be the source. Enceladus is
thought to have an internal heat source and is geologically active, resulting in cold
geysers that throw out water vapour and ice. The water decomposes into clouds of
oxygen. Thus, there may be large pools of liquid water beneath the surface, and
where there is water, the possibility for life exists.
6.9 Conclusions
Life ‘as we know it’ — and are likely to know it — is based on organic carbon.
Furthermore, water is the solvent that supports life on Earth and, again, is likely to
be used elsewhere, although the certainty is not quite as high as the argument for
organic carbon. Based on these facts alone, environments that would be challenging
to any life form exist.
The story of the so-called extremophiles is a conglomeration of many stories
gathered for a multitude of purposes over the years. They reveal an envelope for
life that is far beyond what we could have imagined 40 or even 10 years ago. For
this reason, the potential habitats for life in the Universe have also expanded.

Some of the adaptations that organisms have made on Earth to these extreme
environments are relatively simple from an evolutionary viewpoint, whereas others
have required a suite of evolutionary changes. Particularly in the former case,
examples of convergent evolution to solve the same problem the same way are
known. Convergence suggests a relative simplicity to the adaptation, and thus
increases the likelihood that it could occur elsewhere.
While it is impossible to predict whether extremophiles will be found elsewhere,
two things are of near certainty. Terrestrial extremophiles will be among the ﬁrst
settlers of extraterrestrial bodies and the environmental limits for life presented here
will someday be extended through further exploration of extreme environments on
Earth.
