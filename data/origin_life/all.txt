The origin of terrestrial life: a Christian perspective

87

The Greek theologians had already noted the significant role played by earth in
all the makings described in Genesis 2. In contrast to the summoning into existence by an act of the Divine will described in the first chapter, the “makings”
mentioned in the second chapter (excepting that of woman) are said to be from
the earth, an earth that had just been watered and made fruitful. Augustine draws
attention to the essential role attributed here to earth and water in the first appearance of each natural kind at its appropriate moment. His proposal is that potencies,
causal possibilities, must have been implanted in the matter of the first creation,
potencies that would in due time lead to the later appearance of each kind, here
more exactly described as a fashioning from materials already at hand, unlike the
coming-to-be from nothing prior, characteristic of the first appearance of a source
of those materials.
In the Old Latin translation of the text that Augustine used, the second account
of creation begins: “This is the book of the creation of heaven and earth. When day
was made, God made heaven and earth and every green thing of the field before it
appeared above the earth.” 4 Augustine gives an elaborate construal of this passage,
noting different possible ways to read the text. The phrase that particularly caught
his attention was the reference to plants that existed within the earth before making
their appearance above ground. It provided him with a ready analogy on which he
could draw to support his more general thesis about the role of potential existence
within the earth prior to appearance in mature form when conditions were right.
How literally were analogies of this kind to be taken here? The seedlike principles are clearly not seeds in any ordinary sense. Augustine readily admits that
they are difficult for us to imagine since they are of their nature hidden from view.
Yet, as he reminds the reader, this is no different from the principle or cause that
brings about our own growing old. Such principles lie within us; though they are
inaccessible to our senses, “by another kind of knowledge we conclude that there
is in nature some hidden force by which latent forms are brought into view” [6]
(par. 27). Analogies can help: “There is, indeed, in seeds some likeness to what I
am describing because of the future developments stored up in them. Indeed, it is
the seedlike principle that is the more basic of the two, since it comes before the
familiar seeds we know” [6] (par. 11). He goes further:
In the seed, then, there was invisibly present all that would develop in time into a tree. And
in the same way we must picture the world, when God made all things together, as having
had all things that were made in it and with it when day was made. This includes not only
heaven with sun, moon and stars … but also the beings which earth produced in potency
and in their causes before they came forth in the course of time [5] (par. 45).
 Later translators have agreed in substituting for “before it appeared” something like “there was as yet no
vegetation upon the earth.”

The force of this analogy lies in the notion of potentiality: the original creation
contained within it the potentialities for all the living kinds that would later
appear. The seedlike principles were conceptually distinct from one another, but
Augustine did not think of them as distinct physical bodies that lay somehow
embedded, after the fashion of ordinary seeds, within the primal matter. They
were real, they were physical, but they did not have to occupy a specific location,
as a seed would [7].5 To assert that the seedlike principle for a particular natural
kind lay within the earth meant no more (and no less) than that the earth had conferred upon it what it would take for that natural kind to develop eventually within
it in a natural way: “All things were created by God in the beginning in a kind of
blending of the elements, but they could not develop and appear until the circumstances were favorable” [8].
It sounds as though the seedlike principle was enough of itself, once the environment was right, to produce the new kind in a natural way, that is, by virtue of
the “causal connections,” as Augustine calls them, that the Creator implanted from
the beginning within matter generally. Is this, then, what is meant by the “making”
attributed to the Creator in the second story of creation? Granted that no new act of
creation, of radical bringing-to-be, is needed, is no further, lesser, supplementation
of the causal capacities of matter on the part of the Creator required?
At times, Augustine hesitates to say so, in regard to some comings-to-be, at least.
To assert this would raise a troublesome issue: does the new kind of animal come to
be as infant or as adult? If infant, how does it survive? If as adult, the ordinary laws
of nature would not suffice to bring it about, and a further miraculous intervention
on God’s part would be needed. Augustine leaves the matter open:
In either case, whichever way God made [Adam’s body] He did what was in accordance
with His almighty power and wisdom. God has established in the temporal order fixed
laws governing the production of kinds of beings and qualities of beings and bringing them
forth from a hidden state in full view, but His will is supreme overall. By His power He
has given numbers to his creation, but He has not bound His power by these numbers [6]
(par. 13; p. 194).

The “numbers” referred to here are the laws of nature. Augustine often drew upon a
sentence from Wisdom (11:21): “Thou hast ordered all things according to measure,
number, and weight,” to describe the kind of order that the Creator imparted to the
activity of the physical world. In these chapters of the De Genesi he goes out of his
way, as he frequently does elsewhere in his theological works, to convey that God
is not bound by this order. He can depart from it by way of miracle, and this too is
 McKeough cites numerous Catholic writers, beginning with Edouard Thamiry (De rationibus seminalibus,
Paris, 1905) who debated the meaning and significance of the doctrine of seminal principles in the early part
of the twentieth century.

“natural” in the broader sense that openness to miracle is a basic trait of the natures
that the Creator brought to be.6 But Augustine makes it clear that miracle would
not ordinarily be involved for the seedlike principle to give rise to the appropriate
natural kind when “the conditions are right.” What the Creator’s “making” would
amount to in these cases would be the regular conservation in being afforded to all
creatures and their actions, ordered as they are by the “numbers” by which they have
been constituted. Still, it should be kept in mind that Augustine does allow that this
may not be sufficient when something apparently impossible is in question, like the
production directly from the earth of the adult animal body by means of the multiple
causalities conferred on matter in the beginning [2] (pp. 13–15).
It is possible now to see how the postulation of seedlike principles that enables one to speak without contradiction of an initial simultaneous “creation of all
things” goes some way towards resolving the troublesome tension between the
Genesis chapters. Chapter 1 can be taken to describe the instantaneous bringing
into existence of the primal matter, containing within it the causal resources for
all the kinds that would later appear and therefore in a real sense already present
within it. Chapter 2 follows the subsequent history of the working out in time
of these causal possibilities and the actual first appearances “from the earth” of
plants, wild beasts, and birds, a “making” that may or may not require a supplementation of the natural potentialities of matter on the Creator’s part. There
are loose ends, of course, as Augustine was the first to admit, notably in regard
to the appearance of the animal, and especially the human, body. If the seminal
principles were not sufficient of themselves to bring that appearance about, so that
some sort of supplementary action on God’s part was required, a “making” in a
stronger sense then, could one properly hold that the matter of the initial creation
already in some sense contained “all things”? Augustine tries to meet this objection by allowing a second extended sense of “seedlike principle,” but it is at best a
strained response. In what follows, the term will be used in  Augustine’s primary
sense to designate a feature of the regular causal order of the physical world, capable of bringing about the appearance of a new physical kind when the conditions
are propitious.
5.5  Genesis and On the Origin of Species
To trace the fortunes of Augustine’s account of cosmic origins through the centuries
that followed would lead far afield. A few brief remarks will have to suffice. Medieval
theologians, with whom Augustine carried more authority than any source other
 The term, “natural,” is used in this essay, however, in the more usual sense where God’s “special” action is
not involved.

than the Bible, were aware of his foray in  cosmogony. But for those who sought a
story of origins that all could understand, Genesis 1, read literally, carried undeniable attraction. Hexaemeral (“Six Day”) literature flourished, embellishing the biblical story in imaginative ways and making it the introduction to a general account
of the natural world for the Christians of that time.
For those among them who took  Aristotle as their guide, there were serious reasons to doubt the Augustinian version of origins.  Aquinas, who revered Augustine,
did his best to present the two alternatives, literal-biblical and Augustinian, as fairly
as possible [2] (pp. 16–21).7 But for an Aristotelian, the Augustinian proposal would
have held little attraction. The notion of living kinds making their first appearance
in a quasi-natural way, impelled by causal powers present since the first creation,
ran contrary to the fundamental principles of Aristotle’s physics. No such powers
had ever been discovered actually at work. Easier for a Christian Aristotelian to
call on a six-day succession of miracles in the first place: the very notion of a cosmic beginning itself had to lie outside the bounds of nature as Aristotle understood
the natural world.
The advent centuries later of the Protestant Reformation led to a heightened
emphasis on literal interpretation of the Bible among Protestants and Catholics
alike. Genesis was a favored source in cosmology. Tensions between it and
Aristotle’s physics were much debated. An interpretation that departed as far from
the literal as Augustine’s reading of Genesis 1 was not likely to win much support.
Jumping far ahead once again, this was to change, to some modest extent at least, in
the last decades of the nineteenth century. After centuries in the shade, Augustine’s
vision of  cosmogony would once more gain a modest degree of notice.
The reason, of course, was simple. In the wake of Darwin’s On the Origin of
Species, Augustine’s account offered an authentic Christian alternative to the literalist reading of Genesis that  Darwin’s work had so dramatically, and so effectively, called into question. It demonstrated that the greatest theologian of the
early Christian church did not regard the literalist reading of the six-day story of
creation as plausible, let alone obligatory. Furthermore, and even more important,
the alternative reading he suggested opened the way to a gradualist account of
cosmic ­origins. Calling on Augustine for support seems to have been particularly
­appealing to a small number of Catholic writers8 who were sympathetic to evolutionary ideas as well as to patristic precedent and who were wrestling with the

 It is quite striking that the Augustinian notion of seedlike reasons was rarely, if ever, cited among the far more
numerous Protestant writers who, in this early period, defended a broadly Darwinian, gradualist, account of
the origin of living things. See, for example, J.H. Roberts. Darwinism and the Divine in America: Protestant

prevailing literalism of the approach to Genesis among Catholic scholars. These
authors clearly expected the appeal to the Fathers of the Church to carry particular
weight.
As early as 1871, a distinguished English biologist, St. George Mivart, a defender
of evolution (though departing from Darwin’s account in significant ways), pointed
to the relevance of Augustine’s treatment of the origin of  natural kinds as opening the way, theologically speaking, for an evolutionary approach [9]. In the US,
John Zahm at the University of Notre Dame, a leading figure in the contemporary debates about the relations of science and religion, likewise underlined the
Augustinian precedent as a theological warrant for those who would see evolution
as God’s way of bringing the  natural kinds to be [10]. In 1909, a noted geologist,
Henri de Dorlodot, representing the Catholic University of Louvain, offered a tribute at a celebration in Cambridge of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of
On the Origin of Species, and went on to develop over some years a theological
defense of  Darwin that eventually appeared in book form in 1921. He analyzed a
series of patristic texts in some detail, focusing on  Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine
and concluding that “the authority of the Fathers would lead us to accept the theory
of absolute natural evolution – a theory which was formally professed, as we have
shown, by St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Augustine” [11]. And again: [St. Augustine
held] “that the theory of the absolute natural evolution of living beings is a necessary deduction from the infallible teaching of Holy Writ” [11] (pp. 87, 149). De
Dorlodot’s English translator, Ernest Messenger, went on later to publish a work of
his own carrying a similar, though more cautiously worded, message, which had a
very wide circulation in Britain and the USA [12].
The initiatives on the part of these writers, arguing for the Augustinian credentials of the notion of organic and perhaps pre-organic evolution, met with opposition, occasionally strenuous opposition on the part of Church authorities, notably
in Zahm’s case. Part of the problem was the ambiguity in what was being claimed.
When these writers claimed  Augustine’s sanction for “natural evolution,” did this
mean  Darwinian evolution? Specifically, did it extend to “transformism,” as the
view that species evolved by the transformation of earlier species was being called?
Surely, the critics argued, Augustine could not have had in mind this specifically
Darwinian innovation, involving natural selection as its agent. Augustine would
have assumed that each seedlike principle was linked one-to-one with a specific
natural kind. It would hardly have occurred to him that one kind might over the
course of time be transformed into another. With his background in  Greek philosophy, he would assuredly never have countenanced this and could call on both Plato
and Aristotle  for assurance in that regard. So it would certainly not be correct to
suggest that Augustine’s theology of seedlike principles supports Darwin’s specific
version of how organic evolution might come about.

Though this is correct, a weaker claim is still significant. Part of the problem here
is the ambiguity of the term “evolution.” Since Darwin’s time, the term has meant
only one thing for most people: evolution is what  Darwin proposed and argued for
in On the Origin of Species. When the writers mentioned above recalled Augustine’s
De Genesi as a theological precedent for “natural evolution,” what their readers
tended to take from this, even when Darwin was not specifically mentioned, was that
Augustine had already proposed a quasi-Darwinian account of the origins of living
things. This Augustine did not do, as we have seen. But what the authors meant (or
at least should have meant!) was something much broader but still significant: that
Augustine defended a gradualist account of origins, where causal resources were
already implanted in the original creation that would be sufficient, under favorable
environmental circumstances, to allow all of the profusion of plant and animal life
to make its appearance later. How this was to be achieved, how the seedlike principles would operate, Augustine quite frankly admitted that he did not know. Darwin 
has filled in that picture in ways that Augustine would have marveled at. 
But would he have welcomed it? Some might argue that his seed analogy is much
too teleological in implication to be even compatible with the Darwinian picture.
The seed, after all, must take a predetermined path as it develops into the mature
organism. There is a preset goal that will be reached if the conditions are favorable.
The zigzag path followed by natural selection could hardly be more different.
Here, once again, a reminder is needed that the seed analogy is not supposed to
be taken literally, as Augustine himself so strongly emphasized. It is no more than
a convenient comparison that works in some respects but not in others. As with
any analogy, one must ask what it was intended to bring out. The point Augustine
wanted to convey was clearly retrospective, not prospective, in intention. That is,
his point was that the causal resources, whatever they might have been, were there
right from the beginning to explain the later appearance of the different  natural
kinds. That was sufficient to enable him to hold that those kinds had themselves,
in a limited but real sense, been present (i.e. in potency) from the first moment of
cosmic beginning.
This is something that Darwinians could agree with and, indeed, in some contexts, would themselves want to emphasize. Taking the analogy in a prospective
sense was not what Augustine had in mind, however, as though he maintained that
one could predict from a knowledge of the seedlike principles what the course of
later development would be:
The principle which makes this development possible is hidden to the eyes but not to
the mind. But whether such a development must necessarily come about is completely
unknown to us. We know that the principle that makes it possible is in the very nature of
[the] body. But there is no clear evidence in that body that there is a principle by which it
must necessarily take place [6] (par. 16).

The origin of terrestrial life: a Christian perspective

93

Concluding, then, there was a firm precedent in the early Christian tradition for
the view that the six-day Genesis account of cosmic origins was not to be taken
literally and that the most satisfactory reading of it – satisfactory from both the
theological and the philosophical standpoints – was to suppose that the Creator
implanted in the original cosmic material the wherewithal for the diversity of living
things that over the ages would later make its appearance.9 So that sanctioning evolution, broadly understood as gradual development, in this way cannot be ­dismissed
as no more than a defense measure introduced post-Darwin to fend off criticism
inspired by On the Origin of Species. It has an honorable ancient lineage.

5.6  The origin of terrestrial life
It is not difficult to see what the implication of the Augustinian vision is for the
multitude of researchers engaged in solving the puzzle of how the first cells might
have come to be. It would be an emphatic: keep at it! The seedlike principles were
almost surely there from the very beginning, even though it may not be within our
reach to establish the specific causal sequence to which they gave rise in the earth
and water of long, long ago. The philosophical/scientific grounds for this confidence would not be the same today as they were for Augustine. But the theological
grounds would be in important respects the same.
What has, however, encouraged some to take this occasion to promote the special-creation alternative once again, what has, in consequence made the proper
theological response to the origin-of-life issue once more a matter of debate, has
been the problem of envisioning in scientific terms what the path might conceivably have been from the play of non-living molecules to the tight organization of
even the simplest cell. This is what led Mivart and de Dorlodot, champions otherwise of Augustine’s seedlike principles, to deny in the case of the former, and to
doubt in the case of the latter, that such a path could exist. For a time after Miller’s
discovery in 1952 of amino-acids in the residue of a simple mixing of inorganic
molecules supposedly mimicking the constitution of the primitive atmosphere of
Earth, it seemed to many that a giant step had been made along that path. But that
enthusiasm gradually evaporated as the biochemical complexity of even the most
basic cell became more and more apparent. Great strides have been made in recent
years, but significant obstacles remain. …
An alternative, of course, would be to suppose that the Creator supplemented the
normal operations of nature in this case to initiate a new stage in cosmic development. For those, however, who do not believe in the existence of a Creator, there

obviously has to have been a causal path directly from the non-living to the living,
no matter how far from being understood in terms of currently known causal possibilities this may be. For them there is no other option. Less combatively, others
would insist, on methodological grounds, that the naturalist option should continue
to be energetically pursued. And here is where debate can arise, as indeed it has:
one side maintaining that the difficulty in conceiving a “natural” path in this case
implies the need for a designer’s intervention and thus may even become an independent argument for the existence of such a designer, the other side vigorously
questioning the force of this appeal to a designer, on either metaphysical or methodological grounds.
In the context of this contemporary debate, Augustine’s doctrine of seedlike
principles takes on a real relevance. It might have seemed in advance somewhat
strained to hark back to an intellectual context so remote from ours to illuminate
a theological option that believers in a Creator, be they Christian, Jewish, Moslem,
or other, might want to call on when faced with this dispute about the origin of life.
Despite the evident difference of context, however, the theological principles that
underlay Augustine’s doctrine can be disentangled from what is no longer relevant
to them and put to good use once again today.
These principles might fairly be summarized as follows. From the Augustinian
perspective, it seems unlikely that there would be no possible way in which a transcendent Creator could impart to the original created world the capacities that
would have made possible the natural transition from non-life to life on Earth.
From this it would plausibly follow, first, that the Creator would have made those
seedlike principles part of the original cosmic endowment. And second, it would
also follow that it is appropriate for the scientist to proceed on the expectation that
life would have come to be in a manner, in principle at least, accessible to human
science. To your average scientist these might seem pretty minimal conclusions!
But in the light of recent controversy about the appropriate Christian approach to
the issue of the origin of the first life on Earth, it is not a small matter if one can
show how they fit quite comfortably into the first great  theology of creation.

The alpha and the omega: reflections on the
 origin and future of life from the perspective
of Christian theology and ethics

 Astrobiology, encompassing the search for life on other planets,  laboratory ­studies
of the origin of early life forms from precursor materials, and prospects for the
discovery of  microbial life on other planets reflects outcomes at the cutting edge of
science and  technology. Yet the issues that such investigations raise are profound,
for not only do they bear on our own sense of self in relation to the cosmos, but
they also raise deep philosophical and religious issues concerned with purpose,
meaning, and human identity. Given these profound challenges, the ethical and
moral frameworks within which such developments take place need to be carefully
considered, for outcomes of such deliberations have public and social importance
alongside a potential scientific gain. The intention of this chapter is to:
1.  analyze those philosophical and theological themes that arise in the context of the origin
of life, focusing particularly on the intersection of physical and evolutionary parameters
in the interplay of  chance and necessity, alongside debates around purpose and design;
2.  consider some of the ethical issues associated with both the origin and future of life
from a  Christian ethical perspective, including responsibility for future generations;
3.  argue for the recovery of a sense of wisdom, from both a theological perspective and
through  phronesis or  practical wisdom.

It would be impossible to do justice to the full range of possible positions that a
theologian might take in relation to theological and ethical issues raised by astrobiology. For this study, I have drawn on the work of contemporary Protestant writers, such as Arthur Peacocke, as he has been very influential in the science and
religion field. I am also convinced, however, that the medieval theologian Thomas
Aquinas, especially in his understanding of  prudence, has something useful to contribute to contemporary ethical debates. Arguments for using this method, rather

6.1  What is life?
One of the greatest challenges facing those scientists who are brave enough to enter
the difficult waters of trying to recreate the early conditions of the  solar system
before life appeared on Earth is how to move from physical molecular processes to
what might be broadly defined as “life.” The definition of life will clearly influence
those claims for or against having created “life” in a laboratory. The  definition of
life is also influenced by prior commitments to particular philosophies. A materialist, for example, will have a very different definition compared with someone who
believes that life is energized by spiritual forces. Those who adhere to mechanistic
and reductionistic philosophies believe that complex activities can be explained by
reference to molecules and their mutual interactions. In contrast, there are those
who argue that the materialist explanation is insufficient to explain emergent properties, that instead such properties become unique to the level of complexity under
study. More holistic interpretations resist mechanistic definitions in favor of more
complex functions as a requirement for life, and may even be associated with the
ancient concept of vitalism, or a “life force,” energizing life into being. While
there are some religious believers who adhere to the concept of a “life force,” this
is rejected by biologists and physicists alike, as well as those theologians who are
prepared to take the results of science seriously.
Some astrobiologists have suggested that we need to look for broad features of
life, in order to look for other non-Earth “biosignatures,” rather than associate life’s
definition with that life found on Earth [1] (p. 9). In this Popa goes further than most
astrobiologists, who seek Earth-biosignatures understood as those external conditions that make life as we know it possible on Earth. I suggest that if very different
forms of “life” were to be discovered on other planets then there would be a need
to use very different terminology that reflects its different origin and function. John
Maynard Smith and  Eörs Szathmáry are, I think, correct to state that “if we are
to distinguish between a living being and an artefact, it can only be by knowing
its history” [2]. Life requires information flow, hence it needs to store and use that
information, so that in the context of laboratory experiments to create life, it can
be distinguished from non-life by viewing that information as superimposed on
certain states of matter or energy [3].
6.2   Chance and necessity in the origin of life
Although the chance of fully functional life emerging spontaneously on Earth
is infinitely small, most scientists argue that life began through small steps that

were gradually built up over a very long time. Debates exist as to which process originated first. Was it primitive metabolic pathways? Perhaps building blocks
subsequently formed more complex molecules that enabled a membrane to encase
particular reaction centers, eventually leading to the formation of ribonucleic acid
[4]. An alternative theory is that ribozymes were the most important, in which case
ribonucleic acid also acted as enzymes for catalytic reactions [5]. The difficulty in
this case is how to arrive at complex molecules from inorganic sources. The early
experiments conducted by  Stanley Miller at the University of Chicago in the 1950s
showed how it was possible to make a wide range of amino acids as well as hydrogen cyanide when an electric spark was added to a reducing atmospheric mix of
methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor [6]. Such research confirmed previous speculations by the Russian chemist  Aleksandr Ivanovich Oparin (1894–1980)
and the British geneticist  John Haldane (1892–1964). Subsequently experimenters
found that adenine and guanine could form from hydrogen cyanide, given the right
conditions.  RNA can replicate itself in the right conditions [7]. The difficulty, of
course, is how to derive complex molecules from these relatively simple substrates,
although authors like  Thomas Cech believe that these details will be discovered
in time; more importantly, perhaps, Cech believes that life originated relatively
easily and spontaneously as a result of the chemistry of the early Earth.  He also
suggests that different forms of life with different chemistry would have arisen,
and then been extinguished, but he claims “I am much less sure that each of these
origins would have been chemically identical. … We have in our natural history
one solution that persisted” [8]. Other scientists are more in favor of life emerging on some form of solid surface, such as that of iron-sulfur pyrite. According to
this hypothesis, organic compounds attached to pyrite surfaces and then reacted to
form cellular aggregates.1
Cech’s suggestion that one form of chemical life persisted is illustrative of the
way the evolutionary paradigm has reached down to a molecular level of explanation
at the beginning of the emergence of life. He even believes that original new forms
of life are still attempting to emerge even in the contemporary context, billions
of years after life first began on Earth. Hence, he suggests that life is an intrinsic
property of small organic molecules, emerging through self-assembly, eventually giving rise to complex forms. The difficulty, of course, is the directionality
of that self-assembly towards greater and greater complexity. For example, while
self-organizing properties are a function of matter, what makes such spontaneous
self-organization shift towards greater and greater complexity? What is the source
of such tendency towards evolutionary complexity? Radu Popa suggests that seeming purposeful behavior in the evolution of life is derived from the enhancement

of energy flows that are possible in more complex systems [1] (pp. 134–135).
He strongly resists any suggestion that purposefulness is divine in origin, rather
that over time the system stabilized in such a way as to have a vectorial tendency.
This implies, of course, that life is a natural consequence of the restraints set up by
physical laws, and these drive the origin of life. However, this seems to be a tautology. It stands to reason that complex life apparently goes against the second law of
 thermodynamics towards greater entropy, but in order to obey that physical law it
must, of necessity, have enhanced energy flows. It seems unconvincing that energy
flows in themselves are responsible for shifts towards greater complexity, for each
level of organization will have its own properties distinctive for that level.
Debates about the origin of life are fascinating as they are situated at the borderland between discussions of cosmological and evolutionary theories. Physicists
have often been more prepared to bring in theistic language in order to explain the
remarkable set of coincidences that seem to have come together in order to make
the Earth a planet fit for life, one where life is physically possible at all. For the
Earth to be able to sustain life it needs to be close enough to an energy source so
that there is sufficient heat, but not so far removed that it is locked in a frozen state.
Overall, the combination of conditions found are appropriate for life as we know
it, including the range of temperatures needed for liquid water to be present. The
Earth, unsurprisingly, is situated in a “habitable zone,” and other physical properties such as gravity, the distance of the Moon from the Earth, the lifetime of the
Sun, and numerous other properties are “just right” for life to emerge. Physicists
have called such a tendency the “anthropic principle,” though more accurately it
should be named the “life principle,” for it specifies the conditions right for life to
emerge. The question remains, why did such laws emerge in the Universe in the
way they did, given the variety of other possible physical laws ?
 6.3 Is God a designer?
Given the multiple physical coincidences required to make life feasible at all, some
physicists who are theists have returned to the idea of God as master Designer.
Such ideas have been discredited historically, especially in the biological sphere,
because processes of  natural selection could explain those complex functions in
biology that seemed to point to design [9]. Where design arguments are used as
evidence for the existence of God the territory becomes even shakier, for once scientists find a biological or physical explanation, God seems superfluous to requirements. This is exactly what happened in the aftermath of Darwin to vestiges of
natural theology remaining from the previous centuries. What about the origin
of life itself? Does this suggest a master Designer in terms of molecules that are
just right for life to emerge? Or perhaps it is even illicit to make such attempts

to synthesize life, as these amount to forms of “playing God” with the order in
the Universe, dabbling with that momentous change towards life from non-life?
Debates still exist, of course, regarding whether life emerging from inorganic origins was a relatively “easy” process or highly improbable, given the particular
physical conditions at the time. It is important to scrutinize the evidence so far and
ask how far are such combinations of molecular mixes likely to have been around
in the sequence suggested. Some biologists believe that the combination of events
needed is sufficiently unlikely to be highly improbable, amounting almost to a
“miraculous” understanding of life’s origins, and in this sense, not really definitive
as far as science is concerned [10]. Other scientists working in the field are more
likely to be confident that a solution will be reached, and that over time they will
be able to fill in the gaps in the knowledge of how life began. All scientists aim
to arrive at a naturalistic explanation, but such a search should not be threatening
to theists. In fact, one might argue that if a full explanation was reached, then this
would in some ways serve a theological agenda, as it would effectively remove
any sense that God intervenes at the start of the process (non-life to life) and then
leaves it to organize itself to greater complexity through the processes of natural
evolution. The latter view amounts to Deism, that is, God is simply one who starts
off the process in the beginning.
How can we envisage God acting in such circumstances? Perhaps the most helpful way of viewing God is to envisage God as the foundation of all Being, including the foundation of physical and biological laws. Arthur Peacocke suggests that
a rewriting of the book of Genesis needs to include the idea of the origin of life,
so that following a survey of the way the Earth has come into being according to
cosmology he suggests that “in some wet deep crevice, or pool, or deep in the sea,
just over three billion years ago some molecules became large and complex enough
to make copies of themselves and become the first specks of life” [11] (p. 1). Is this
way of re-reading Genesis necessarily helpful, except in a metaphorical sense by
contrast with the original text? This first book of the Bible was never intended to be
a story about early cosmology, but rather a story written in order to affirm Israelite
faith in a God who acts decisively in history in contrast to the prevalent Babylonian
creation myths whose gods struggled with evil in the creation of the world. The
God as envisaged in the Biblical account is a God who affirms the goodness of the
material world and is the author of all that is. Belief in God as Creator was assumed
by the early Israelites; hence the creation story in Genesis reminded believers that
God was Lord of their history, a history that was rooted in the beginning of the
creation of the world. The Genesis text speaks of life as a gift of God to all of creation, and to humanity in particular, being made in the image of God. While the title
of Peacocke’s book might imply that he supports natural theology, i.e. arguments
for God’s existence from reflection on the natural world, he is ready to admit that

any hints at God’s presence as discerned in science are only partial and fallible
[11] (p. 127). The best we might say, perhaps, is that such scientific discoveries clear
the way for the acceptance of theism, rather than point to theism itself.
Peacocke is correct, in my view, to resist any notion of “Intelligent Design,”
that is, the view that given the complexity of molecular pathways in the emergence
of life, it must have been created all at once [11] (p. 69). These notions of special
creation hark back to the earlier natural theologies in unhelpful ways, resurrecting
a concept that is both naïve theologically and scientifically. In such circumstances
even contemporary natural theologies of  Intelligent Design become matters for
historical curiosity as to their social and public significance, rather than their intellectual achievement. The reaction against such a move is to ignore theological
engagement with the natural world altogether, but such problems can be avoided by
reinstating the notion of a theology of nature that views any notions of “design” as a
sequel to faith, rather than its anticipation. Perhaps Peacocke is a little too confident
that all the answers to the early origin of life have been discovered through principles of self-organization. It seems to me that there are far more gaps in scientific
understanding than he implies, but this does not open the window for more spurious notions of Intelligent Design. 
The question that needs to be addressed in such a context is how God can be
envisaged as continually active in the cosmos without intervening in a way that
contravenes natural physical laws as understood according to contemporary science. Keith Ward believes that evolution by natural selection is too precarious a
process to account for its directionality [12]. What about the biological phenomenon of  convergence? According to this view different species that have developed along very different evolutionary paths have seemingly come up with the
same functional solution to a particular problem, even though the genetic basis
may be very different [13]. Such convergence  also suggests constraints within the
biological processes that are not amenable to purely physical explanations, though
precisely how these restraints are derived is a matter of further research. To envisage God as simply the creator of these physical or biological laws seems too paltry
an explanation, rather God could be envisaged as resonating with life, luring life
towards a particular future as affirmed by God. This resonance is perhaps on a different plane of reality than that discovered by science. This is not vitalism, as the
latter assumes that a “life force” is required in the biological explanation of reality.
Rather, this is viewing life from a theological as well as a biological point of view.
I have suggested that this resonance of God with the created world might be named
as God’s Wisdom.2

Wolfhart Pannenberg argues in Towards a Theology of Nature that a theology
of nature needs to relate nature in its entirety to God, which includes a scientific
understanding of natural processes [14] (p. 73). Note that he used the term theology
of nature, i.e. a theological reflection on the significance of nature, unlike natural
theology, i.e. an argument for God from contemplation of nature, often associated
with God as designer. Contemporary theologians, reluctant to “burn their fingers,”
have avoided dealing with the subject of nature. Pannenberg views any concept of
ordered fixed regularity of the Universe as resting on mistaken Greek notions of
the cosmos. Instead he suggests that the Hebrew notion of God is one that stresses
the contingency of divine will. He asks if contingent occurrences in some sense
also disclose regularity. The “laws” of physics, he suggests, need to be considered
under the category of contingency, for “only in this way would it be convincing that
the order of the laws of nature on its part also is comprehended by the thought of
creation and is not opposed to it” [14] (p. 79). In other words, the historical experience of Israel is of a God who acts powerfully in the midst of contingent events,
so that while connections in occurrences arise, these only become visible from the
end. Hence, he excludes the idea of purposefulness that directs everything from
the beginning, for he believes that such forms of purposefulness amount to a loss
of contingency. At the same time he does allow for “partial development tendencies within the total process” [14] (p. 83). Of course, his position means that in
some sense the new enters from ahead, rather than from the past, so that forms are
“overformed” by the new, rather than broken by them. This view is also implicit
in his suggestion that the direction in evolution towards greater complexity comes
through “field effects,” rather than being implicit within the evolving species themselves [14] (p. 47). The concept of field effects seem to be taken from scientists who
are on the more speculative end of the spectrum, and in the biological sphere at
least, are not very convincing. 
 6.4 Ethical issues in the origin and future of life
What are the ethical issues associated with the origin-of-life experiments? So far
the attempts to recreate life in the laboratory have been a painstaking affair, with
initial concerns about  contamination from existing microbial life forms interfering with the results. It therefore seems highly improbable that any fragile life so
created would itself serve as a source of  contamination for existing life, though
presumably if a highly robust form of self-replicating molecules was created, then
this would generate some ethical concerns. Nanotechnology, which takes advantage of the molecular level of chemical interactions, could potentially produce such
autocatalytic self-replicating systems that would not be classified as  “life” by most
definitions, but might serve to generate environmental or health risks in the wrong

contexts, or even possibly be used inappropriately in terrorist attacks. Hence, if the
process could lead to a disruption of the natural world in which we find ourselves,
then it needs to be monitored very carefully, especially if that multiplication cannot
be adequately controlled.
I have argued above that attempts to create life should not be seen as a threat,
rather they need to be welcomed as a way of removing the last traces of either a
false deism, where God simply starts the process off and leaves it to evolve itself,
or a false  argument from design, where the intricacy of life encourages a belief
that the first creative act in the evolution of life was a miraculous intervention
by God. Both of these generate forms of theology that are naïve. Nonetheless,
if humanity does discover a way of creating life, such a discovery needs to be
used responsibly, with due account of the application of any such research. In
addition, the overall budget expenditure on such research needs to be appropriate, and reflect both the gain in knowledge that this will bring, and the practical
advantages. All aspects of research are now heavily competitive, and it is often
tempting for scientists who are committed to a particular research project to exaggerate or even distort the benefits for humanity in order to win public support and
funding. This tendency is ultimately a disservice for the science community, for
it ultimately leads to mistrust when the purported benefits are not forthcoming in
the way originally projected.
The above also relates to the importance of intention when discerning whether
an action is ethical or not. Hence, it is not enough just to decide whether a particular action is technically feasible, but why do the scientists want to do the research
in the first place? Is it going to serve not only their career interests, or satisfy curiosity, but is it also going to contribute to the public good in some way? Of course,
there needs to be a place for more theoretical research that has, at first sight, little
or no practical application. Yet where public money is being used in order to fund
a major project, then that funding needs to be publicly accountable in the light of
expenditure on other areas of concern to the human community. In addition, the
outcome in terms of public good needs to be inclusive of environmental values that
should inform the way research is conducted. It is, I suggest, inappropriate and irresponsible to litter stellar space or other planets with debris from failed attempts at
space exploration. Hence, suggestions to set up conservation areas within ­planetary
space are to be welcomed [15]. Perhaps one of the drives towards  terraforming
Mars and other planets is less about the very long-term future of millions of years
before the Earth ceases to be habitable, and more about trying to find a technological solution to runaway exploitation of the Earth’s resources. Searching for ways
of  terraforming other planets should not, in other words, serve to weaken human
ethical responsibility for this Earth, and attempts to conserve biodiversity on Earth,
as well as other natural resources.

In this I would support ideas that argue for the intrinsic goodness for the Earth
and the Universe as such, rather than confining the concept of the good to the
human community alone. Such an affirmation follows from Christian belief in
God as Creator of the Universe, so that there is a sense that all that is, is good. It
might be tempting for theologians to drop the notion of God as Creator, given the
naturalistic explanations of the origin of the Universe, alongside ­pseudo-scientific
assertions by  Creationists and those who adhere to Intelligent Design. I suggest that the Genesis account is not so much a story about how the Earth and
the Universe came into being, but ways of valuing that Universe in the light of
the involvement of God in the human story. The material world is not evil, as the
Manicheans thought, who supposed that spiritual Enlightenment comes through
detachment from the created world in which we live. Rather, Christian belief in the
incarnation of God in the material world in Christ reinforces the Hebrew notion
of the world declared good in the beginning of the creation of the world. Given
the goodness of the created world, it follows that actions that serve to destroy or
deface it are to be resisted. Would introducing life on Mars change the goodness
of Mars as a pristine environment where no life has previously existed? Does a
lifeless world have value?
Those who argue for the intrinsic worth of those outside the human community
have sometimes been accused of giving equal worth to all aspects of the natural
order, and of not being able to discriminate between them. I would suggest that it
is possible to hold to the notion of intrinsic value, while also being able to discriminate between different forms of life and non-life in terms of their worth. Only
those who hold that the entire world is sacred would suggest that it is untouchable,
and cannot be changed at all from its original ordering. A more helpful theological
approach is to understand the world as sacrament, that is, one that points to God
for those of faith. In this scenario, effecting change in the world is permitted, but
not indiscriminately. Dilemmas about how far to change planetary space need to
be considered in the light of the experience of human intervention on the Earth.
Many of the changes introduced on the Earth had unforeseen consequences, even
though they were done with the best of intentions at the time. Some of these consequences were accidental in this sense, though others have been carried out even
while knowing what the environmental consequences might be.
According to the Christian tradition, it would be impossible to eradicate the
human propensity for sin; hence the possibility of deliberate acts of environmental destruction on other planets cannot be ruled out. The experience of how the
Earth has been treated, in spite of the knowledge of what one should do needs to
be taken into account.  Mary Midgley argues that our lack of responsibility for the
Earth in spite of knowing what to do arises from an individualistic and competitive
philosophy, fueled by notions arising from socio-biology that seem to support an

ethic based on self-interest [16]. Much of the futurist projections by those writing
about  terraforming other planets fail to take this into account, and hence project an
unrealistic picture of harmony and cooperation between peoples in the process of
colonization. Given the timescale that is available for exploring space, according
to estimates of the lifespan of the Earth, and the human propensity for mistakes,
either deliberate or unintended, it would make sense to make any such changes
very carefully and slowly. Midgley argues that we need to regain a vision of the
Earth as the community in which humanity is situated, and learn the lesson of
cooperation by reflection on the planet in terms of  James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that the planet is only fit for life because of the activity
of the biota, hence it is not simply a matter of life adapting to the Earth, but life
changing the environmental conditions to make it fit for life. Moving living things
into inhabitable planets would take this one step further, as it would amount to
shifting a planet that is dead to one that is “living.” Of course, there is some debate
as to how far Gaia is operative as a living organism, and I would resist ideas that
imply Gaia has any  teleology or consciousness in the way that is sometimes suggested. In addition, far from giving us an example of cooperation, Gaia could be
interpreted as fostering the heightened value of microbial life, as these organisms
are primarily responsible for atmospheric stabilization. I am less convinced than
Midgley  appears to be that a vision of Gaia is of any assistance in formulating an
ethical basis for cooperative behavior. I will argue below that the virtue of  prudence, which looks to the common good, is required for this kind of complex decision making where there are multiple and competing interests.
Given that these changes will need to be made slowly and over a long timescale,
a further ethical consideration that needs to be borne in mind is our responsibility
for future generations. Rachel Muers has discussed the question of responsibility
towards future generations in a helpful article in connection with current environmental problems [17]. Some of this discussion is relevant to particular questions about environmental issues in terraforming other planets and solar systems.
Discussion of the responsibility to future generations in a modern context is related
to our ability to change the conditions possible for human existence by our impacts
on the external environment. Does exploitation of other planets and creation of new
human communities represent a radical break with the past, a moving into a new
human future that is unprecedented, in such a way that those future persons will
barely recognize themselves in their historical antecedents? Or is it a continuum
with respect to human history as humanity has always and will continuously press
towards a goal of progress? Is it a destabilization of what it means to be human
or not? The conditions for social existence are likely to break down where there
is environmental collapse on Earth, but where other planets become our home
there is the additional risk of alienation of humanity from itself. Moreover, any

extra-planetary environmental pollution event would be much harder to contain if
the environmental conditions were themselves dependent on  artificial life support
systems.
While there is an intuitive sense that we have responsibilities towards future generations, this clashes with the difficulty of giving any such future persons rights, or
other contractual means of having a relationship with those existing in the present.
It is one area where rights language comes up against its own limits, reciprocity
is impossible, and we reach a point where most philosophers would argue that it
makes little sense in speaking about “possible” persons as being objects of ethical
concern as expressed in the language of rights. Of course, in reproductive biology
“possible persons” as embryos have become objects of rights language, but the two
situations are different, for, short of freezing such embryos for another generation, discussion about future generations represents persons that have not yet even
begun to come into existence. Does a communitarian philosophy fare any better in
helping us decide about ethical responsibilities towards future generations? Muers
argues that it does not, for a community is itself bounded by particular limitations, including its propensity to break down and its inability to secure indefinite
­continuity [17]. But the intuition remains that there is a sense that we need some
way of taking into account the needs of future generations in arriving at ethical
decisions that are likely to be long term. Muers argues that secular philosophy has
failed to address ethical responsibility in this respect; it has reached its “limit.”
Theological ethics, by introducing the notion of the transcendent, offers a way of
reflecting on timeless values and shared meanings that actually makes consideration about future ­generations more relevant for ethical  concern.
6.5  Astrobiology and the search for wisdom
I will argue in this section that theology has a distinctive voice in these debates,
not only by recovering a sense of wisdom, but also in practical decision ­making
through the notion of  prudence, or practical wisdom [18]. Wisdom as a virtue in
the classic theological tradition is distinguished from prudence, for wisdom is also
one of the intellectual virtues of theoretical reason, along with understanding and
science. While prudence is wisdom in human affairs, wisdom pure and simple
surpasses this as it aims directly at God, at knowledge of divine things. It has the
facility to act as “judge” over all the sciences, both in the conclusions and premises.
For the secular scientist the failure to know is a simple result of the ­failure of
human reason. For Thomas  Aquinas, while we can know the relationship between
things and our minds, we can never penetrate fully into the mind of God, for “it
is too rich to be assimilated completely, it eludes the effort to comprehend it” [19].
Hence the unknowability of creation stems from the fact that God creates it. As

such creation only gives an imperfect picture of what God is like, we cannot ­simply
read off God from the world in the manner implied by much contemporary science
and religion writing. In addition, our minds are too crude an instrument to fathom
the true nature of things; hence it is also because human beings are created that
they cannot know fully the divine mind in things. Such a view does not lead to
agnosticism, because it presupposes the idea of a Creator, but an awareness that we
are always “on the way.” Nor does it lead to a rejection of science, for even in its
imperfect form creation shows the light of God as if it were in a mirror. How can
we best describe this search for knowledge that is also a search into the mind of
God? I suggest that such a search can be described in terms of wisdom. For wisdom
is also an expression of the eternal mind of God, while at the same time affirming
what can be known in creaturely existence. For  Aquinas science is distinct from
the gift of wisdom in that science is about the certitude of judgment that arises out
of human or created things, while wisdom is judgment about the highest cause,
namely God.
Prudence, or practical wisdom for  Aquinas is the “mother” of all the other
­cardinal virtues. It might be hard to imagine that prudence is in any sense a prerequisite to goodness, since prudence in colloquial use implies a hesitation, or even
small-minded concerns about oneself. In contrast, the classical approach links prudence specifically with goodness, moreover there is no justice or courage without
the virtue of prudence. Instinctive inclinations towards goodness become transformed through prudence, so that prudence gives rise to a perfected ability to make
choices. Hence the free activity of humanity is good in so far as it corresponds to
the pattern of prudence. Drawing on memory and experience, prudence has the
facets of taking counsel, judging correctly and then moving to act in a certain
way. Prudence also includes practical execution of what has been decided upon. It
seems to me that the holistic task of prudence that serves to inform moral behavior
is vitally important, for it invites self-reflection at every stage in the overall process
from deliberation through to action. This applies in a particularly poignant way in
astrobiology, where discussions about what should be done are taking place even
prior to the possibility of their actual technical achievement. There are also no
absolutes in prudence, so that there will always be a small measure of risk in any
decision making, even if this decision is a prudent one.
Prudence demands openness to others in a way that prevents it from being individualistic, for taking counsel is the first part in the overall process of prudential
activity. Those who are prudent take counsel and are “well advised.” Such a characteristic is relevant in the present context, which is seeking to integrate different
ways and approaches and arrive at provisional conclusions that are of fundamental
significance for the future of life. In a similar way Aquinas believes that sound
judgment is a subsidiary or “allied” virtue to prudence [20] (p. 51.3). In the context

of astrobiology, we need to ask, what might “sound judgment” mean? The gift of
science can be related to the judging activity in prudence, just as the deliberating
activity is related to the gift of counsel. In as far as a person comes to know God
through created things, this is the office of the gift of science, but the judgment
of created things in the light of divine things is the gift of wisdom. This distinction is of great interest in the light of attempts by scientists to find God through
cosmology. Thomas would suggest that such intimations of divine reality are the
result of the gift of science, but while science might give knowledge as to what one
might believe, wisdom affords a deeper relationship with God in a way that science
cannot. Hence, he is able to qualify both the provision and the limits of scientific
knowledge.
I suggest that accurate cognition at the first stage of prudential activity is not
easily acquired, but comes gradually through patient effort in experience, one that
cannot be short-circuited by an appeal to “faith” or a particular “philosophical”
view. This silent contemplation of reality that takes counsel in all kinds of ways
also includes the ability to be true to memory, meaning not just the recollection
of the past, but one that is true to the nature of things. Aquinas lists the various
components of prudence as memory, insight or intelligence, teachableness, acumen
(solertia), reasoned judgment, foresight, circumspection and caution [20] (p. 49).
Beyond this Aquinas distinguishes between individual prudence, aimed at the good
of the individual, domestic prudence for family life and political prudence, aimed
at the common good (p. 47.11). Relating the three aspects of prudence, individual,
domestic, and political, is particularly significant in an ethics of astrobiology that
includes decision making at all levels, from the individual decision of particular
scientists, through to political decision making about funding and so on.
Aquinas distinguishes between imprudence, negligence, and sham prudence.
Different types of imprudence are a result of imperfections at any stage in the process of deliberation, judgment, and action. If there is a failure to take counsel, this
leads to foolish haste, if there is a failure in judgment this leads to thoughtlessness,
if there is a failure to carry out an action this leads to inconstancy. Flaws at any
stage of taking counsel, judging, and action lead to analogous vices. Imperfections
of prudence at the first stage of cognition come about through a failure to be still
in order to perceive reality. At the root of all these vices lies unchastity, that is
the failure to be detached from the seduction of pleasures of sense [20] (p. 53.6).
Prudence as a virtue overcomes this vice in allowing reasoning to order the moral
life. Aquinas associated the vice of curiositas with magic, an addiction to the sense
of pleasure from knowing. It is a desire to know that becomes obsessive and eclipses
other human responsibilities. Given the fascination of astrobiology and its potential to arouse the imagination, there is always this implicit danger, namely that it
will become detached from more practical issues and responsibilities on Earth.

The virtue that needs to be cultivated instead is studiositas, a love of learning and
knowledge that has its proper place. Yet another implicit danger in considering the
future of life on other planets is the mode of imprudence expressed as thoughtlessness, acting too quickly without sufficient time for consideration. Like the subsidiary virtues of prudence, such as well-advisedness, negligence is a subsidiary
outcome of imprudence. Those who fail to act at all by irresoluteness are also lacking perfected prudence, as are those who cannot act in unexpected circumstances,
who lack what is known as solertia (acumen) or clear sighted objectivity in the face
of the unexpected. Given the nature of unknowns in space exploration, the virtue
of solertia is vitally needed in order to act in an ethically responsible way. Sham
prudence is prudence directed to the wrong end, namely “the flesh” set up as the
final goal of the human life. If the real goal of a particular project is to make financial gains and exploit other planets, regardless of the life forms that they bear, this
would be a form of sham prudence. Sham prudence also comes through using false
or deceitful means, namely cunning, to attain either a good or evil end. The underlying sin in the case of sham prudence is covetousness, the desire to have what is
not rightfully one’s own. This tendency would exist where there are exaggerated
claims for success in order to win public support and funding, as mentioned above.
While it is difficult, given the multifaceted nature of prudence, to do justice to it
through a simple definition, Pieper has come close through his summary of many
aspects of prudence in the following paragraph:
It holds within itself the humility of the silent, that is to say, of unbiased perception, the
trueness to being of memory, the art of receiving counsel, alert, composed readiness for
the unexpected. Prudence means studied seriousness and, as it were, the filter of deliberation, and at the same time the brave boldness to make final decisions. It means purity,
straightforwardness, candor and simplicity of character, it means standing superior to the
utilitarian complexities of mere “tactics” [21] (p. 36).

Given this understanding of prudence, such a task would be almost impossible
given the propensity to err (sin) in all its varied facets without Aquinas’s belief that
perfection in prudence is only possible through the grace of God. The form of prudence to which the Christian aspires is prudence in the light of the three theological
virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Prudence as learned and prudence perfected by
grace both move from cognition through to decision, volition, and action. This is
where the virtue of prudence as learned links with the theological virtues of faith,
hope, and love. Commentators on prudence in Aquinas seem to have ignored the
possibility of prudence acting under the influence of God’s grace, it has proved
to be an embarrassment to modern readers, preferring to align themselves with
secular concepts of prudence. However, if  Christian ethics is to move beyond a
simple endorsement of secular models, then some sense of the possibility at least

of prudence given by grace is not only necessary, but vital in thinking through
difficult ethical questions. Such a rich understanding of prudence when combined
with love of God in charity leads to a higher plane of prudence, one that is detached
from the compulsions of worldly desires. This does not come from human judgment about the world, such disdain would stem from arrogance and pride. Rather,
it is the overwhelming love of God that relativizes all human efforts, while at the
same time holding a clear perspective on human obligation and responsibility. I
prefer to call this form of prudence wisdom, since it can be more readily identified
as a theological category [22].
Unlike approaches within  Christian ethics that refer to particular traditions or
principles that seem unrelated to practical contexts, prudence demands full encounter with experience, including the experience of science, taking time to perceive
what is true in the natural world. While Aquinas restricted his idea of taking counsel to other human subjects, in an environmental context it is essential to try as far
as possible to perceive from the perspective of all creatures, all of whom are loved
by God and under God’s providence. Hence, any discussion of the future of life
needs to include not just what is good for humanity, but also what might be good for
other creatures that share our planetary home. Prudence is also helpful in discriminating between different life forms in terms of their relative intrinsic value. The
role of microorganisms in stabilization of the planet might warn against too hasty
a dismissal of microbial life as being of lesser value than higher life forms, though
evolutionary complexity is indicative of a greater sentience and consciousness that
needs to be taken into account.
Consequentialist approaches to the ethics of nature have sought to frame decisions in terms of costs and benefits, or risks. While prudence would include some
perception of risks where they are known, the ability to have accurate foresight
depends on how far such decisions promote the overall goal of prudence towards
goodness. In other words, it is the character of the agents that is as important as the
particular consequences of individual decisions made. Hence, the good of humanity is included along with the goods of other creatures. While those who are not
Christian will be able to identify with the goal of goodness, a Christian virtue ethic
springing from prudence will seek to move to a particular understanding of goodness, one that coheres with the overall goodness for creation, as well as goodness
for humanity.
A discussion of the significance of prudence  for ethical decision making about
the future of life would not be complete without brief mention of the cardinal virtue
of justice. Justice is often split off from a consideration of virtue ethics, as it is more
commonly associated with rule-based ethics. I suggest, alternatively, from the side
of virtue ethics, that when considered as a virtue to be developed justice gives consideration of rules and principles a proper place in an overall ethical framework.

Justice is concerned broadly with the idea that each is given her/his due. Unlike
many other virtues, justice specifically governs relationships with others, and also
unlike other virtues it is possible to act justly without necessarily having a proper
attitude towards that action. A particular rule or pattern for prudence prescribes
what is a just deed according to reason, and if this is written down it becomes law.
Consideration of the legal framework to protect life on other planets needs to be
considered in any international treaty set up in order to regulate space exploration
and colonization. The jus gentium is constituted by natural reason and shared by all
people, equivalent to what we might today term international law.

6.6  Conclusions
I have argued that scientific questions at the beginning of life on Earth still fall short
of full explanation as to what might have happened in the earliest history of the
Earth. From the perspective of Christian theology any discovery of natural causes
for the shift towards life from organic molecular precursors would be welcomed, as
it would remove any vestiges of deism or theories of Intelligent Design that are far
removed from a theology of nature. I have suggested that attempting to derive God
from gaps in our understanding of the nature of functional complexity either at the
start of life or throughout evolutionary change is mistaken. Theology is important,
however, in as much as from the perspective of faith it can give meaning to the directionality of evolution, challenging the notion of purposelessness that is implicit
in much evolutionary philosophy. There are also theological questions about the
meaning of humanity and humanity’s future raised by our search for other planetary homes. I have argued that from the perspective of Christian theology all of creation needs to be viewed as good, given as a gift of God, though not necessarily for
human instrumental use, but good in its own right. Where there is conflict between
ethical demands between species, or between different life forms, then the virtue of
prudence or practical wisdom is especially relevant. Prudence includes deliberation,
judgment, and action, hence it includes elements of scientific forms of reasoning,
but seeks to go beyond this by seeking a more holistic approach to complex issues.
A Christian virtue approach to the ethics of future life is, it seems to me, a more
satisfying way of reasoning compared with principled approaches that can seem
detached from secular discussion, or consequentialist approaches that view decision
making simply in terms of risks and benefits. Above all, as a human community, we
should not give up on the search for wisdom, for wisdom allows an integration of
religious and scientific ways of thinking about the Universe in a way that can inform
future visions. Such visions need to be derived from a settled sense of meaning and
identity that comes from knowing one’s place in the cosmos, rather than a desperate
search for cosmic immortality that resists human finitude.

Philosophical, Ethical, and Theological Perspectives
Where did we come from? Are we alone? Where are we going? These are the
questions that define the field of astrobiology. New discoveries about life on Earth,
the increasing numbers of extrasolar planets being identified, and the technologies
being developed to locate and characterize Earth-like planets around other stars,
are continually challenging our views of nature and our connection to the rest of
the universe.
In this book, philosophers, historians, ethicists, and theologians provide the perspectives of their fields on the research and discoveries of astrobiology. A valuable
resource for graduate students and researchers, the book provides an introduction
to astrobiology, and explores subjects such as the implications of current originof-life research, the possible discovery of extraterrestrial microbial life, and the
possibility of altering the environment of Mars.

Astrobiology in a societal context
Constance M. Bertka

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

1.1  Introduction
In 2003 the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Program
of Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion, invited over twenty scholars from
diverse fields, scientists active in astrobiology, as well as philosophers, historians,
ethicists, and theologians, to explore together the philosophical, ethical, and theological implications of research and discoveries in astrobiology. A major motivation
for this effort was the recognition that the very questions that define astrobiology as
a discipline – Where do we come from? Are we alone? Where are we going? – are
multidisciplinary in nature and have broad appeal to the public-at-large.
It is unavoidable that the science of astrobiology will intersect with, and inevitably challenge, many deeply held beliefs. Exploration possibilities, particularly those
that may include the discovery of extraterrestrial life, will continue to challenge us
to reconsider our views of nature and our connection to the rest of the universe.
Much work has already been done in this area.1 What is unique about our present
circumstance is that past theoretical musings may soon benefit from a renewed
urgency that is awakened both by new discoveries and by technological advances.
Many of the astrobiologists assembled for this workshop have in common another
interest, working proactively to provide more opportunities for non-scientists to
both share in the excitement of this field, and to be informed participants in a public dialogue that considers the opportunities and challenges associated with astrobiology in the near future. With that goal in mind participants were asked that their
work together have a pragmatic focus on the implications of, for example, current
 origin-of-life research, the discovery of  extraterrestrial microbial life in the  solar
 See, for example, S. J. Dick. Plurality of Worlds: The Origins of the Extraterrestrial Life Debate from
Democritus to Kant (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982).

system (in contrast to the implications of contact with extraterrestrial intelligent
life), and the possibility of  terraforming Mars.
The astrobiologists who participated in the workshops were charged with laying
the groundwork for each topical discussion by presenting a review of the work of
their field in a manner that would be accessible to scholars outside of their field.
These scientific presentations were followed by presentations that reflected on the
topic from a philosophical, ethical, theological or historical perspective. The perspectives included here are not intended to be exhaustive and the volume is skewed
toward Christian theological responses. Given the religious demographics in this
country (see below) that focus is understandable. Hopefully future work will serve
to broaden the dialogue.
Following the general astrobiology themes, the three workshop topics explored
were the “Origin of Life,” the “Extent of Life,” and the “Future of Life,” all with
the pragmatic focus noted above. The workshops were held over a two-year period
and the majority of participants attended all three. This level of commitment and
interest in the series enabled a progressively rich and ongoing level of dialogue to
take place among the participants. This volume has certainly benefited from that
extended dialogue. The chapters collected here were prepared in light of those
discussions and each was reviewed by at least one workshop participant outside of
the author’s field of expertise. A general summary of the key points of each of the
three parts of the volume is presented below. I also offer my own thoughts on the
unique contributions that astrobiology may bring to the scientific community as it
works at fostering a positive relationship between science and society, particularly
here in the United States.
1.2   Astrobiology and public engagement
As a scientific discipline, astrobiology works from the assumption that the origin
and evolution of life can be accounted for by natural processes, that life could
emerge naturally from the physical materials that make up the terrestrial planets. Whether or not life will be a rare or common occurrence on other terrestrial
planets is yet to be determined. However, with the growing number of extrasolar
planets being discovered, and the development of technologies and missions to specifically search for Earth-like planets, we are progressing ever closer to determining how common or rare  life is in the universe [1]. For the time being the greatest
possibility of discovering past or present life on a planet other than Earth probably
lies with our exploration of Mars. Indeed the focus of Mars exploration has been to
understand the history of water on Mars, as the assumption is that this history will
be intimately linked to the history of life on Mars, if life has ever been there or is
present there now.

Astrobiology in a societal context

The focus on water reflects the decision to  search for life “as we know it.” The
only life we currently know of is the life found on Earth, and for the scientific community the shared common ancestry of all Earth life, and its astounding diversity,
is explained by the  theory of evolution. The work of astrobiology, at its very core, is
fueled by the theory of evolution. However, the dubious position that science holds
with at least half of the American public is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than
by the controversy over the teaching of evolution in this country.
A survey by the  Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (2005) [2] revealed
that 42% of those surveyed believe that “life has existed in its present form since
the beginning of time” (pp. 7–11). This answer persists nearly 150 years after the
publication of  Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, the landmark work
in which Darwin proposed that living things share common ancestors and have
“descended with modification” from these ancestors through a process of  natural selection [3]. Perhaps even more distressing is the fact that these numbers
have not changed in decades, despite the astounding advancements in science
that have resulted over this same time period, i.e. from space exploration, both
manned and robotic, to sequencing the  human genome and imaging the brain in
action. Knowledge about the physical world gained through science has certainly
increased, but at least half the public is failing when it comes to science literacy,
or at least evolution literacy.
It may appear that the other half is doing a bit better, after all 48% reported that
“life has evolved over time,” but only 26% of those were willing to credit natural
selection as the process responsible [2] (p. 7). At least 18% of this group, who preferred “evolution guided by a supreme being” might welcome the latest challenge to
evolution, the so-called  Intelligent Design theory or ID. The basic premises behind
ID are that some structures or processes associated with life are irreducibly complex, or are evidence of complex specified information, both of which imply that an
intelligent designer is responsible for their production, and that evolution through
 natural selection simply could not have done the job.2 An astounding majority of
those surveyed, 64%, regardless of their own acceptance or rejection of evolution,
feel that both evolution and  creation science or ID should be taught in the public
science classroom because that is the “fair” solution [2] (p. 10) . How will these
facts bear on the usefulness of astrobiology as a tool for encouraging a US public
to share in the excitement of scientific discovery and be informed participants in a
public dialogue concerning next steps? The answer, I believe, depends in large part
on whether or not astrobiology as a discipline has something unique to offer society
when it comes to working on the relationship between science and religion. We

know precisely where the evolution illiteracy problem is rooted, in the  2005 Pew
survey quoted above when people were asked “to identify the biggest influence
on your thinking about how life developed,” the response chosen most frequently,
42%, was “my religious beliefs” [2] (p. 10). Before considering how astrobiology
might contribute to public engagement issues, we must first turn to a brief review
of the religious landscape in the United States.
A few years ago I accepted an invitation to speak at a local meeting of the
Secular Humanist Association. The group was interested in the general topic of
science and religion, and more specifically, why the American Association for the
Advancement of Science sponsored a program of Dialogue on Science, Ethics,
and Religion. The secular humanists were puzzled by the fact that the scientific
community would even put energy into engaging religious communities. As our
discussion continued, it became clear to me that this group viewed religion as a
relic on its way out and contributed its demise in large part to the success of science in revealing “the truth.” Clearly one of the ideological roots of this group was
the secularization theory. Simply put, this theory holds that as society becomes
increasingly modernized and secular, religious belief, and the influence of religious
institutions, will decline. The theory was a popular one with sociologists of religion
in the 1960s but has now largely been abandoned because it is not supported by
the empirical data [4, 5]. If secularization is not on the rise, how has the religious
landscape, particularly in the USA, but also globally, changed?
A 2005 survey conducted by the  Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion and the
Department of Sociology at Baylor University directly addresses the question in
terms of American piety [6]. The goal of the Baylor Religion Survey is to understand
religion in America. It is a work in progress with additional surveys to be conducted
over the next several years. Initial results speak directly to the question of secularization. The survey’s authors note that previous national studies seemed to indicate
that over the past quarter century there was an increase in the percentage of the
population subscribing to no religion, rising from 8% to over 14%. However, they
note that these previous studies asked people to identify their religious affiliation
based on a list of possible dominations. Given the growth in non-denominational
congregations, as well as congregations that do not emphasize their denominational
identity, the authors suspected that this type of survey may have incorrectly equated
declining denominational ties with declining religion. To test this assumption, in
addition to requesting information on denomination, their survey also asked for the
name and address of the respondent’s place of worship. In this way the researchers
could use the information to locate the place of worship within a denominational
structure, even if the respondent did not recognize this connection.
Using this approach, only 10.8% of the population is determined to be religiously
unaffiliated, versus the 14% of previous surveys, and the previously unaccounted

for 3% belong to Evangelical denominations. The denominations with the greatest
affiliation include Catholic (21.2%), Evangelical Protestant (33.6%), and Mainline
Protestant (22.1%). Furthermore, of the 10.8% that report being unaffiliated with organized religion, 62.9% report believing in God or some higher power [6] (pp. 7–8, 12).
Religion is not in decline in the US and is experiencing growth similar to that
found in other areas of the world, namely an increase in Evangelical Protestantism,
Charismatic Christianity and  “spirituality” [7].
Within the USA the growth of  Charismatic Christianity can be seen within both
Catholicism as well as within Protestantism. In its earliest phase the Charismatic
movement was referred to as “Pentecostalism” and within the US it originated
in the early twentieth century within a marginalized urban community in Los
Angeles, the Asuza Street Apostalic Faith Mission. “Charismatic” is the more general term used to describe the movement in the later twentieth century. Charismatic
Christianity is characterized by an emphasis on a direct personal experience of
the Spirit of God, often evidenced in worship services by “speaking in tongues”
and “healings.” In addition to the rise of Charismatic Christianity within the US,
another notable, and related trend, is the increase in “spirituality.” Recall that even
of the 10.8% of individuals in the  Baylor Survey who report being unaffiliated
with organized religion, 62.9% report believing in God or some “higher power.”
This finding is revealed even more dramatically in the results of a recent Gallup
Poll, The Spiritual State of the Union: The Role of Spiritual Commitment in the
United States [8]. This survey, consisting of 1004 interviews with US adults conducted in February and March 2006, reports that 40% of the respondents described
themselves as “spiritual but not religious” and this percentage has increased by
10% since a similar survey conducted in 1999. The majority of respondents (49%)
still define themselves as “religious”; however, another 7% describe themselves as
“both” and only 3% as “neither.” When asked more specifically about their beliefs,
82% reported believing in God whereas 13% chose instead belief in a “universal
Spirit.” Note then that of the 40% who chose to describe themselves as “spiritual
but not religious” 26% still identify with theism.
Spirituality is also a factor in the UK, where Steve Bruce has shown that over
a 40-year time span belief in a personal God may have fallen by 8%, but at the
same time belief in “some sort of spirit or vital force which controls life” has
risen by 3% [9]. Paula Heelas uses this work as well as data on religious belief
in Sweden and the United States to argue that the middle ground, between those
who regularly attend church and those who are declared atheists and  agnostics,
is increasing, and this increase is due at least in part to the growth of spirituality [10]. What exactly do we mean by “spirituality”? Heelas defines the term
by contrasting it with religion, which she describes as being centered on a transcendent God whose will is mediated through tradition. Spirituality, in contrast,

is not concerned with institutionalized authority, but on a direct experience of the
­divine immanent in life:

“Spirituality” has to do with the personal; that which is interior or immanent; that
which is one’s experienced relationship with the scared; and that wisdom or knowledge
which derives from such experiences. At heart, spirituality has come to mean “life”
[10] (p. 358).

It appears that those who define themselves solely as spiritual actually share a common ground with the Charismatic branches of Evangelical Christians, Mainline
Protestants, and Catholics, and it is this common ground that is growing within
the USA. Heelas refers to this common ground as the “HS” factor, which for nontraditionalists, or non-theist spiritualists, implies “the ‘higher self’ within” that is
pursued. For more traditional or theistic spiritualities, “HS” refers to the quest for
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; for both the focus is on empowering this life in
the here and now. Can astrobiology actually provide a bridge to engaging a religious US public that increasingly, both within and outside of theistic traditions,
describes itself as spiritual? Maybe, if we are willing to build more than one type
of bridge.
How would the goals of astrobiology be viewed by those subscribing to theistic
spirituality , specifically the increasing numbers of Charismatic Christians in the
United States? As this group places more emphasis on interpreting the Bible as an
authoritative historical document than liberal Christian communities, we can predict that the greatest tension might be between what astrobiology learns about the
origin and evolution of life and the Biblical creation story. The same would be true
for conservative Evangelical Protestants. However, it would be incorrect to assume
that either all Charismatic Christians or all Evangelical Protestants will insist on
a literal reading of Genesis; not all are fundamentalists and in fact Charismatic
Christianity in the United States is characterized by the importance it places on a
direct experience of the divine, over a strict adherence to doctrine. For more liberal
Charismatic Christians and Evangelical Protestants the challenging theological
questions will be the same as those for liberal mainline Christians: what was God’s
role in an  origin of life that arose naturally, or, put another way, how does God act
in nature?
Emphasizing the nature of science and the differences between science and religion (see below) is one effort the scientific community can make to help alleviate
this tension, but serious theological work remains to be done as well. Whereas
some of this work is beginning to take place in liberal mainline Christian circles,3

the very nature of Charismatic Christianity, with its focus on individual experience
at the expense of institutionalized doctrine, will be counterproductive in terms of
building a theological framework that incorporates what science has learned about
the world. Much work remains for the Evangelical Protestant community as well.
As for the other questions astrobiology poses, concerning the extent of life
and the future of life, I would argue that these are less threatening, assuming that
our greatest possibility for discovering life in the near future is  microbial life on
Mars, and that they can provide unique opportunities for outreach. The discovery
of a  second genesis of life on Mars most likely would ignite origin and evolution
issues; microbial life related to Earth life would undoubtedly be an exciting discovery, but not one that is particularly challenging to religious beliefs. Future of
life questions, in the broadest interpretation, might appear as an irrelevant question
for Charismatic Christians and Evangelical Protestants in general, as the Biblical
account of history promises a future salvation. On the other hand, interpreting this
question in terms of sustainability issues on Earth can resonate with both liberal
and more conservative Christians, as recently evidenced by the agreement initiated
by prominent members of the Evangelical community to work collaboratively with
the scientific community on global climate change [11].
I suggest above that we should not expect Charismatic Christianity to be encouraging of developing theologies that incorporate scientific findings, not because of
a negative attitude toward science, but because the focus of  spirituality is on individual experience, not the development of doctrine. However, I also suggest that
particular assumptions and possible discoveries of astrobiology will most likely be
met with resistance by members of this group, as well as Evangelical Protestants
in general, and even many liberal Christians, because of the challenges they raise
concerning God’s role in nature and creation. That said, I am still intrigued by the
identification of  “spirituality” with “life,” quoted above, and what this might imply
for a research and exploration program focused on life. Does astrobiology present a
unique opportunity for the scientific community to engage with religious communities, whose members are increasingly defining themselves as spiritual, through a
shared interest in “life”?
There is evidence that the answer for non-theist spiritualists, admittedly a smaller
percentage than the theist spiritualists (13% vs. 26%), is yes. Consider, for example,
the work of Ursula Goodenough [12]. Her main premise, eloquently expressed in
her work, The Sacred Depths of Nature, is that a modern understanding of nature
can give rise to religious emotions, which she defines as “shared cosmology and
shared morality.” Through the story that science tells about the cosmos, with an
emphasis on the origin and interconnectedness of life on this planet, a planetary
ethic may emerge that will provide a guideline for addressing global concerns,
including sustainability issues. For the non-theist spiritualist the story about life

that astrobiology is both telling, and striving to discover, might serve to encourage
an interior experience of the divine, that is, “The Sacred Depths of Nature.” Can
the same be true for a theist spiritualist, particularly if their worldview stems from
conservative Christianity? Perhaps the answer depends on how the astrobiology
community engages these individuals.
The scientific community at large, despite unfortunately the opinion of some
of its most vocal members, is taking great effort to remind the public that science
and religion do not need to be in conflict. One recent example is the new publication by the National Academy of Science, Science, Evolution, and Creationism
[13]. This publication emphasizes the “non-overlapping magesteria” or contrast
view of science and religion which was popularized within the scientific community especially by  Stephen J. Gould and his book Rock of Ages: Science and
Religion in the Fullness of Life [14]. Simply put, this model assumes that there
can be no conflict between science and religion since they respond to different
questions; science tells us how, religion tells us why. The  Clergy Letter Project is
another recent effort that promotes the contrast view of science and religion [15].
The letter was initiated on the part of the scientific community (in response to
the controversy over the teaching of evolution in public science classrooms) but
seeks the help of clergy to spread the message. To date over 11,000 clergy members have signed the letter, which includes the plea, “We ask that science remain
science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary
forms of truth.” This is a message the scientific community is comfortable with
and one that fits nicely within a broader program that encourages the scientific
community at large to pay careful attention to how they “frame” their public
statements [16].
Certainly, in regards to engaging a religious public around what science is learning about the world, this model is preferable to one more commonly assumed,
a conflict model, which depicts science and religion as two endeavors inherently
at odds with one another (a model which historians of science and religion have
shown to be oversimplified).4 When we speak as science educators we use the contrast model when we desperately try to help people understand what science is and
can do, and what it isn’t and can’t do. This is an important message and one that
scientists need to keep conveying. That said, I would argue that another approach
has its time and place as well and that the astrobiology community would do well
to embrace that approach – namely one that looks for dialogue and interaction.5 In
order to participate in that approach, we need to be able to listen, and to recognize

that different religious constituencies will require different engagement models – we
must be building multiple bridges.
Let me illustrate that point with a quote from the Washington Post Magazine in
January 2006. The cover from that edition read, “Darwin vs. God, what the war
between evolution and  Intelligent Design is really about.” I believe the author, who
interviewed students, teachers, and scientists for this story, expresses quite nicely
why we need more than a contrast approach in dealing with science and religion,
“If intelligent design advocates  have generally been blind to the overwhelming
evidence for evolution, scientists have generally been deaf to concerns about evolution’s implication” [17].

1.2.1  Who is it that feels we are not listening and
what can we do to reach them?
 The 2005 Pew Survey responses, when broken down according to the broad
Christian religious affiliation categories of “Evangelical,” “Mainline Protestant,”
and “Roman Catholic,” illustrate that all affiliations, even secular, have a percentage of individuals who believe that “life has existed in its present form since the
beginning of time.” This view is, however, predominant among those who classified themselves as Evangelicals (70% of Evangelicals). Mainline Protestants and
Catholics are more accepting of life evolving over time (60%) with nearly equal
amounts attributing the process to natural selection or guidance by a supreme
being  [2]. The contrast view of science and religion is particularly appealing to
Mainline Protestants as is demonstrated, for example, by the positive response
these congregations have given to another outreach effort associated with the
Clergy Letter Project, “Evolution Sunday.”
Evolution Sunday, held near Darwin’s birthday, encourages clergy to devote
one Sunday to emphasizing that science and religion complement one another [15].
Assigning denominations to the same broad religious affiliations used in the
Baylor Survey [6], we find that of the 558 congregations that participated in
Evolution Sunday in 2007 the majority (78%) represented Mainline Protestant
churches; the next largest category (18.1%) consisted predominantly of Unitarian
Universalist congregations (a liberal religion with Judeo-Christian roots).
Evangelical Protestant congregations accounted for less than 2% of the participating congregations.
The success story of the Clergy Letter Project, Evolution Sunday, and the contrast approach in general, is that mainline Christian denominations are being vocal
about supporting the teaching of evolution. This is good news. A remaining and
serious challenge is to engage evangelical communities on this issue and a contrast approach to science and religion is unlikely to accomplish this end. We need
to honestly ask ourselves, is our goal limited to keeping  creationism out of the

science classroom, perhaps by majority rule, or are we interested in working long
term towards a widespread acceptance of evolution? A widespread acceptance of
evolution in the United States will require that the scientific community go beyond
a simple contrast approach and be willing to encourage, and participate in, a program of in-depth and long-term engagement with theologians and religious community leaders.
We are correct in helping people understand that science can’t by itself answer
questions about meaning. But in doing only this, without a broader conversation,
are we also suggesting that what science learns about the world, what the world is,
has absolutely no relevance for our thoughts about what the world means? Are we
condoning a focus on life as an interior experience, disconnected from the larger
context? If astrobiology has done anything for the scientific community it has at
minimum encouraged us to expand our vision beyond that of our immediate discipline, to see the larger context and to struggle to find a way to participate in a multidisciplinary scientific dialogue. This is the very contribution that I suggest makes
astrobiology the ideal discipline for expanding the dialogue into an even broader
context with a specific invitation to theologians and religious leaders to participate.
We may even be able to build on the interest of theistic spiritualists in “life” so that
through astrobiology in particular we may engage their interest in what science has
learned about the world.
Securing a religious public’s support for space science research and exploration,
so that it merits a high enough priority to claim resources, though vital, is only the
beginning. It is in the sharing of what we learn from the exploration that the process comes full circle, and then, only when the discoveries are owned by both the
religious and the spiritual, both the liberal and conservative. Hopefully this volume
provides one example of the broadening of context that can occur for all involved
when members of the astrobiology community invite theologians, ethicists, histor­
ians and philosophers to learn about astrobiology, to reflect on its work from the
perspective of their own discipline, and to share their findings with the scientific
community and the public at large. Summarized below are the key points of the
contributors to this volume, organized according to astrobiology themes .
1.3  Origin of life
Where did we come from? Astrobiology includes the study of the origin and evolution of life on Earth and draws on the results of these studies to explore the possibility of life arising and thriving on other planetary bodies. The authors of the
first part of this volume, an origins researcher, a historian, a philosopher, and two
theologians, specifically address the origins question from the perspective of their
discipline. They provide an introduction to the science of life’s origin; describe

attitudes towards the  definition of life as a function of historical context; use the
study of life’s origin as an example to illustrate the nature of science; offer an early
Christian perspective on life’s origin which can reflect favorably on current scientific understanding; and argue for the unique perspective Theology can bring to
astrobiology’s pursuits around the questions of origin and future of life.
The focus of origins research is elucidating how the first living cell arose from
non-living matter, a formidable task. Both  Hazen and  Fry emphasize that although
the specific, historical pathway that gave rise to life on Earth may never be known,
the scientific community harbors great optimism for discovering the general chemical pathways that led to this outcome. Hazen suggests that the study of emergence,
“the natural process by which complexity arises” can provide a unifying theme for
origins research and that the emergent systems approach is particularly amenable
to experimentation.
Fry prefers an “arch and scaffolding model” as a unifying theme for origins
research. She argues that this model excels at providing an answer to the question
of apparent design, a question posed by the fact that both  metabolism and replication of genetic material are required for cell functioning. If these two distinct
systems are dependent on one another, how then can evolution account for their
appearance? Fry suggests that the various solutions offered to answer this dilemma
all have in common the analogy of a supporting scaffold used to build a stone arch;
the scaffold is present during construction but not obvious in the final product.
Both Hazen  and Fry note that  origin-of-life research is a relatively recent
endeavor propelled forward by the Miller–Urey experiments 50 years ago . Fry also
argues that this is the time during which the theory of evolution “came into maturity” opening the door to the assumption that life formed in the past through a natural process from inorganic matter. Origin-of-life research, she argues, should be
granted the same scientific status as  evolution research and not viewed as a weak
point in the scientific explanation of the history of life.
 Strick’s review of changes in the definition of life from a historical perspective
illustrates how the origin-of-life question was handled gingerly both by Darwin
and his supporters.  Darwin was well aware that the  theory of evolution would be
challenging for a religious public and in the first edition of Origins took great care
to leave the possibility of divine intervention open in regards to the appearance of
the first life form . Strick’s review of the reactions of Darwin’s supporters, both religious and non-religious to the definition of life and its first origins, and changing
perspectives on the definition of life by scientists up until the present, demonstrates
the important role cultural experience plays in the scientific endeavor.
Cultural experience also plays an important role in Theology.  McMullin’s
contribution to this volume traces the influence of the prevailing philosophies of
 Augustine’s time on his views on creation. Augustine, a prominent theologian

in the early Christian church whose work is foundational for Christian theology,
offers a view of creation that allows for a gradualist account of life’s origin and
diversity. McMullin argues that Augustine’s view of creation is also supportive of
a natural transition from non-life to life on early Earth. He finds in Augustine’s
work an alternative to the divine intervention that  Intelligent Design advocates
call for. Unfortunately, as  McMullin notes, Augustine’s views on creation were
not supported by Church authorities and also fell victim to the tendency for literal
interpretation of the Bible that flourished with the Protestant reformation.
The origin-of-life discussion in this volume concludes with the thoughts of a
contemporary theologian,  Deane-Drummond, whose contribution reviews the
theological themes associated with origin-of-life and ethical issues raised by both
origin and future of life research. She concludes by arguing that Theology has a
distinctive contribution to make when considering future discoveries and research.
Her work outlines why naturalistic explanations are not threatening to theists and
how theological ethics can particularly encourage a reflection on our responsibility
to future generations.
Perhaps the time is right for Augustine’s views on creation to be revisited and
for the views of theologians that embrace and welcome naturalistic explanations
of life’s origin and diversity to be heard both within and outside of the church. If
this were to occur, then origin-of-life research might be more broadly described as
a challenging but fruitful frontier, rather than a weak and controversial point in a
scientific narrative. And as we approach a clearer understanding of the origin of the
first cell, perhaps duplicating a possible scenario in the laboratory, scientists will, I
believe, benefit from the encouragement and insight of theologians equipped with
an understanding and acceptance of the scientific worldview, yet ready to offer the
insights of a different tradition.
1.4  Extent of life
Are we alone? Dialogue participants were asked to consider this question with a
focus on searching for and discovering extraterrestrial (ET) non-intelligent life,
specifically  microbial life, either on a planetary body within our  solar system or
one beyond our solar system. The scientific contributions to this part describe how
life on Earth can provide a model for searching for life elsewhere, and the status
of our search for habitable extrasolar planets. A historical perspective that traces
how the philosophical, ethical, and theological issues associated with ET life have
been raised and addressed through time is included, as is a contribution that categorizes the main philosophical issues associated with the search and discovery
of ET life. Unique to this part of the volume, there is also a specific discussion of
policy issues that need to be addressed in regards to searching for and discovering

ET life. The final contribution to this part explores if, and how, views of God will
change if ET life is discovered.
Where else in the  solar system might we look for life?  Rothschild reminds us
how the possibilities have been expanded by both our growing understanding of
life’s tenacity on Earth, gleaned from studies of life in extreme environments, and
by the exploration of our  solar system. The  search for life is guided, by necessity,
by what we know about terrestrial life. Terrestrial life is carbon and water based,
diverse, dominated by microbes and can survive in extreme environmental conditions. Extrapolating from the terrestrial life model Mars, for example, is judged one
likely candidate for harboring existing or extant ET life because of the evidence for
liquid water on its surface in the past, and likely underground in the present.  Pilcher
and  Lissauer’s contribution outlines another major development in the search for
ET life, the hundreds of planets now known to be orbiting stars other than our
own Sun, and the technical advances currently taking place that will expand the
ability of astronomers to detect Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of their
parent stars (distances at which liquid water at the surface of the planets is plausible)  . Pilcher and Lissauer suggest that in the next couple of decades we will know
whether planets like these are common or rare. We may even be able to search for
biosignatures, evidence of life, in their atmospheres.
The possibilities of exploration and research currently underway are certainly
exciting, and I imagine they will naturally result in a renewed interest in pondering
humanity’s place in the universe, but in this volume  Dick reminds us that throughout history the philosophical, ethical, and theological issues associated with ET
life have been considered. He notes that the possibility of other worlds, though not
necessarily raising challenges for theism in general, does pose interesting questions for specific Christian doctrines. He argues that one result of Darwin’s work
was that these discussions were broadened to include the idea of cosmic evolution,
and a universe characterized by its distinct orientation towards biology. He suggests the latter idea, dubbed the  “biological universe,” has attained the status of a
worldview.
In categorizing the philosophical issues raised by the search for ET life,  Lupisella
also notes the impact on worldviews the search may produce. Will the search confirm a “biological,” or in Lupisella’s terminology “deliberate,” universe or will
we conclude that life is a rare and random event? Under these different scenarios
how will humanity’s views on value and meaning fare? Other philosophical issues
he highlights include all of the questions raised by the fact that the exploration
occurs in the light of only one known data point – life on Earth. For example,
if we discover ET life in the solar system how will we discern whether or not it
represents an independent origin of life? Another category of philosophical issues
noted by Lupisella , and covered in greater detail in the final part of this volume, is

the ethical considerations due to ET life, specifically microbial life. Where is our
“prime directive”?
The “prime directive” or policy issues, are specifically noted in  Race’s
­contribution to this volume. Race outlines how the different types of potential
discoveries will in fact require different types of policies. For example, the discovery of intelligent life rather than microbial life, or the discovery of a planet that
could potentially be habitable by life as we know it, would most certainly call for
different types of policies to be put into practice. Unfortunately, she notes that the
 science and technology are far ahead of current policies, which are focused largely
on issues of  cross-contamination and protecting future scientific exploration.
The final contribution to this part of the volume turns again to the question of philosophical issues, with a specific focus on theology that is framed by
the question – “How will our views of God change if we discover ET life?” To
answer this question  Crysdale reviews the theological issues raised by an evolving universe, noting that the challenges posed by astrobiology are related to issues
surrounding evolution. Ideas of divine  determinism and intervention, as well as
a view of humanity as the apex of meaning, have to be reconsidered. She offers
an example of a revised classical theism that accepts both continuity and novelty in God . Crysdale concludes her contribution with a reminder that humanity lives within an  ethic of risk, not control, and this reality should inform our
exploration.
The dominant motif of this discussion is that the questions, particularly the
philosophical and theological ones, raised by the search for and potential discovery
of ET microbial life are not necessarily new, but there is a renewed urgency to consider the possible answers. Scientific and technological advancements are such that
we are cycling closer than we have ever been before to discovering whether or not
ET life exists. At minimum the question has shifted from one of speculation to one
that has hope of being tested empirically. The proximity of an answer also heightens the need for sustaining an ethical and policy discussion that extends beyond a
consideration of protecting future scientific discoveries. The final part of this volume provides insight into the types of topics such a discussion will encompass.
1.5  Future of life
Where are we going? Beyond understanding the history of life and the expanse of
life, astrobiology is also concerned with the next chapter in life’s story, both here
on Earth and possibly other planetary bodies. Questions that could fall under the
future of life topic are numerous, but the works collected in this volume specifically address one: is planetary  ecosynthesis on Mars, commonly referred to as
 terraforming, technologically feasible, and if so what are the ethical issues raised

by this possibility? This part of the volume includes a description of the suitability
of Mars for supporting either  transported terrestrial life or indigenous Martian
life, and the technological steps that would be necessary to create a sustained biosphere on Mars. This introduction is followed by the presentation of three ethical
frameworks for considering whether or not what might be done should be done.
One framework explicitly draws on perspectives from the Christian tradition to
consider these options and the other two are secular in nature. This final part of the
volume also includes a contribution that considers how the role that stories play in
Asian religions can offer new insight on all three astrobiology topics: the origin,
extent, and future of life.
 McKay begins this part of the volume by making a compelling argument that,
given current technology and the natural resources available on the planet, Mars
could be warmed, in about 100 years, to support a biosphere. He draws reference
to a fact that we have recently become all too painfully familiar with – humans
know how to increase the temperature of a planet and have unintentionally done
just that to our own. The biosphere McKay is referring to, however, is not one that
could support human life, but one that is similar to the biosphere that existed on
Earth prior to the rise of O2. Planetary  ecosynthesis of this nature on Mars is not
limited to the realm of science fiction. McKay then goes on to argue that utilitarian and intrinsic worth ethical arguments would both support a decision to move
forward with  ecosynthesis on Mars. Intrinsic worth arguments that include valuing
the diversity of life support an argument that life should be encouraged to thrive on
Mars, but indigenous life gets first priority. As McKay points out, this conclusion
will place very specific demands on guidelines for conducting the current exploration of Mars.
 Smith takes exception to  McKay’s use of intrinsic value arguments to encourage planetary  ecosynthesis on Mars. He recognizes that it is common practice in
environmental ethics to extend intrinsic value beyond humans, but questions what
criteria are used to distinguish between an entity that possesses intrinsic value and
one that does not. He argues that defining these criteria is essential and offers one
solution, a “ratio-centric” approach. In this system the ability to reason is the defining criterion by which intrinsic value is assigned. For the sake of clarity, note that
this assignment can be based on membership of a larger group and is not dependent
on individual merit, i.e. mentally impaired individuals are not excluded as they are
members of humanity. Smith suggests that having such a specific criterion in place
will result in a “clear mechanism” for decision making . This does not mean that
Smith is opposed on ethical grounds to encouraging life, either terrestrial or indigenous, to thrive on Mars, but that he is opposed to using a process to reach a decision on this matter that depends on intrinsic value being assigned to non-rational
entities in the absence of a defining criterion.

Constance M. Bertka

 Randolph, drawing on the Christian tradition, offers an alternative to using the
ability to reason as the criterion for assigning intrinsic value. He begins his chapter
by asking why a specifically Christian perspective on the issue is pertinent at all,
and answers in part from a pragmatic standpoint that I find persuasive. Christians
represent a significant proportion of the US population and the astrobiology community would do well to understand their perspectives. Randolph is not suggesting,
however, that this is the only perspective that deserves consideration and in fact
argues for the value of inviting a diverse collection of religious views to the discussion. The main point of his essay though is to present a specifically  Christian ethical framework. He accomplishes this by emphasizing two themes in scripture that
he suggests should be used as guides for contemporary thought. The first is that
God has a preferential option for life and the second is that although all of life has
intrinsic value, humanity alone has been entrusted with a responsibility to serve all
of nature. Using these themes as the foundation, his contribution then explores the
protections due to Earth life, and ET life (with a focus on microbial life), and the
ethical questions raised by the possibility of planetary  ecosynthesis on Mars.
These three contributions together make the point more forcibly than any single one alone could, how important it will be to ensure that an inclusive dialogue
precedes our actions as a space-faring culture. The ethical frameworks presented
by  McKay,  Smith, and Randolph  could all be used to argue for planetary  ecosynthesis on Mars. The possibility of the same outcome is intriguing, but in my
opinion less important than the reality that each framework has the potential to
draw our attention to the potential consequences of our actions, or inactions, that
we might have previously ignored if not for the insights of traditions beyond our
own. Technological advances will continue to guarantee that we face new choices.
I believe we stand better equipped to respond to these choices if we are also challenged to move beyond the comfort of our own frameworks. The final contribution
to this volume, a chapter that describes Asian religious perspectives on storytelling,
provides a concrete example of how common Western motifs for the relationship
between science and religion are called into question by Asian perspectives.
 Cho argues that science and religion are often described as telling different stories about the world and that a Western perspective calls for the proper relationship
between these two stories to be defined. Beyond adopting a view of inherent conflict between the two stories, she argues that the most common Western responses
are to describe them as either complementary stories, where each is needed to
complete the whole, or to seek to integrate the two stories into one. From an Asian
perspective the reality of many stories, without the constraints of either wholeness
or integration, is welcomed as it provides an opportunity to draw from a wealth of
stories to choose the most useful for a given context. She encourages us to think
about how the relationship between science and religion, and the consequences

that result from assumptions about that relationship, might be altered if an Asian
perspective was adopted.
1.6  Concluding thoughts
Cho’s  contribution to this volume is a vital reminder that the work presented here
is only a beginning, focused from a pragmatic perspective on Christian theological
responses, but by no means meant to be a conclusive work. The papers collected
here cannot claim to be conclusive as to Christian theological views, let alone other
philosophical, or ethical views, and it was never the intent of this work to approach
that goal. Instead, I hope the contributions collected here will encourage a continued
interest in exploring the work of astrobiology from a multidisciplinary perspective.
I believe that astrobiology as a discipline is particularly burdened, perhaps blessed,
with the responsibility to speak to society at large. After all, humanity itself may
be inherently defined by the ability we collectively possess to ask “Where did we
come from?,” “Are we alone?,” and “Where are we going?” I have found that the
answers proposed in community, especially a diverse one, are far more intriguing
than those I derive on my own. I hope this volume provides a similar experience for
all who are generous enough to consider its content.

Emergence and the  experimental pursuit
of the origin of life
Robert M. Hazen

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

The origin of life involved many, many emergences.
Harold Morowitz [1]

The experimental investigation of life’s origin commenced in earnest more than
a half-century ago with the pioneering work of  Miller [2], who synthesized many
of life’s molecular building blocks under plausible prebiotic conditions. Despite
an initial euphoric sense that the origin mystery would soon be solved, scientists
quickly realized that the transition from a geochemical to a biochemical world
would not easily be deduced by the scientific method.
The great challenge of origins research lies in replicating in a laboratory setting
the extraordinary increase in complexity that is required to evolve from isolated
molecules to a living cell. The principal objective of this review is to describe some
of the efforts by origin-of-life researchers to induce such increases in complexity.
A unifying theme of these studies, and hence a useful organizing framework for
this review, is the principle of emergence – the natural process by which complexity
arises.
2.1  Emergence as a unifying concept
in origins research
The origin of life may be modeled as a sequence of so-called “emergent” events,
each of which added new structure and chemical complexity to the prebiotic
Earth. Observations of numerous everyday phenomena reveal that new patterns
commonly emerge when energy flows through a collection of many interacting
particles [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Robert M. Hazen

In the words of  John Holland, an influential leader in the study of  emergent
s­ ystems, “It is unlikely that a topic as complicated as emergence will submit
meekly  to a concise definition, and I have no such definition” [6]. Nevertheless,
emergent systems display three distinctive characteristics: (1) they arise from the
interactions of many particles or “agents”; (2) energy flows through those systems
of particles; and (3) they display new patterns or behaviors that are not manifest
by the individual agents. Sand grains, for example, interact under the influence of
wind or waves to form dune and ripple structures [8, 9]. Similarly, ants interact to
form colonies,  neurons interact to produce consciousness, and people interact to
form societies [10, 11] .
The history of the universe may be viewed as a progression of emergent events,
from hydrogen to stars, from stars to the periodic table of chemical elements, from
chemical elements to planets and life, from life to consciousness [1, 7, 12]. The
inexorable stepwise transition from simplicity to emergent complexity is an intrinsic characteristic of the cosmos. In such a pregnant universe, one need not resort to
divine intervention nor to Intelligent Design for life’s origin. Thus, in spite of the
lack of a precise definition, the recognition and description of these varied emergent systems provides an important foundation for origins of life research, for life
is the quintessential emergent phenomenon. From vast collections of interacting
lifeless molecules emerged the first living cell. Understanding the underlying principles governing such emergent systems thus provides insights to our experimental
and theoretical efforts to understand life’s origins.
Framing the origin-of-life problem in terms of emergence is more than simply
providing a new label to parts of the origin story we don’t understand. Emergent
systems share key characteristics that can inform origin models. For example, all
emergent systems, including collections of sand or cells or stars, require a minimum
number of interacting agents before new patterns arise [7, 10]. These systems also
require a source of energy within specific limits – too little energy and no patterning occurs, but too much energy and patterns are destroyed [7, 12]. Experimental
observations of emergent systems also reveal that cycling of energy commonly
enhances emergent complexity [7, 13, 14]. An understanding of these and other
general characteristics of emergent systems thus informs experimental design and
the theoretical analysis of life’s origins.
One key to understanding life’s origin is to recognize the critical role of disequilibrium. Many familiar natural systems lie close to chemical and physical equilibrium
and thus do not display emergent behavior. For example, water gradually cooled
to below the freezing point equilibrates to become a clear chunk of ice, whereas
water gradually heated above the boiling point similarly equilibrates by converting to steam. Dramatically different behavior occurs far from equilibrium. Water
subjected to the strong temperature gradient of a boiling pot displays complex

turbulent convection [3, 4]. Water flowing downhill in the gravitational gradient
of a river valley interacts with sediments to produce the emergent landforms of
braided streams, meandering rivers, sandbars and deltas. Emergent systems seem
to share a common origin; they arise away from equilibrium when energy flows
through a collection of many interacting agents. Such systems tend spontaneously
to become more ordered and display new, often surprising behaviors. The whole is
more than the simple sum of the parts.
The overarching problem with studying life’s origins is that even the simplest
known life form is vastly more complex than any non-living components that might
have contributed to it. How does such astonishing, intricate complexity arise from
lifeless raw materials? What now appears to us as a yawning divide between nonlife and life reflects the fact that the chemical evolution of life must have occurred
as a stepwise sequence of successively more complex stages of emergence [7].
When modern cells emerged, they quickly consumed virtually all traces of these
earlier stages of chemical evolution.
The challenge, therefore, is to establish a progressive hierarchy of emergent
steps that leads from a prebiotic ocean enriched in organic molecules, to functional
clusters of molecules perhaps self-assembled or arrayed on a mineral surface, to
self-replicating molecular systems that copied themselves from resources in their
immediate environment, to encapsulation and eventually cellular life. The nature
and sequence of these steps may have varied in different environments and we
may never deduce the exact sequence that occurred on the early Earth. Yet many
researchers suspect that the inexorable direction of the chemical path is similar on
any habitable planet or moon [1, 7, 15].
Such a stepwise scenario informs attempts to  define life, because the exact point
at which such a system of gradually increasing complexity becomes “alive” is
intrinsically arbitrary. The evolutionary path to cellular life must have featured a
rich variety of intermediate, complex, self-replicating emergent chemical systems.
Each of those steps represents a distinctive, fundamentally important stage in life’s
molecular synthesis and organization. Each step requires independent experimental study, and perhaps a distinctive name in a taxonomy richer than “living” versus
“non-living” [7, 16].
Ultimately, the key to defining the progressive stages between non-life and life
lies in experimental studies of relevant chemical systems under plausible geochemical environments. The concept of emergence simplifies this experimental endeavor
by reducing an immensely complex historical process to a more comprehensible
succession of measurable steps. Each emergent step provides a tempting focus for
laboratory experimentation and theoretical modeling .
This view of life’s origin, as a stepwise transition from geochemistry to biochemistry, is of special relevance to the search for life elsewhere in the universe.

Before an effective search can be undertaken, it is necessary to know what to look
for. It is plausible, for example, that Mars, Europa, and other bodies ­progressed
only part way along the chemical path to cellular life. If each emergent step in
life’s origin produces distinctive and measurable isotopic, molecular, and structural signatures in its environment, and if such markers can be identified, then
these chemical features represent important observational targets for planned
space missions. It is possible, for example, that characteristic isotopic, molecular, and structural “fossils” survive only if they have not been eaten by more
advanced cells. We may find that those distinctive molecular structures can serve
as extraterrestrial “abiomarkers” – clear evidence that molecular organization
and evolution never progressed beyond a certain pre-cellular stage. As scientists
search for life elsewhere in the universe, they may be able to characterize extraterrestrial environments according to their degree of emergence along this multi-step
path [7, 17].

2.2   The emergence of biomolecules
The first vital step in life’s emergence on Earth must have been the synthesis and
accumulation of abundant  carbon-based biomolecules. In the beginning, life’s raw
materials consisted of water, rock, and simple volcanic gases – predominantly
carbon dioxide and nitrogen, but with local concentrations of hydrogen, methane,
ammonia, and other species. Decades of experiments have revealed that diverse
suites of organic molecules can emerge from geochemical environments.
The experimental pursuit of geochemical organic synthesis, arguably the best
understood aspect of life’s origin, began a half-century ago with the pioneering
studies of University of Chicago graduate student  Stanley Miller and his distinguished mentor  Harold Urey [1, 18, 19]. Together they established the potential role
of organic synthesis that occurred in Earth’s primitive atmosphere and ocean as
they were subjected to bolts of lightning and the Sun’s intense radiation.
This experimental investigation of life’s origin is a surprisingly recent pursuit.
Two centuries ago most scientists accepted the intuitively reasonable idea that life
is generated spontaneously all around us, all the time. The question of life’s ancient
origins was not asked, at least not in the modern experimental sense [20, 21, 22].
By the early twentieth century many scientists would have agreed that life’s
origins, wherever and however it occurs, depends on three key resources. First, all
known life forms require liquid water. All living cells, even those that survive in
the driest desert ecosystem, are formed largely of water. Surely the first cells arose
in a watery environment.
Life also needs a ready source of energy. The radiant energy of the Sun provides
the most obvious supply for life today, but bolts of lightning, impacts of asteroids,

Earth’s inner heat and the chemical energy of minerals have also been invoked as
life-triggering energy sources.
And, thirdly, life depends on a variety of chemical elements. All living organisms consume atoms of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with a bit of sulfur
and phosphorus and other elements as well. These elements combine in graceful
geometries to form essential biomolecules.
In spite of the intrinsic importance of the topic, it was not until the 1920s that
such scientific speculation took a more formal guise. Most notable among the modern school of origin theorists was the Russian chemist  Alexander Oparin [23]. In
1924, while still in his twenties and under the scrutiny of the atheist, Marxist Soviet
hierarchy, Oparin elaborated on the idea that life arose from a body of water that
gradually became enriched in organic molecules – the so-called “Oparin Ocean”
or the “primordial soup.” Somehow, he posited, these molecules clustered together
and became self-organized into a chemical system that could duplicate itself. In
many other cultures, where religious doctrine colored thinking on origins, these
revolutionary ideas would have been seen as heretical but Oparin’s ideas resonated
with the materialist worldview of the Leninist leadership.
Many of Oparin’s postulates were echoed in 1929 by the independent ideas of
British biochemist and geneticist J. B. S.  Haldane, whose brief, perceptive article
focused on the production of large  carbon-based molecules under the influence
of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation [24]. Given such a productive chemical environment, Haldane envisioned the first living objects as self-replicating, specialized
molecules .
2.2.1   The Miller–Urey experiment
Oparin and Haldane  offered original and intriguing ideas that were subject to
experimental testing, but Oparin  and his contemporaries didn’t try to replicate
experimentally the prebiotic formation of  biomolecules. Not until the years after
World War II were the landmark experiments of Miller and Urey devised [2, 19,
25]. They mimicked Earth’s early surface by sealing water and simple gases into
a tabletop glass apparatus and subjecting the contents to electric sparks. When
the experiment began the water was pure and clear, but within days the solution
turned yellowish and a black residue had begun to accumulate near the electrodes.
Reactions of water and volcanic gases had produced organic molecules, most notably a suite of amino acids (the building blocks of  proteins), in abundance. The
Miller–Urey experiment transformed the science of life’s chemical origins. For the
first time an experimental protocol duplicated a plausible life-forming process.
Given such an exciting finding, other groups jumped at the chance to duplicate
the amino acid feat. More than a dozen amino acids were synthesized from scratch,

along with other key  biomolecules: membrane-forming lipids, energy-rich sugars
and other carbohydrates, and metabolic acids. Enthusiasm grew as other scientists
discovered promising new chemical pathways. In 1960 chemist John Oró demonstrated that a hot, concentrated hydrogen cyanide solution produces adenine, a
crucial biomolecule that plays a role in both genetic material and in  metabolism
[26, 27]. Other chemists conducted similar experiments starting with relatively
concentrated solutions of formaldehyde, a molecule thought to be common in some
prebiotic environments [28]. Their simple experiments produced a rich variety of
sugar molecules, including the critical compound ribose. Gradually, researchers
filled in gaps in the prebiotic inventory of life’s molecules.
As exciting and important as these results may have been, seemingly intractable
problems remain. Within a decade of Miller’s triumph serious doubts began to
arise about the true composition of Earth’s earliest atmosphere. Miller exploited a
highly reactive, chemically reducing atmosphere of methane, ammonia and hydrogen – an atmosphere distinctly lacking in oxygen. But by the 1960s, new geochemical calculations and data from ancient rocks pointed to a much less reducing early
atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and carbon dioxide – unreactive gases
that do almost nothing of interest in a Miller apparatus [29].
For decades Miller and his supporters have countered with a pointed argument:
the molecules of life match those of the original Miller experiment with great fidelity. Miller’s advisor, Harold Urey, is said to have often quipped, “If God did not do
it this way, then he missed a good bet” [25] (p. 41). Most geochemists discount the
possibility of more than a trace of atmospheric methane or ammonia at the time of
life’s emergence (except perhaps in local volcanic environments) [30, 31], though
Tian et al. recently proposed that hydrogen may have comprised as much as 30%
of the Hadean atmosphere [32, 33].
Added to this atmospheric concern is the fact that the molecular building blocks
of life created by Miller represent only the first step on the long road to life. Living
cells require that such small molecules be carefully selected and then linked together
into vastly more complex structures – lipid cell membranes, protein enzymes, and
other so-called “macromolecules.” Even under the most optimistic estimates, the
prebiotic ocean was an extremely dilute solution of countless thousands of different kinds of organic molecules, most of which play no known role in life. By what
processes were just the right molecules selected and organized?
The Miller–Urey scenario suffers from another nagging problem. Macromolecules
tend to fragment rather than form when subjected to lightning and the Sun’s ultraviolet light [29]. These so-called “ionizing” forms of energy are useful for making
highly reactive molecular fragments that combine into modest-sized molecules like
amino acids. Combining many amino acids into an orderly chain-like enzyme,
however, is best accomplished in a less destructive energy domain. Emergent

complexity relies on a flow of energy, to be sure, but not too much energy. Could
life have emerged in the harsh glare of daylight, or was there perhaps a different,
more benign origin environment ?

2.2.2  Deep origins
All living cells require a continuous source of energy. Until recently, scientists
claimed that the metabolic pathways of virtually all life forms rely directly or
indirectly on photosynthesis. This view of life changed in February 1977, with the
discovery of an unexpected deep-ocean ecosystem [34]. These thriving communities, cut off from the Sun, subsist on geothermal energy supplied by Earth’s inner
heat. Microbes serve as primary energy producers in these deep zones; they play
the same ecological role as plants at Earth’s sunlit surface. These one-celled vent
organisms exploit the fact that the cold oxygen-infused ocean water, the hot volcanic water, and the sulfur-rich mineral surfaces over which these mixing fluids
flow are not in chemical equilibrium. The unexpected discovery of this exotic ecosystem quickly led to speculation that a hydrothermal vent might have been the site
of life’s origin [35].
New support for the idea gradually consolidated, as hydrothermal ecosystems
were found to be abundant along ocean ridges of both the Atlantic and Pacific.
Researchers realized that at a time when Earth’s surface was blasted by a continuous meteorite bombardment, deep ocean ecosystems would have provided a much
more benign location than the surface for life’s origin and evolution [36, 37, 38].
New discoveries of abundant primitive microbial life in the deep continental crust
further underscored the viability of deep, hot environments [39, 40, 41]. By the
early 1990s, the deep-origin hypothesis had become widely accepted as a viable, if
unsubstantiated, alternative to the Miller surface scenario.
Following the revolutionary hydrothermal origins proposal, numerous scientists
began the search for life in deep, warm, wet environments. Everywhere they look, it
seems – in deeply buried sediments, in oil wells, even in porous volcanic rocks more
than a mile down – microbes abound. Microbes survive under miles of Antarctic
ice and deep in dry desert sand [42, 43]. These organisms seem to thrive on mineral
surfaces, where water-rock interactions provide the chemical energy for life.
Another incentive exists for looking closely at the possibility of deep origins.
If life is constrained to form in a sun-drenched pond or ocean surface then Earth,
and perhaps ancient Mars or Venus, are the only possible places where life could
have begun in our solar system. If, however, cells can emerge from deeply buried
wet zones, then life may be much more widespread than previously imagined. The
possibility of deep origins raises the stakes in our exploration of other planets and
moons.

Robert M. Hazen

The hydrothermal origins hypothesis received increased attention with the
p­ ublication of a seminal paper in 1988 – “Before enzymes and templates: theory of surface metabolism” by German chemist  Günter Wächtershäuser [44].
Wächtershäuser proposed a theory of organic evolution in which minerals, mostly
iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deep-sea volcanic vents, provide catalytic
surfaces for the synthesis and assembly of life. Wächtershäuser’s model incorporates several assumptions about the nature of the first living entity [44, 45, 46, 47,
48]. First, he rejects the “primordial soup” concept, arguing instead that the prebiotic emergence of biomolecules by Miller–Urey processes was irrelevant because
the primordial soup was much too dilute and contained too many useless molecular
species. Second, the first life form made its own molecules: most other workers
assume that the first living entity scavenged amino acids, lipids, and other useful
molecules from its surroundings – a strategy called “heterotrophy” (from the Greek
for “other nourishment”). Wächtershäuser denies that possibility, since the soup
was so dilute and unreliable. He counters that the first life must have been “autotrophic” (“self nourishment”) – manufacturing its own molecular building blocks
from scratch.
A third assumption is that the first life form relied on the chemical energy of
minerals, not the Sun. Sunlight and lightning are too violent and they are uncharacteristic of the energy sources that most cells use today. Photosynthesis, furthermore, is an immensely complex chemical cascade requiring numerous  proteins
and other specialized molecules. Surface reactions on minerals, by contrast, are
simple and similar to many cellular processes. Wächtershäuser also assumes that
metabolism – a simple cycle of chemical reactions that duplicates itself – comes
first. Many other researchers claim that life began with a self-replicating genetic
molecule like RNA, but even the simplest genetic molecule is vastly more complex
than anything in the soup.
These original ideas are amplified by one additional assumption common to all origin theories – that of biological continuity. Today’s biochemistry, no matter how intricate and dependent on specialized enzymes, has evolved in an unbroken path from
primordial geochemistry. Thus, for example, Wächtershäuser’s  scheme builds on the
observation that many of the molecules that enable living cells to process energy
have, at their very core, a mineral-like cluster of metal and sulfur atoms [49]. Could
this feature be a kind of biomolecular fossil, a remnant of primordial chemistry?
The central chemical postulate of Wächtershäuser’s theory is that iron and nickel
minerals served as templates, catalysts, and energy sources for biosynthesis, all in
one. In Wächtershäuser’s view, simple molecules like carbon monoxide and hydrogen react on mineral surfaces to produce larger molecules. These molecules tend to
have negative charges, and so stick to the positively charged mineral surfaces, where
more reactions build larger and larger molecules. This collection of surface-bound

molecules begins to feed off each other, eventually forming a chemical cycle that
copies itself.
Recent experiments bolster Wächtershäuser’s hypothesis. The most fundamental biological reaction is the incorporation of carbon atoms (starting with the gas
carbon dioxide) into organic molecules. Many common minerals, including most
minerals of iron, nickel, or copper, promote carbon addition [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,
56]. One conclusion seems certain. Mineral-rich hydrothermal systems contributed
to the early Earth’s varied inventory of bio-building blocks.
It now appears that anywhere energy and simple carbon-rich molecules are found
together, a suite of interesting organic molecules is sure to emerge [29]. In spite of the
polarizing advocacy of one favored environment or another [25, 57, 58], experiments
point to the likelihood that there was no single dominant source. By four billion
years ago Earth’s oceans must have become a complex, albeit dilute, soup of life’s
building blocks. Though not alive, this chemical system was poised to undergo a
sequence of increasingly complex stages of molecular organization and evolution.

2.3  The emergence of macromolecules
Prebiotic processes produced a bewildering diversity of molecules. Some of those
organic molecules were poised to serve as the essential starting materials of life,
but most of that molecular jumble played no role whatsoever in the dawn of life.
The emergence of concentrated suites of just the right mix remains a central puzzle
in origin-of-life research.
Life’s simplest molecular building blocks – amino acids, sugars, lipids, and
more – emerged inexorably through facile, inevitable chemical reactions in numerous prebiotic environments. A half-century of synthesis research has elaborated
on Miller’s breakthrough experiments. Potential biomolecules from many sources
must have littered the ancient Earth.
What happened next? Individual  biomolecules are not remotely lifelike. Life
requires the assembly of just the right combination of small molecules into much
larger collections  – “macromolecules” with specific functions. Making macromolecules is complicated by the fact that for every potentially useful small molecule in
the prebiotic soup, dozens of other molecular species had no obvious role in biology.
Life is remarkably selective in its building blocks; the vast majority of  carbon-based
molecules synthesized in prebiotic processes have no biological use whatsoever.
2.3.1  Life’s idiosyncrasies
Consider sugar molecules, for example [59]. All living cells rely on two kinds of
5-carbon sugar molecules, ribose and deoxyribose (the “R” and “D” in RNA and

DNA, respectively). Several plausible prebiotic synthesis pathways yield a small
amount of these essential sugars, but for every ribose molecule produced many
other 5-carbon sugar species also appear – xylose, arabinose, and lyxose, for
example. Adding to this chemical complexity is a bewildering array of 3-, 4-, 6-,
and 7-carbon sugars, in chain, branch, and ring structures. What’s more, many sugar
molecules, including ribose and deoxyribose, come in mirror-related pairs. These
left- and right-handed varieties possess the same chemical formula and many of
the same physical properties, but they differ in shape like left and right hands. All
known prebiotic synthesis pathways yield equal amounts of left- and right-handed
sugars, but cells employ only the right-handed sugar varieties. Consequently, many
origins researchers have shifted their focus to the processes by which just the right
molecules might have been selected, concentrated, and organized into the essential
structures of life.
The oceans are of little help because they are so vast – a volume greater than
320 million cubic miles. No matter how much organic matter was made, the oceans
formed a hopelessly dilute soup. In such a random, weak solution, it would have
been difficult for just the right combination of molecules to bump into one another
and make anything useful in the chemical path to life. By what process were the
right molecules selected?

2.3.2  Molecular selection
Lipid molecules, the building blocks of cell membranes, accomplish the selection
trick in a striking way. One end of these long, slender molecules is hydrophilic
(water loving), whereas the rest of the molecule is hydrophobic (water hating).
Consequently, when placed in water, life’s lipids spontaneously self-organize into
tiny cell-like spheres. This selection process is rapid and spontaneous [60, 61, 62].
Most molecules don’t self-organize. Consequently, many scientists have focused
on surfaces as an alternative solution. Chemical complexity can arise at surfaces,
where different molecules can congregate and interact. The surface of the ocean
where air meets water is one promising interface, where a primordial oil slick
might have concentrated organic molecules [63]. Evaporating tidal pools where
rock and water meet and cycles of evaporation concentrate stranded chemicals provide another appealing scenario for origin-of-life chemistry [64]. Deep within the
crust and in hydrothermal volcanic zones mineral surfaces may have embraced a
similar role, selecting, concentrating, and organizing molecules on their periodic
crystalline surfaces [38].
Solid rocks provide especially attractive surfaces for concentration and assembly of molecules. Experiments reveal that amino acids concentrate and polymerize
on clay particles to form small, protein-like molecules, while layered minerals also

have the ability to adsorb and assemble the building blocks of RNA or soak up
small organic molecules in the rather large spaces between layers [65, 66, 67, 68,
69, 70]. Once confined and concentrated, these small molecules tend to undergo
reactions to form larger molecular species that aren’t otherwise likely to emerge
from the soup.
In the most extreme version of this approach, Scottish researcher Graham
Cairns-Smith has speculated that fine-grained crystals of clay, themselves, might
have been the first life on Earth [71, 72, 73, 74]. The crux of the argument rests
on a simple analogy. Cairns-Smith likens the origin of life to the construction of
a stone archway, with its carefully fitted blocks and crucial central keystone that
locks the whole structure in place. But the arch cannot be built by just piling one
stone atop another. He proposes that a simple support structure like a scaffolding
facilitates the construction and then is removed. “I think this must have been the
way our amazingly ‘arched’ biochemistry was built in the first place. The parts that
now lean together surely used to lean on something else – something low tech” [73]
(p. 92). That something, he argues, was a clay mineral.

2.3.3  Right and left
One of the most intriguing and confounding examples of prebiotic molecular selection was the incorporation of handedness. Many of the most important  biomolecules, amino acids and sugars included, come in “chiral,” or mirror image, pairs.
These left- and right-handed molecules have virtually the same energies and physical properties, and all known prebiotic synthesis pathways produce chiral molecules in essentially 50:50 mixtures. Thus, no obvious inherent reason exists why
left or right should be preferred, yet living cells display the most exquisite selectivity, choosing right-handed sugars over left, and left-handed amino acids over right
[7, 75, 76, 77].
Some analyses of chiral amino acids in carbonaceous meteorites point to the
possibility that Earth was seeded by amino acids that already possessed a lefthanded bias [78, 79, 80]. According to one scenario, left-handed molecules could
have been concentrated if circularly polarized synchrotron light from a rapidly
rotating neutron star selectively photolyzed right-handed amino acids in the solar
nebula [81, 82, 83]. However, it is also difficult to eliminate entirely the possibility
of a left-handed overprint imposed in the laboratory during the difficult extraction
and analysis of meteorite organics.
Alternatively, many origin-of-life researchers argue that the chirality of life
occurred as a chance event – the result of an asymmetric local physical environment on Earth. Such local chiral environments abounded on the prebiotic Earth, both
as chiral molecules, themselves, and in the form of asymmetric mineral surfaces

[84, 85]. Experiments show that left- and right-handed mineral surfaces provide
one possible solution for separating a 50:50 mixture of L and D molecules [77, 86].
Minerals often display chiral crystal faces, which might have provided templates
for the assembly of life’s molecules.
In spite of these insights, many aspects of prebiotic molecular selection and
organization remain uncertain and thus represent topics of intense ongoing research.
Even so, the emergence of macromolecular structures is but one increment in the
stepwise progression from geochemistry to biochemistry. Life requires that macromolecules be incorporated into a self-replicating system.
2.4  The emergence of  self-replicating systems

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Four billion years ago the seeds of life had been firmly planted. The Archean Earth
boasted substantial repositories of serviceable organic molecules. These molecules
must have become locally concentrated, where they assembled into vesicles and
polymers of biological interest. Yet accumulations of organic molecules, no matter
how highly selected and intricately organized, are not alive unless they also possess the ability to reproduce. Devising a laboratory experiment to study chemical
self-replication has proven to be vastly more difficult than the prebiotic synthesis
of biomolecules or the selective concentration and organization of those molecules
into membranes and polymers. In a reproducing chemical system, one small group
of molecules must multiply again and again at the expense of other molecules,
which serve as food.
2.4.1   Metabolism versus genetic mechanisms
A fundamental debate on the origin of life relates to the timing of two essential
biological processes, metabolism versus replication of genetic material [15, 25, 87,
88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. Metabolism is the ability to manufacture biomolecular structures from a source of energy (such as sunlight) and matter scavenged from the
surroundings (usually in the form of small molecules). An organism can’t survive
and grow without an adequate supply of energy and matter. Genetic mechanisms,
by contrast, involve the transfer of biological information from one generation to
the next – a blueprint for life via the mechanisms of  DNA and RNA. An organism
can’t reproduce without a reliable means to pass on this genetic information.
The problem for understanding origins is that metabolism and genetic mechanisms constitute two separate, chemically distinct systems in cells. Nevertheless,
metabolism and genetic mechanisms are inextricably linked in modern life.  DNA
holds genetic instructions to make hundreds of molecules essential to metabolism,
while metabolism provides both the energy and the basic building blocks to make

 DNA and other genetic materials. Like the dilemma of the chicken and the egg,
it’s difficult to imagine back to a time when metabolism and genetic mechanisms
were not intertwined. Consequently, origin-of-life researchers engage in an intense
ongoing debate about whether these two aspects of life arose simultaneously or
independently and, if the latter, which one came first.
Most experts seem to agree that the simultaneous emergence of metabolism
and genetic mechanisms is unlikely. The chemical processes are just too different, and they rely on completely different sets of molecules. It’s much easier to
imagine life arising one small step at a time, but what is the sequence of emergent steps?
Those who favor genetics first argue on the basis of life’s remarkable complexity; they point to the astonishing intricacy of even the simplest living cell. Without
a genetic mechanism there would be no way to insure the faithful reproduction of
all that complexity. Metabolism without a genetic mechanism may be viewed as
nothing more than a collection of overactive chemicals.
Other scientists are persuaded by the principle that life emerged through stages
of increasing complexity. Metabolic chemistry, at its core, is vastly simpler than
genetic mechanisms because it requires relatively few small molecules that work
in concert to duplicate themselves. In this view the core metabolic cycle – the
citric acid cycle that lies at the heart of every modern cell’s metabolic processes –
survives as a biochemical fossil from life’s beginning. This comparatively simple
chemical cycle is an engine that can bootstrap all of life’s biochemistry, including
the key genetic molecules.
Origin-of-life scientists aren’t shy about voicing their opinions on the metabolism- vs. genetics-first problem, which will probably remain a central controversy
in the field for some time. Meanwhile, as this debate fuels animated discussions,
several groups of creative researchers are attempting to shed light on the issue by
devising self-replicating chemical systems –  metabolism in a test tube.
2.4.2  Self-replicating molecular systems
The simplest imaginable self-replicating system consists of one type of molecule
that makes copies of itself [93]. Under just the right chemical environment, such
an isolated molecule will become two copies, then four, then eight molecules, and
so on in a geometrical expansion. Such an “autocatalytic” molecule must act as
a template that attracts and assembles smaller building blocks from an appropriate chemical broth. Single self-replicating molecules are intrinsically complex in
structure, but organic chemists have managed to devise several varieties of these
curious beasts, including small peptides (made of amino acids) and short strands of
 DNA [94, 95, 96, 97, 98].

Robert M. Hazen

Nevertheless, these self-replicating molecules don’t meet anyone’s minimum
requirements for life on at least two counts. First, such a system requires a steady
input of smaller highly specialized molecules – synthetic chemicals that must be
supplied by the researchers. Under no plausible natural environment could these idiosyncratic “food” molecules arise independently in nature. Furthermore – and this is a
key point in distinguishing life from non-life – these self-replicating molecules can’t
change and evolve, any more than a Xerox copy can evolve from an original.
More relevant to biological  metabolism are systems of two or more molecules
that form a self-replicating cycle or network. In the simplest system, two molecules
(call them AA and BB) form from smaller feedstock molecules A and B. If AA
catalyzes the formation of BB, and BB in turn catalyzes the formation of AA, then
the system will sustain itself as long as researchers maintain a reliable supply of
food molecules A and B. Theorists elaborate on such a model with networks of
many molecules, each of which promotes the production of another species in the
system [99, 100].
What separates living systems from simple self-replicating collections of molecules?
In part it’s complexity; living systems require numerous interacting molecules. In
addition, a truly living metabolic cycle must incorporate a certain degree of sloppiness. Only through such variations can the system experiment with new, more efficient
reaction pathways and thus evolve.
A dramatic gap exists between plausible theory and actual experiment.
 Metabolism is a special kind of cyclical chemical process with two essential inputs.
Living cells undergo chemical reactions, not unlike burning in which two chemicals (oxygen and fuel) react and release energy. However, the trick in metabolism,
unlike an open fire, is to capture part of that released energy to make new useful
molecules that reinforce the cycle. So metabolism  requires a sequence of chemical
reactions that work in concert .
2.4.3  The iron-sulfur world
The theoretical and experimental pursuit of the  metabolism-first viewpoint is
exemplified by Günter Wächtershäuser’s iron-sulfur world hypothesis [44, 45, 46,
47, 48]. This origin-of-life scenario incorporates a strikingly original autotrophic,
metabolism -first model. According to Wächtershäuser, all of life’s essential  biomolecules are manufactured in place, as needed from the smallest of building blocks:
CO, H2O, NH3, H2S, and so forth. Chemical synthesis is accomplished stepwise, a
few atoms at a time.
The contrast between a heterotrophic versus an autotrophic origin is profound,
and represents a fundamental point of disagreement among origin-of-life researchers. On the one hand, supporters of a heterotrophic origin point out that it’s much

easier for an organism to use the diverse molecular products that are available in
the prebiotic soup, rather than make them all from scratch. Why go to the trouble
of synthesizing lots of amino acids if they’re already available in the environment?
In this sense, heterotrophic cells can be simpler than autotrophic cells because
they don’t require all of the biochemical machinery to manufacture amino acids,
carbohydrates, lipids, and so forth. One can thus argue that simpler heterotrophy
should come first.
Autotrophic advocates are equally insistent that true simplicity lies in building
molecules a few atoms at a time with just a few simple chemical reactions. Such
a mechanism, furthermore, possesses a significant philosophical advantage: auto­
trophism is deterministic. Rather than depending on the idiosyncrasies of a local
environment for biomolecular components, autotrophic organisms make them from
scratch the same way every time, on any viable planet or moon, in a predictable
chemical path. Such a philosophy leads to a startling conclusion. For advocates of
autotrophy the prebiotic soup is irrelevant to the origin of life. With autotrophy,
biochemistry is hard wired into the universe. The self-made cell emerges from geochemistry as inevitably as basalt or granite.
As with any metabolic strategy, the iron-sulfur world model requires a source of
energy, a source of molecules, and a self-replicating cycle.  Wächtershäuser’s model
relies on the abundant chemical energy of minerals that find themselves out of
equilibrium with their environment. He begins by suggesting that iron monosulfide
(FeS), a common mineral deposited in abundance at the mouths of many deep-sea
hydrothermal vents, is unstable with respect to the surrounding seawater. As a consequence, iron sulfide combines with the volcanic gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to
produce the mineral pyrite (FeS2) plus hydrogen gas (H2) and energy:
FeS + H2S → FeS2 + H2 + energy
Given that energetic boost, hydrogen reacts immediately with carbon dioxide (CO2)
to synthesize organic molecules such as formic acid (HCOOH):
energy + H2 + CO2 → HCOOH
Wächtershäuser envisions cascades of these reactions coupled to build up essential
organic molecules from CO2 and other simple gases.
Recent experiments lend support to the iron-sulfur world hypothesis, which
makes the unambiguous prediction that minerals promote a variety of organic
reactions. Experiments by Wächtershäuser and colleagues in Germany used iron,
nickel, and cobalt sulfides to synthesize acetate, an essential metabolic compound
with two carbon atoms that plays a central role in countless biochemical processes
[52]. They expanded on this success by adding amino acids to their experiments
and making peptides – yet another essential step to life [53, 101]. These and other

experiments lead to a firm conclusion: common sulfide minerals have the ability to
promote a variety of interesting organic synthesis reactions.
A centerpiece of the iron-sulfur world hypothesis is Günter Wächtershäuser’s
conviction that life began with a simple, self-replicating cycle of compounds similar to the one that lies at the heart of every cell’s metabolism – the “reductive
citric acid cycle.” But how did the first metabolic cycle operate without enzymes?
Some of the requisite steps, such as combining carbon dioxide and pyruvate to
make oxaloacetate, are energetically unlikely; if one step fails then the whole cycle
fails. One of the clever proposals in Günter Wächtershäuser’s model is that sulfide
minerals promote primordial metabolic reactions. In fact, many modern metabolic
enzymes have at their core a small cluster of iron or nickel and sulfur atoms – clusters
that look like tiny bits of sulfide minerals. Perhaps ancient minerals played the role
of enzymes.
Wächtershäuser’s  iron-sulfur world was manifest as flat life, which predated the
emergence of cells. The first self-replicating entity was a thin layer of chemical reactants on a sulfide mineral surface. The film grew laterally, spreading from mineral
grain to mineral grain as an invisibly thin organic film. Bits of these layers could
break off and reattach to other rocks to make clone-like colonies. Given time, different ­minerals might induce variations in the film, fostering new “species” of flat life.

2.4.4  The  RNA world
In spite of Wächtershäuser’s elaborate iron-sulfur world scenario and several competing variants of that model [102, 103], most origin experts dismiss a purely metabolic life form in favor of a genetics-first scenario. Even the simplest known cell
must pass volumes of information from one generation to the next, and the only
known way to store and copy that much information is with a genetic molecule like
 DNA or RNA.
California chemist  Leslie Orgel stated that the central dilemma in understanding a genetic origin of life is the identification of a stable, self-replicating genetic
molecule – a polymer that simultaneously carries the information to make copies
of itself and catalyzes that replication [91]. Accordingly, he catalogs four broad
approaches to the problem of jumpstarting such a genetic organism.
One possibility is a self-replicating peptide – a short sequence of amino acids
that emerged first and then “invented”  DNA. That’s an appealing idea because
amino acids are thought to have been widely available in the soup. The problem
is that, while cells have learned how to form ordered chain-like polymers, amino
acids on their own link together in irregular clusters of no obvious biological utility.
Alternatively, the simultaneous evolution of  proteins and  DNA seems even less likely
because it requires the emergence of two improbable molecules. Cairns-Smith’s clay

world scenario provides an intriguing third option, though one totally unsupported
by experimental evidence.
Consequently, the favored genetics origin model is based on a nucleic acid molecule like RNA – a polymer that acted both as a carrier of information and as a
catalyst that promoted  self-replication [104, 105, 106]. This idea received a boost
in the early 1980s with the discovery of ribozymes – genetic material that also
acts as a catalyst [107, 108, 109]. Modern life relies on two complexly intertwined
molecules,  DNA to carry information and  proteins to perform chemical functions.
This interdependence leads to the chicken–egg dilemma:  proteins make and maintain DNA, but DNA carries the instructions to make proteins. Which came first?
RNA, it turns out, has the potential to do both jobs .
The “RNA world” theory that quickly emerged champions the central role of
genetic material in the dual tasks of catalyst and information transfer [110, 111,
112]. Over the years “RNA world” has come to mean different things to different people, but three precepts are common to all versions: (1) once upon a time
RNA carried genetic information, (2) RNA replication followed the same rules as
modern DNA, by matching pairs of bases such as A-T and C-G, and (3)  proteins
were not involved in the process. The first life form in this scenario was simply a
self-replicating strand of RNA, perhaps enclosed in a protective lipid membrane.
According to most versions of this hypothesis,  metabolism emerged later as a
means to make the RNA replication process more efficient.
The RNA world model is not without its difficulties. Foremost among these
problems is the exceptional difficulty in the prebiotic synthesis of RNA [25, 111,
112, 113]. Many of the presumed proto-metabolic molecules are easily synthesized
in experiments that mimic prebiotic environments. RNA nucleotides, by contrast,
have never been synthesized from scratch. Furthermore, even if a prebiotic synthetic pathway to nucleotides could be found, a plausible mechanism to link those
nucleotides into an RNA strand has not been demonstrated. It is not obvious how
useful  catalytic RNA sequences would have formed spontaneously in any prebiotic
environment. Perhaps, some scientists speculate, a simpler nucleic acid preceded
RNA [7, 114, 115, 116].
Whatever the scenario – metabolism first or genetics first, on the ocean’s surface
or at a deep ocean vent – the origin of life required more than the replication of
chemicals. For a chemical system to be alive, it must display evolution by the process of natural selection.
2.5  The emergence of  natural selection
Molecular selection, the process by which a few key molecules earned key roles in
life’s origin, proceeded on many fronts. Some molecules were inherently unstable

or highly reactive and so they quickly disappeared from the scene. Other molecules easily dissolved in the oceans and so were effectively removed from contention. Still other molecular species may have sequestered themselves by bonding
strongly to surfaces of chemically unhelpful minerals or clumped together into
gooey masses of little use to emerging biology.
In every geochemical environment, each kind of organic molecule had its reliable sources and its inevitable sinks. For a time, perhaps for hundreds of millions
of years, a kind of molecular equilibrium was maintained as the new supply of each
species was balanced by its loss. Such an equilibrium features non-stop competition among molecules, to be sure, but the system does not evolve.
The first self-replicating molecules changed that equilibrium. Even a relatively unstable collection of molecules can be present in significant concentration if it learns how to make copies of itself. The first successful metabolic cycle
of molecules, for example, would have proven vastly superior to its individual
chemical neighbors at accumulating atoms and harnessing energy. But success
breeds competition. Inevitable slight variations in the self-replicating cycle, triggered by the introduction of new molecular species or by differences in environment, initiated an era of increased competition. More efficient cycles flourished
at the expense of the less efficient. Evolution by natural selection had begun on
Earth.
The simplest self-replicating molecular systems are not alive. Given all the time
in the world such systems won’t evolve. A more interesting possibility is an environment in which two or more self-replicating suites of molecules compete. These
dueling molecular networks vie for resources, mimicking life’s unceasing struggle
for survival. A stable system without competition, by contrast, has no incentive to
evolve.
Two common processes – variation and selection – provide a powerful mechanism for self-replicating systems to evolve. For a system to evolve it must first display
a range of variations. Natural systems display random variations through mutations,
which are undirected changes in the chemical makeup of key biomolecules. Most
variations harm the organism and are doomed to failure. Once in a while, however,
a random mutation leads to an improved trait – a more efficient metabolism, better
camouflage, swifter locomotion, or greater tolerance for extreme environmental
conditions. Such beneficial variations are more likely to survive in the competitive
natural world – such variations fuel the process of natural selection.
Competition drives the emergence of natural selection . Such behavior appears to
be inevitable in any self-replicating chemical system in which resources are limited
and some molecules have the ability to mutate. Over time, more efficient networks
of autocatalytic molecules will increase in concentration at the expense of less efficient networks. In such a competitive milieu the emergence of increasing molecular

complexity is inevitable; new chemical pathways overlay the old. So it is that life
has continued to evolve over the past four billion years of Earth history.

2.5.1  Molecular evolution in the lab
Laboratory studies of molecular evolution have led to methods for the artificial
evolution of molecules that accomplish specific chemical tasks. Harvard biologist
Jack Szostak, for example, has explored this approach in attempts to design an
evolving synthetic laboratory life form [117]. Szostak focuses on devising chains of
RNA that perform one key task such as copying other RNA molecules [118].
Szostak and co-workers [119, 120, 121, 122] tackle RNA evolution by first generating a collection of trillions of random RNA sequences, each about 120 nucleo­
tides (RNA “letters”) long. The vast majority of these chains do nothing, but a few
are able to perform a specific task, for example grabbing onto another molecule
that has been attached to the sides of a glass beaker. Flushing out the beaker with
water removes all of the unattached RNA strands and thus selects and concentrates
RNA sequences bonded to the target. These select strands are then copied with
a controlled rate of mutational errors to produce a new batch of trillions of RNA
sequences, some of which are even better suited to attach to the beaker’s sides.
Repeating this process improves the speed and accuracy with which the RNA
latches onto the target molecules.
An enticing target of molecular evolution research is self-replicating RNA – a
big molecule that carries genetic information, catalyzes its own reproduction, and
mutates and evolves as well. But no plausible geochemical environment could
have fed such an unbound molecule, nor would it have survived long under most
natural chemical conditions. Szostak’s group ultimately hopes to encapsulate such
a replicative RNA strand in a lipid vesicle to synthesize a self-replicating cell-like
entity [117].
The synthesis of an “RNA organism” would provide a degree of credibility to
the RNA world hypothesis, that a strand of RNA  (or some chemically more stable
precursor genetic molecule) formed the basis of the first evolving, self-replicating
chemical system. But lab life will not have emerged spontaneously from chemical
reactions among the simple molecular building blocks of the prebiotic Earth, nor
would such an object be capable of reproduction without a steady supply of laboratory chemicals. Deep mysteries will remain.
2.6  Three scenarios for the origin of life
What do we know so far? Abundant organic molecules must have been synthesized
and accumulated in a host of productive prebiotic environments. Subsequently,

biomolecular systems including lipid membranes and genetic polymers might have
formed through self-organization and by selection on mineral surfaces. As molecular complexity increased, it seems plausible that simple metabolic cycles of selfreplicating molecules emerged, as did self-replicating genetic molecules.
The greatest gap in understanding life’s origin lies in the transition from a moreor-less static geochemical world with an abundance of interesting organic molecules, to an evolving biochemical world. How that transition occurred may be
reduced to a choice among three possible scenarios [7]:
1. Life began with  metabolism and genetic molecules were incorporated later. Following
Günter Wächtershäuser’s hypothesis, life began autotrophically. Life’s first building
blocks were the simplest of molecules, while minerals provided chemical energy. In this
scenario a self-replicating chemical cycle akin to the reverse citric acid cycle became
established on a mineral surface. All subsequent chemical complexities, including genetic mechanisms and encapsulation into a cell-like structure, arose through  natural
selection as variants of the cycle competed for resources and the system became more
efficient. In this scenario, life first emerged as an evolving chemical coating on rocks.
2. Life began with self-replicating genetic molecules and  metabolism was incorporated
later. Following the RNA world hypothesis, life began heterotrophically. Organic
molecules in the prebiotic soup, perhaps aided by clays or some other template, selforganized into information-rich polymers. Eventually, one of these polymers, perhaps
surrounded by a lipid membrane, acquired the ability to self-replicate. All subsequent
chemical complexities, including metabolic cycles, arose through  natural selection as
variants of the genetic polymer became more efficient at  self-replication. In this scenario, life emerged as an evolving polymer with a functional genetic sequence.
3. Life began as a cooperative chemical phenomenon between  metabolism and genetics.
A third possible scenario rests on the possibility that neither primitive metabolic cycles
(which lack the means of faithful self-replication) nor primitive genetic molecules (which
are not very stable and lack a reliable source of chemical energy) could have progressed far
by themselves. If, however, a crudely self-replicating genetic molecule became attached
to a crudely functioning surface-bound metabolic coating, then a kind of cooperative
chemistry might have kicked in. The genetic molecule might have used chemical energy
produced by metabolites to make copies of itself, while protecting itself by binding to
the surface. Any subsequent variations of the genetic molecule that fortuitously offered
protection for itself or for the metabolites, or improved the chemical efficiency of the system, would have been preserved preferentially. Gradually, both the genetic and metabolic
components would have become more efficient and more interdependent.

Scientists do not yet know the answer, but they are poised to find out. Whatever
the process, ultimately competition began to drive the emergence of ever more elaborate chemical cycles by the process of  natural selection. Inexorably, life emerged,
never to relinquish its foothold on Earth .

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson:
changing  definitions of life viewed
in a historical context
James E. Strick

3.1  Introduction
 The origin of life has always been a topic charged with religious import. This
chapter aims to survey briefly some origin-of-life ideas over time; first, if we look
in detail at how the debate over life’s origin played out between  Darwin and his supporters, we will see a clear example of this. Note that I said Darwin’s supporters,
rather than his opponents. We expect a story about the new evolutionary science to
include much heated objection from religious groups, for whom so many aspects
of Darwin’s theory produced problems. But a look at how divisive the issue was
among the Darwinians themselves is an even more complex and enlightening
story, perhaps of more relevance to scientists in their own work.
By the 1850s,  William Benjamin Carpenter, Professor of physiology at the Royal
Institution of London, believed, as did  Herbert Spencer, that the vital force of living things was completely interconvertible with forces from non-living nature such
as heat, electricity, kinetic energy, etc. However, also like Spencer and a number
of others in the Darwinian camp, Carpenter believed that the conversion of heat or
chemical energy into vital energy could only be accomplished through the agency
of already living matter; in other words, that non-living matter could never organize
itself into living matter capable of generating vital force [1]. This served as a convenient theoretical barrier separating modern physiology and its ally, the new evolution theory, from the bête noir of spontaneous generation. (Spontaneous generation
meant life arising directly from non-living matter; the idea had become associated
through Buffon,  Lamarck, and others with the politics of revolutionary France. In
Britain the most prominent spontaneous generation advocate was Charles Darwin’s
early mentor, the Lamarckian  Robert Grant, also a supporter of radical political
reforms.) Carpenter’s spin on how, despite the conservation of energy principle,

there was still a qualitative difference between vital and non-living forces, did
keep the politically unsavory doctrine of spontaneous generation at arm’s length
from the new professional scientists among whom Darwin was a leader. However,
it simultaneously posed a new conundrum for the emerging life sciences centered
around  Darwinism: it seemed to prove an absolute, uncrossable divide between the
living and non-living worlds, leaving no alternative but a supernatural explanation
for the first  origin of life on Earth.
That suited Carpenter,  a very religious man, just fine; but others were worried
about the contradiction. Many younger supporters of Darwin’s theory were enthusiastic about its charter of seeming to banish supernatural explanations from life
sciences and of establishing new proof for the unbroken continuity of nature. These
included  T. H. Huxley and his protégés, the next generation of rising Darwinian talent, prominent among them the physician and medical researcher  Henry Charlton
Bastian. Bastian was deeply interested in the problem of consciousness; and Bastian,
more than any of the other young Darwinians, became fascinated with the origin of
life itself and convinced that the question could be approached by experiment in a
laboratory. While some Darwinians imagined even the simplest cells must require
a long, gradual process of formation, Bastian described experiments that he thought
showed cells emerging very rapidly, in a few days, from non-living starting materials.
In hermetically sealed containers, Bastian boiled infusions of different materials, both
organic and inorganic, then observed the cooled contents microscopically and saw a
profusion of different living microorganisms. At this time many observers  thought
the term “spontaneous generation” to automatically imply such rapid formation. By
1870 he claimed experimental proof for spontaneous generation and argued this was
important support for the Darwinian theory.1
Those liberal-minded Christians who sought some kind of accommodation
between the new evolutionary science and their religious beliefs were an audience
of great interest to Darwin. Hence, in On the Origin of Species [2], Darwin went
out of his way, even misrepresenting his own views on life’s origin, to use language
that gave those readers some breathing room. He devoted only one sentence in the
entire book to  the origin of life, and there he said:
… I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived
on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first
breathed (p. 484).

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson

Many of Darwin’s friends criticized him for this dissembling, as did Richard Owen
while touting an alternative evolution theory to Darwin’s. In private Darwin repeatedly regretted having weakened the clarity of his position by using such Biblical
language. As he put it, with sarcasm toward Owen’s spontaneous generation concept, which likened snot to protoplasm:

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

It will be some time before we see “slime, snot, or protoplasm” … generating a new animal.
But I have long regretted that I truckled to public opinion, and used the Pentateuchal term
of creation, by which I really meant “appeared” by some wholly unknown process. It is
mere rubbish, thinking at present of the  origin of life; one might as well think of the origin
of matter [3].2

But clearly Darwin felt that, at least in the short run, it was unwise to alienate so
large a pool of potential allies during the early years of controversy over his theory.
An indicator that Darwin agrees with the criticism of his friends is that he dropped
the entire phrase “into which life was first breathed by the Creator” from the third
edition of Origin, which appeared in April 1861. But, tellingly, Darwin did not
insert in its place a more forthright explanation of the kind he had given in private.
He simply left out any comment on the matter of how that “one primordial form”
had arisen. And despite much private speculation, he never made any further public
comment on the topic to his dying day in 1882. He left the passage untouched in all
remaining editions of the book (the last revision was the sixth edition of 1872).
I have demonstrated elsewhere that  Bastian’s experiments on the possibility of
spontaneous generation were widely seen in the 1870s as relevant to much broader,
socially charged questions such as the nature of consciousness; the interchangeability
of “vital force,” and especially “nerve force,” with other physical and chemical forces
in nature; the mechanism of heredity, and of memory generally; cell theory; and the
origin of diseases, both contagious and degenerative [4].3 Clearly, a lot was at stake,
and some of it, most deeply of all, was inseparably tied to whether there was any need
at all for a Creator God. To those who opposed  Darwinian evolution on religious
grounds, it was obvious that Darwin and  Huxley implied a naturalistic  origin of life,
just as it was obvious to Bastian and his supporters [5, 64]. But for religious critics of
evolution this meant an even more important reason to oppose  Darwinism.
Thus, in 1870 when Bastian  began to publicly press the implications of
Darwinism for a materialistic origin of life, he created great difficulty for many of

first breathed.”

those liberal Christians who had, up until that point, felt they could enthusiastically
support Darwin.5 In one public venue  Frederick Barnard, president of Columbia
University, wrote that he found  Bastian’s Beginnings of Life so convincing, that
educated Christians must now feel forced to choose between Darwinism and a universe with no Creator God.6 Surely Barnard was not the only such person, but his
remarkable frankness bears quoting at some length, to show just why Darwin and
 Huxley tried to avoid pushing the issue as forcefully as Bastian. Barnard said: 
We are told, indeed, that the acceptance of these views need not shake our faith in the
existence of an Almighty Creator. It is beautifully explained to us how they ought to give
us more elevated and more worthy conceptions of the modes by which He works His
will in the visible creation. We learn that our complex organisms are none the less the
work of His hands because they have been evolved by an infinite series of changes from
microscopic gemmules, and that these gemmules themselves have taken on their forms
under the influence of the physical forces of light and heat and attraction acting on brute
mineral matter. Rather it should seem we are a good deal more so. This kind of teaching
is heard in our day even from the theologians. … It is indeed a grand conception which
regards the Deity as conducting the work of His creation by means of those all-pervading
influences which we call the forces of nature; but it leaves us profoundly at a loss to
explain the wisdom or the benevolence which brings every day into life such myriads of
sentient and intelligent beings, only that they may perish on the morrow of their birth.
But this is not all. If these doctrines are true, all talk of creation or methods of creation
becomes absurdity; for just as certainly as they are true, God himself is impossible. … 
But we are told it is unphilosophical, in the pursuit of truth, to concern ourselves about
consequences. … To this canon I am willing to subscribe up to a certain point. But if, in
my study of nature, I find the belief forced upon me that my own conscious spirit … is but
a mere vapor, which appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away forever, that is a
truth … for which I shall never thank the science which has taught it me. Much as I love
truth in the abstract, I love my hope of immortality still more; and if the final outcome
of all the boasted discoveries of modern science is to disclose to men that they are more
evanescent than the shadow of the swallow’s wing upon the lake, … give me then, I pray,
no more science. Let me live on, in my simple ignorance, as my fathers lived before me,
and when I shall at length be summoned to my final repose, let me still be able to fold the
drapery of my couch about me, and lie down to pleasant, even though they be deceitful
dreams  [7].7

Spontaneous generation seemed to bring home to many evolutionists the stark
materialist implications of what  Huxley had called “the physical basis of life.”

From Aristotle to Darwin, to Freeman Dyson

51

Among the younger Darwinians,  Alfred Russel Wallace came out early and
very strongly in favor of Bastian’s arguments, in one of the first reviews to appear
of  The Beginnings of Life [8]. The medical journals also applauded the strengthening of  Darwinism by Bastian’s experiments, emphasizing that he extended the logical “continuity in nature” so important to the new scientific  naturalism, bridging
the arbitrary gap between living and non-living matter.
At this,  Huxley and his colleague, physicist  John Tyndall, began to campaign
more vigorously for a unified front among Darwin supporters. They thought  Bastian
must be a careless experimenter (though on many of the most important points they
were wrong); thus they adopted a strategy of severing the linkage between evolution and present-day spontaneous generation, and they declared Bastian and all his
supporters, de facto,  “non-Darwinians.” Huxley in his famous BAAS address [9],
 “Biogenesis and Abiogenesis,” first publicly declared that Darwinian science did
indeed imply a naturalistic origin of life; he called this  “abiogenesis” to make clear
that it differed from spontaneous generation in that it could only have occurred
in the Earth’s distant past.8 It is from this time that  Darwin wrote privately to
Hooker:

It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of living organisms are now
present, which could ever have been present. But if (and oh what a big if) one could conceive in some warm little pond with the right amounts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, –
light, heat, electricity, etc. present, thus a protein compound was chemically formed, ready
to undergo itself such complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly
devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures had
formed [10].

Clearly, Darwin’s private views were highly sympathetic to a naturalistic  origin of
life, at least on the primitive Earth. And he continued to follow the debates between
Bastian and Huxley with great interest. But he certainly never judged it appropriate
to make his own views public, even when Bastian’s career was nearly ruined by
Huxley’s campaign to undermine his scientific reputation. The reaction of  Barnard
and others like him can only have confirmed for Darwin how important his original choice had been to keep silent, or even at first throw a bone to Christians on the
origin-of-life issue. Thus until at least the 1870s, the scientists themselves stepped
very carefully around religious implications of their work.

meaning, i.e. life only from already existing life. Huxley’s rhetorical success in making his terms stick (and
thereby distancing proper evolutionary science from the older doctrine of “spontaneous generation” and its
unsavory associations, was no small part of his ability to vanquish Bastian. So much so that most textbooks
today include “biogenesis” among terms Huxley is credited with coining.

Huxley’s position on abiogenesis from 1870 [11]. Thomson was a deeply religious
man and a committed opponent of Darwinism. Not surprisingly, in their personal
correspondence the Darwinians made fun of Thomson’s recourse to such an unscientific hypothesis. From their point of view, he was abandoning his usual scientific
critical faculties because he was so desperate to find a way to avoid the implication
of abiogenesis.  In this early incarnation, Huxley  thought Thomson’s  version of
 “panspermia” merely pushed the problem back to another planet but was no real
solution to the origin-of-life question.9
As  I ris Fry has pointed out, the Pope, even in his 1997 statement declaring that
evolution was supported by enough facts that it was now “more than a hypothesis,” still made it clear that he was not ready to accept a theory of evolution
based on a materialist interpretation, but only one that was spiritualist in its
philosophy (i.e. one that acknowledges that if a human body takes its form from
pre-existing living matter, the soul was immediately created by God). Fry’s book
 T he Emergence of Life on Earth [12] offers an excellent summary of how varied
Christian theological positions could be over time, however. Early Church doctrine was dominated for hundreds of years by the thinking of  St. Augustine, for
example. Quoting Fry,
According to Augustine, continuing spontaneous generation is made possible by a divine
decree, issued at the moment of creation and active forevermore, under whose power
the generation of living creatures from the earth and various organic materials persists.
Augustine referred to biblical commands such as “Let the land produce vegetation,” “Let
the water teem with living creatures,” and “Let the land produce living creatures according
to their kinds.” At the first event of creation, he said, God formed the “seed-principles” of
all the species, which are the potentials of all living creatures to come. These potentials
materialize throughout the history of the Earth according to a preordained plan, in both
sexual and spontaneous generation, when the circumstances are favorable [12] (p. 18).

Fry  points out that, even when Thomas Aquinas modified this doctrine by
­combining Augustine’s “seed-principles” with Aristotelian philosophy, arguing for
much more active, direct intervention by God, still, under both Augustine’s and
Aquinas’s doctrines
and for centuries thereafter, no doubt was raised as to the possibility of spontaneous generation. This harmony between the belief in spontaneous generation and various Christian
doctrines is noteworthy, especially since it tends to be forgotten following the radical
change in the church’s attitude toward this issue that took place at the end of the seventeenth

century. Until that change there was no reason – neither in the way organisms were thought
of, nor in the predominant philosophy of nature – that would prevent the church from supporting the widespread belief in spontaneous generation [12] (p. 19).

3.2  Changing concepts of life
Talking about the  origin of life, then, is still potentially theologically charged,
based upon how one defines life. Now for our (by no means exhaustive) sampling
of concepts of what life actually is. Here I hope to show that broader historical context (than religious implications) can be just as informative about trends in defining
life. A useful survey of numerous definitions of life up until the end of the nineteenth century can be found in the opening pages of the 1899  F. J. Allen article
“What is life?”[13].
 Louis Pasteur argued as early as 1860 that optical activity is “the only distinct
line of demarcation that we can show today between dead and living matter.” (He
believed that “cosmic asymmetric forces” were responsible for this.) One of Allen’s
most useful observations is that most of the attempted definitions have some merit,
but they all tried to find a single key formulation to capture an extremely complex,
many-sided phenomenon. “Life,” he says, “is too complex to be described in a concise aphorism” [13] (p. 45). Pasteur was surely pointing out one of the most crucial
features of living systems, but as the 1997 work of Cronin and Pizzarello on non
50:50 enantiomers (the opposite right- and left-handed mirror image versions in
which many organic molecules occur) in extraterrestrial amino acids from meteorites has shown, even that formerly sharp line of demarcation has begun to blur
into a spectrum [14].
Allen then plunges into a review of what is known about the biochemistry of metabolism and a very modern-sounding discussion of the central role of
­“energy-traffic” in cells. He is impressed with the 1875 theory of the German physiologist Eduard Pflüger, that cyanogen is the defining unstable compound of living
reactions, and, ironically enough, notwithstanding his opening caveat, Allen soon
arrives at his own pet, too-concise formulation, which he calls a law: that “every
vital action involves the passage of oxygen either to or from nitrogen” [13] (p. 52).10
He cites another German, Oscar Loew, who has recently suggested that the basis

Gesam. Physiol. (Pflügers Archiv) 10 (1875), 251–278. Pflüger’s concepts were still influential, more recently,
in the ideas on biogenesis developed by Wilhelm Reich. See, for example, Reich. The Cancer Biopathy
[1948] (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1973), p. 9; also S. Kramer. quoted in Origins of Life II, ed.

of life is continuous atomic motion within large unstable organic molecules. Allen
commends the theory for explaining some phenomena, but thinks “Dr. Loew does
not lay enough stress on the functions of nitrogen, to which I personally trace so
many of the phenomena of life. … It is chiefly owing to the instability of nitrogen
compounds that continuous atomic motion is possible” [13] (p. 55). He gives priority to N, among the CHON.
Here we are seeing a transition to a new, biochemical way of talking about the
most basic characteristics of life, both structural and metabolic. But Allen’s attempt
to hold on to some single sine qua non of life represents the deep grip of a late
nineteenth century scientific gestalt that we need to look at more closely, in order
to understand why biochemical ideas that in some ways sound so modern are still
shaped by it. From the 1860s through the first decade of the twentieth century theories abounded as to the simplest “living unit.” From Thomas Graham’s colloid,
containing “energia,” to Huxley’s “protoplasm,” to  Darwin’s “gemmules” of pangenesis, to Hering and Haeckel’s “plastidules,” to Nägeli’s “micelles,” to Verworn’s
“biogen,” in many ways Allen’s  focus on nitrogen as the crucial “living element”
is in this tradition. These theories reflect the fact that from 1860 to perhaps as late
as 1910, “explaining life” was interpreted by most investigators to require addressing all or most of the parts of a large problem complex. This included generation,
development, inheritance, sensation or irritability, evolution, and in some cases the
postulate of a specific biological energy.11 The gradual teasing apart of the strands
of this once-unified problem complex, for instance the separation, from about
1910–1920 of  transmission genetics from embryology/development and its more
inclusive notion of  “inheritance,” greatly altered discussions of the origin of life.
The effect of the new discipline of transmission genetics,  most of all due to
the work of the T. H. Morgan Drosophila school, began to be clearly seen in the
August 1926 paper of  H. J. Muller  “The gene as the basis of life”12 and the 1929
paper of  J. B. S. Haldane “The origin of life” [15]. In Muller’s paper, as John Farley
has pointed out, defining the sudden appearance of a gene molecule as the sharp
point at which life emerged has the paradoxical effect of reviving the supposedly
most outdated feature of the old “spontaneous generation” doctrine: namely the
idea that anything as complex as life could possibly arise in a sudden rapid event. In
 A. I. Oparin’s writings from the 1920s, a gradual chemical evolutionary process is
put forward as much more plausible; i.e. the idea of the emergence of life through a

mind or at least removed this wording, by the second edition in 1920. But it is from Kammerer that Wilhelm
Reich appears to have drawn most directly in positing a specific biological energy.

series of transitional stages. While Haldane was interested in the latest ideas about
 genes, he leaned more toward the Oparin approach:

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

In the present state of our ignorance we may regard the gene either as a tiny organism
which can divide in the environment provided by the rest of the cell; or as a bit of machinery which the “living” cell copies at each division. The truth is probably somewhere in
between these two hypotheses. … Unless a living creature is a piece of dead matter plus a
soul (a view which finds little support in modern biology) something of the following kind
must be true. A simple organism must consist of parts A, B, C, D, and so on, each of which
can multiply only in the presence of all, or almost all, of the others [15]  (p. 6).

Here Haldane  makes an early but cogent statement on what are now called
“emergent properties.”
A brief look, now, at two recent books will quickly bring out numerous points
about trends in defining life in the past 40–50 years and the historical context in
which these trends developed. The books are  Freeman Dyson’s  Origins of Life and
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry’s  The Origins of Life: from the Birth of Life to the
Origin of Language [16, 17].13
Being a physicist allows Dyson to see [16] (pp. 6–7) the extent to which much
thinking among biologists is predisposed by their own philosophical assumptions;
as for instance, why such an overwhelming majority of life scientists raised since
Watson and Crick believe information-carrying molecules more fundamental to
life than biochemical metabolism. This, despite the fact that, ever since researchers have seen the origin of life to be predicated upon the origin of  DNA,  RNA, or
some other more primitive information-carrying molecule, the result has been the
chicken–egg problem because of the interdependence of  proteins and nucleic acids
in extant cells. Dyson is less aware, or at least does not stop to comment on, the
degree to which his own reasoning [16] (pp. 7–8) is being guided just as forcefully
by notions about “hardware” and “software” inherited from the culture of computer technology. This is not to imply that use of these analogies in thinking about
living systems is necessarily faulty. But rather, just as the dominance of machines
in scientific cultures cannot be said to be historically unrelated to the growth of the
mechanistic view of life from 1850–1950, one ought at least to note that the ideas
of hardware and software are not merely disconnected intellectual “ideas” floating
around, but also fundamentally cultural resources, being drawn upon here by scientists. Thus, it is worth asking the question: do these ideas come into the scientific
arena freighted with any other interesting cultural or philosophical baggage? More
on this later.
 I survey more broadly the discussions of a definition of life and research into its origins in S. Dick and
J. Strick. The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers
University Press, 2004), especially chapters 3–5.

Dyson emphasizes the need to distinguish between replication and reproduction,
in order to break the logical “catch-22” deadlock that results when one considers
DNA- or RNA-centered systems to be the sine qua non of life. Dyson gives Von
Neumann credit for emphasizing the distinction between replication and metabolism. This is the most significant distinction Dyson rightly emphasizes in his book.
But one can only wonder why he lauds Schrödinger and Von Neumann’s early and
vague approaches to this distinction, while studiously avoiding mention of  Sidney
Fox and his school – those who first made the issue of “proteins first” vs. what
they called “the nucleic acid monopoly” central in the origin-of-life debate. Of
course, the two big name physicists have become revered in science (and Dyson
himself is a physicist), while Fox  was a protein chemist who eventually became
marginalized by the mainstream origin-of-life community.14 So if one is constructing a ­“forerunners” pedigree for one’s most important idea, perhaps the temptation
is overwhelming to attribute that idea to winners and silently pass over losers,
especially if one at the outset intends to write a highly condensed narrative that
disclaims any attempt at comprehensiveness. From a historian’s point of view, this
practice is in itself an object of study.
Dyson points out that Schrödinger saw biology through the eyes of the physicist-turned-biologist Max Delbrück and historians have elaborated at some length
on the construction of a master narrative of the history of molecular biology that
emphasizes only the line from Schrödinger, Delbrück, and Salvador Luria (the
team which in the early 1940s famously began experiments on bacteriophage genetics) to Watson and Crick. Dyson  says that thus Delbrück’s focus on replication
(and later on nucleic acids) as the central feature of the origin of life gained undue
prominence in the field and came to dominate the mindset of most researchers.
This insight into “paradigms” and their control of thinking in the field has been
stated repeatedly over the last twenty-five years.15
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry’s The Origins of Life sets out to describe and
explain what they plausibly argue are the eight major qualitative transitions that
have occurred in the history of life since the origin of replicating molecules.16
The book is an eloquent and very illuminating analysis of these transitions and
of some very important parallel trends among them [17] (pp. 19–25). But as a
result of such breadth of conceptual reach, it manages to survey only somewhat

Biosphere, 29 (1999), 109–112, 110. Fox’s work, as well as the process of marginalizing him, are discussed

superficially the origin of life per se. The major transitions they address are:
replicating molecules → populations of molecules in compartments; independent replicators → chromosomes;  RNA as gene and enzyme →  DNA and protein;
prokaryote → eukaryote; asexual clones → sexual populations; protists → animals,
plants, and fungi; solitary individuals → colonies; primate societies → human societies
and the origin of language.
In The Origins of Life, immediately from the first page, the focus is on information. The question of  metabolism being of equal importance, let alone first in time
(as in Dyson), is very briefly raised [17] (p. 12), only to be dismissed or minimized:
their overall usage betrays a strong bias toward an “information-first” view of life.
Their approach clearly assumes that life is synonymous with replication.17
There is no more historical a phenomenon in modern biology than the dialectically related rise of information theory and computers, and the simultaneous importation of such analysis into biological thinking, beginning no later than
Schrödinger’s 1944 work What Is Life?18  Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry tackle
this strikingly parallel development of concepts right away. It would seem strange
or incomprehensible to  Darwin, they say [17] (p. 2), that template reproduction
allows transmission of instructions in a homogeneous-looking, as yet unformed
egg or zygote. The idea is much less strange to us because “we are familiar with the
idea that patterns of magnetism on a magnetic tape can carry the instructions for
producing a symphony.” Indeed, they close their book with a tantalizing guess that
the move to transmitting information in electronic form may be potentially a transition on the scale of the other major transitions around which the book is framed. It
is astute of the authors to recognize how much our cultural experience enables our
view, especially on questions of such fundamental importance as “what is life?”
However, being more or less complete advocates of the information-first approach
to conceptualizing life, they seem to miss the other implication of the power of historical context. If our cultural experience enables our view, it also simultaneously
constrains it. The primacy of computers and electronic information in our lives
makes images of “programming” of instincts, “hard-wiring” of certain traits, etc.,
highly compelling metaphors for how we think about “life” in late twentieth century, high-tech Western society. But these metaphors tend to channel one’s thinking
strongly, above and beyond the actual experimental evidence, as in the nature–
nurture debate where “master molecule” and “inborn hard-wiring” metaphors have

boosted the stock of biological determinism far above even the rapidly growing
knowledge-base of molecular genetics. We may well reflect on the dominance of
such models, when they say [17] (p. 13) “a living being resembles a computer, rather
than just a program, although it has its own program as subsystem.” The irony of
the back-and-forth relations between culture and nature is never more provocative
than in this passage [17] (pp. 12–13), where computers and computer “viruses” are
used as the standard against which to evaluate whether biological viruses should
be thought of as truly alive. Is this not putting the cart before the horse in some
fundamental ontological sense? One is reminded of N. W. Pirie’s 1937 remark:

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

When one is asked whether a filter-passing virus is living or dead the only sensible answer
is: “I don’t know; we know a number of things it will do and a number of things it won’t,
and if some commission will define the word ‘living’ I will try to see how the virus fits
into the definition.” His answer as a rule does not satisfy the questioner, who generally
has strong but unformulated opinions about what he means by the words living and dead.
The virus worker may then be told, to take one example out of many equally foolish, that
a certain virus cannot be living because its physical properties enable us to investigate it
in some detail [18] (p. 12).

As we shall see in origin-of-life debates, the possibly crucial question that gets
drowned out by talk of the primacy of information (and thus, of nucleic acids) is:
can there be any other central characteristic of living systems as fundamental as,
or perhaps even more fundamental than, information? Granted,  Maynard Smith
and  Szathmáry give a brilliant and powerful analysis of events since the evolution of information-carrying molecules. But their bias leaves us with the chicken–
egg problem: if  metabolism is dominated mostly by  proteins, but is a prerequisite
for the functioning of nucleic acid information molecules, how can a system like
our current living cell, even the simplest prokaryote, with each of these two parts
totally dependent upon the other, ever have evolved in the first place? (In this way,
giving primacy to nucleic acids/information plays into the hands of  creationists.)
This is the issue upon which Dyson’s book is so focused.
Not that Dyson is the first to raise this issue. Ever since Harvard biochemist
Leonard Troland’s 1914 [19] paper emphasizing autocatalytic enzymes and  Muller’s
1926 [20] gene-first response, this tension has been a central focus of debate and
discussion in the origin-of-life literature. Noted advocates toward Muller’s  end of
the spectrum have included Norman Horowitz and  Carl Sagan. Toward the opposite end have been  A. I. Oparin, J. D. Bernal, N. W. Pirie, and  Sidney Fox. The boom
of interest in ribozymes and the “RNA world,” beginning with  Thomas Cech’s
1982 discovery of  catalytic RNA molecules, was precisely because it was hoped
this phenomenon would finally offer a way out of the impasse that dominated much
of twentieth century discussion. If the simplest nucleic acid information molecules
can also simultaneously perform the enzyme role, previously thought only to be a

property of proteins, then  catalytic RNA molecules could be the “missing link”
bridging the gap between these two now separate but interdependent functions.
 Maynard Smith and  Szathmáry clearly hope [17] ribozymes offered the solution
to the catch-22. But this now seems to have been excessively optimistic [21].19 For,
while  RNA does seem to have the dual capabilities to bridge the gap, its monomers are so difficult to form spontaneously, and are so short-lived under primitive
Earth conditions, that the question of how to get from an abiotic world to the RNA
world is not much easier to solve than before the RNA world transitional stage was
known.20 Information is surely one of the fundamental issues for living systems as
we know them, but we are still unclear as to whether it came first or is the sine qua
non of the first life or its molecular predecessors.  
In conclusion, I hope this chapter has demonstrated the need to look at the religious/theological context as well as the broader historical/cultural context in order
to begin to understand how ideas about defining life and life’s origins have changed
over time. Since the theory was first discussed, common cultural assumptions about
the nature of life and/or common religious assumptions about its origin have been
prominent forces shaping the conceptions of the scientific community.

 Philosophical aspects of the origin-of-life
problem: the emergence of life and the
nature of science

4.1  Introduction
At a public lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, the renowned French scientist  Louis
Pasteur raised the fundamental philosophical question pertaining to the origin of
life: can matter organize itself to form a living system? Pasteur answered this question with a decisive no. He was referring both to the emergence of life on the primordial Earth and to the possibility of “spontaneous generation” – the formation of
living organisms out of matter here and now. Life, Pasteur believed, was originally
created by God and organisms are subsequently born only from parents.1
Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the German philosopher  Immanuel
Kant had also pondered the question of the nature of biological organization and
its emergence from matter. Unlike other physical objects, Kant noted, an organism
is an interactive system in which parts and whole are reciprocally dependent.2 This
circular, self-reproducing nature defines a living system and the critical question is
whether we can understand the production of such an organized, functional whole
in causal, materialistic terms [1] (77: 293).
For Kant , the idea of physical principles of self-organization, working mechanistically without any guiding plan and yet capable of producing an organized whole,
was inconceivable. Hence, the very possibility of the emergence of life from matter seemed to him absurd [1] (80:305, note 5; 81:311). Although not sharing Kant’s

more complex than apparent from the standard Pasteur’s scientific biography. See G. L. Geison. The Private
Science of Louis Pasteur (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995), pp. 133–138.

This unique nature of organisms was evident to any keen observer of the living world long before the establishment of modern biology. The most notable manifestation of this awareness is to be found in the fourth century
BCE in the biological treatises of Aristotle. See M. C. Nussbaum. Aristotle on teleological explanations. In
Aristotle’s De Motu Animalium: Text with Translation, Commentary, and Interpretive Essays (Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 76–80.

and Pasteur’s  convictions, most scientists toward the end of the nineteenth century
nevertheless preferred not to deal with the origin-of-life problem. Following the
growth of cytological knowledge and the rise of Biochemistry and Genetics, the
realization of the enormous complexity of the cell seemed to have put a ban on
research of this subject, turning it into a scientific taboo [2] (p. 494).
A serious change in attitude emerged in the twentieth century. It was expressed
in the formulation of new theories on the emergence of life, and by the middle of the
century, in the establishment of a scientific discipline devoted to the subject. These
developments reflected the accumulation of new scientific data in biology and chemistry and in many other scientific fields, such as astronomy and geology. However,
this breakthrough could not have been made without the radical change in the conception of the living world produced by  Darwin’s  theory of evolution and coming
into maturity in the twentieth century. In On the Origin of Species [3], published in
1859, Darwin did not discuss the question of the  origin of life. In his private letters
he expressed the feeling that contemporary scientific knowledge was far from sufficient to deal with this difficult problem [4]. He assumed that a single form, or a few
original living forms, existed on the primordial Earth and explained the evolution of
the whole tree of life from “so simple a beginning” [3] (p. 470).3 Yet, it was evident
to Darwin’s supporters and opponents alike that a consistent  theory of evolution
implied that life had formed in the ancient past from inorganic matter through natural processes. The naturalistic character of  Darwin’s theory stemmed mainly from
his major explanation of the phenomena of evolution, the mechanism of  natural
selection. This and other evolutionary mechanisms were thought to be the result of
natural, material processes with no recourse to a supernatural, purposive power.
The general philosophical postulate asserting that organized living systems
emerged on Earth through physical and chemical mechanisms is supported by science
today and is a crucial part of the evolutionary worldview. This worldview emphasizes
with equal force both continuity and novelty. It is distinct from the  creationist view,
which maintains an unbridgeable gap between matter and life that is overcome only
by an intervening transcendent divine agent. It is also different from earlier simplistic
mechanistic concepts that ignored the unique features of living systems. Origin-oflife research focuses on the physical and chemical factors that could have constituted the necessary infrastructure for the emergence of life, and thus emphasizes the
continuous nature of the process. At the same time, researchers suggest theoretical
models to account for the emergence of the new, unique features characteristic of
­biological organization, already displayed by the first organized systems.
 Not in public, however,  Darwin did contemplate the possibility of a primordial material organization out of
simple chemical compounds in a “warm little pond” under the influence of various energy sources, to form
a living entity. See F. Darwin. The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, 3 vols. (New York: Johnson Reprint
Corporation, 1969), pp. 3, 18 (originally published London: Murray, 1887).

Philosophical aspects of the origin-of-life problem

63

Although there is as yet no consensus on the possible mechanisms of the
e­ mergence of life, and though this process has not yet been simulated in the laboratory, scientists are confident that a primitive living system emerged on Earth a few
billion years ago by natural means. This conviction is based on the achievements of
the natural sciences. Above all it reflects the robust status of  the theory of evolution
that underlies the evolutionary worldview. Like any scientific conviction, it stems
from the interaction among the empirical, theoretical, and philosophical aspects of
science, being shaped by the social, political, and cultural context.4 This conviction
also serves as a motivation to the continuation of research.
The following discussion will examine two main themes that are closely interwoven. First, the principles by which theories of the origin of life face the challenge
of accounting for the emergence of biological organization will be considered. Here,
the role played by physical and chemical constraints on the primordial Earth and
the crucial function of  natural selection in the process will be analyzed. Second, the
investigation of the origin-of-life problem is presented as a case study of the nature
of science. Here, the need to acknowledge the interaction between the empirical
and the philosophical in the working of science and the assault on the evolutionary
worldview by the Intelligent-Design movement will be discussed.

4.2  The  arch and the scaffolding
As noted above, the core problem of the origin of life is the emergence of the unique
functional organization of the living system – the interdependence among its various components and their dependence on the system as a whole. Echoing other
scientists and philosophers, the Scottish chemist Graham Cairns-Smith referred to
life as appearing to have been designed [5] (p. 2). Not surprisingly, natural theology
traditionally regarded this appearance as the strongest evidence of God’s purposeful design of nature [6]. Present-day  creationists claim that signs of “intelligent
design” revealed at the molecular level are even more pronounced than ever [7].
Scientists, particularly evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, rely on material evolutionary processes, especially on the mechanism of  natural selection, to
explain the apparent design of biological organization. It is commonly accepted
by science that the last common ancestor at the root of the evolutionary tree was
already an evolved cell, containing the basic biochemical machinery and manifesting apparent design [8]. It was on the basis of these features that it could continue
to evolve by natural selection, consequently giving rise throughout the history of
the Earth to enormously diverse and adaptive forms of life.
While evolutionary biology deals with the evolution of the last common ancestor
onward, the focus of origin-of-life research is on the natural, gradual processes that
  Due to space limits and the nature of my argument, these influential factors will not be discussed here.

led to the emergence of the last common ancestor out of a lifeless environment. To
illuminate both the problem involved in the emergence of biological organization
and its naturalistic solution, Cairns-Smith introduced a highly suggestive image
representing the closely integrated biological organization – an arch of stones in
which each stone is held in place by its neighbors (see Figure 4.1). An arch could
not arise gradually, one stone at a time, hanging in midair [5]. Similarly, how could
a step-by-step evolution lead to a system in which everything depends on everything else [5] (p. 39)?5 The arch-like architecture of the cell is manifested in numerous cyclic, interlocked subsystems, crucial to the functioning of the organism. The
most noticeable subsystem is the interdependent relationship between nucleic acids
and proteins, giving rise to the chicken–egg problem: how could nucleic acids have
emerged without  proteins or proteins without nucleic acids?
Cairns-Smith pointed out that the answer to the puzzle, the gradual building
of the “paradoxical structure” of the arch, is possible by the construction of supporting scaffolding: building a stone wall gradually and then removing the stones
to leave the arch standing (see Figure 4.2) [5] (pp. 59–61). For Cairns-Smith, the
idea of a scaffold was more than a figurative device offering a naturalistic alternative to the design notion. In his scenario for the emergence of life he suggested

One of the proponents of the Intelligent Design movement, the biochemist Michael Behe, referred to this question as “the problem of irreducible complexity.” Behe contended that “An irreducibly complex system cannot
be produced … by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor system … that
is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional” (M. J. Behe. Darwin’s Black Box (New York: Free Press,
1996), p. 39). We’ll come back to this claim later.

that organisms based on organic chemistry developed at a later evolutionary stage
on pre-existing clay scaffolding. The first “organisms” capable of undergoing replication, mutation, and evolution through natural selection were made of mineral
crystals of various clays [5] (pp. 98–106). Inorganic scaffolding made of materials
ubiquitous on the primordial Earth was simple enough to evolve gradually and
could have given rise to a more complex organic chemistry. At a certain historical
point, when organic compounds were already built on the scaffolding and interconnected to form organic arch-like systems, there occurred a “genetic takeover” and
the mineral scaffolding was then discarded [5] (pp. 107–113).
It should be clarified that the purposeful (teleological) language that is used
to describe Cairns-Smith’s arch-and-scaffolding scenario is a kind of a shorthand
substitute for more elaborate causal statements describing mechanistic, selective
processes. Just as evolution through  natural selection accounts for the apparent
design of organisms, no purpose or plan is supposed to have been involved in the
construction of the scaffolding and the arch at the origin-of-life stage.6
Cairns-Smith’s suggestion of removable mineral scaffolding was his answer
to what he saw as the limitation of prebiotic chemistry to produce sophisticated
biologically relevant organic compounds without such a device [5] (pp. 4–6). The
chemical discontinuity involved in this scenario has been questioned by several
critics claiming that it challenges a basic “continuity conception” that is guiding
research into the origin and evolution of life [9, 10]. Researchers point to the
existence in present organisms of “molecular fossils” – structures or functions
that arose early in the history of life. Being highly beneficial, they were “frozen
in time,” since any change would have entailed many additional changes and the
risk of the demise of such systems [11]. For this reason many scientists believe
that the primordial organization of life was similar to the present biochemical
system. Most origin-of-life theories therefore postulate various prebiotic stages,
gradually increasing in organization and complexity that were at least partly
incorporated into the first living systems rather than discarded.  Christian de
Duve suggests that “protometabolism,” the complex set of chemical reactions
in which organic building blocks were engaged prior to the emergence of  RNA,
had to be “congruent” with metabolism into which it grew. The two had to follow
similar pathways [12].
Despite this basic difference between Cairns-Smith’s and other theories, I suggest that the arch-and-scaffolding model can serve as a common, unifying theme of
all origin-of-life theories. First, all theories grapple with the fundamental problem
of the construction of a living arch – a system, separated from its environment, in
 At the same time, the teleological terminology inherent in biological discussions is not fortuitous. It reflects
the fact that organisms are being naturally selected based on criteria of functionality and adaptability.

which both replication based on nucleic acids and  metabolism operated by protein
enzymes were interconnected. The figure of the “arch” seems to demand, even
point to, the role of a “scaffold.” Second, the concept of the scaffolding should
direct our attention to the role of physical and chemical selection mechanisms and
other channeling factors active in the prebiotic environment that laid the ground for
the working of natural selection. As will be pointed out, with the recent emphasis in
origin-of-life research on specific locales on the primordial Earth where life could
have emerged, the image of scaffolding acquires a most tangible, physical meaning. It stresses the continuity between the primordial environment and emerging
life.7 Third, philosophically, the application of this image will allow us to combat
the  creationist contention that life is based on “irreducible complex systems” the
emergence of which cannot be accounted for by causal, natural processes. Lastly,
the arch-and-scaffolding tool enables comparative analysis of the various scenarios
and theories formulated in the field, noting both their common denominator and
the different “stone walls” suggested by each [13]  (pp. 185–193).

4.3  On the role of  selection mechanisms
in the emergence of life
Biologists and philosophers of biology are engaged in an ongoing controversy on
the adequate  definition of life (and in a debate whether an exhaustive definition is
at all possible) [9 (pp. 4–9), 14, 15]. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that any
definition of life must refer to the evolution of life’s adaptive complexity through
the mechanism of natural selection [13 (pp. 238–242), 16]. Indeed, origin-of-life
researchers, despite the differences among their theories, aim at explaining the
emergence of systems capable of undergoing biological evolution.
An examination of the various scaffolds suggested with this purpose in mind
reveals that natural selection functions in all of them as an essential agent. Are we
not involved here in a vicious circle? How could natural selection have operated
prior to the existence of living systems capable of reproducing, mutating, and competing for resources? The first experiments demonstrating in vitro  Darwinian evolution in the laboratory were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. These experiments
revealed that populations of molecules capable of replicating, mutating, and reproducing these mutations responded to applied selective pressures by evolving and
adapting to new “environmental conditions” [17, 18]. It became clear that any group
of entities, not only living systems, could evolve through natural selection provided
it conformed to a set of specific conditions: reproduction, variation, inheritance

of these variations, relative advantage conferred by some of these variations, and
competition [5] (pp. 2–3). This awareness made it possible to explore the role of
natural selection in the origin of life itself. Though it was clear that molecular evolution achieved in the first in vitro experiments depended on the participation of a
highly complex replicating enzyme, these results nevertheless led to a search for
primitive entities that could have emerged on the primordial Earth and could have
fulfilled the required conditions.

4.3.1  The metabolic and genetic traditions
As one reviews the origin-of-life field, it is possible to classify theories according to various criteria.8 Historically, the investigation of the origin of life was
established early in the twentieth century both by biochemists and geneticists who
brought to the subject their particular preconceptions, methods, and terminologies [19].9 Not surprisingly, the biochemical and genetic research traditions also
involved different conceptions of the defining traits of life. While the biochemical tradition, from its inception to the present, characterizes life, primarily, as an
integrated multi-molecular entity sustaining its homeostasis through metabolic
processes, the genetic tradition focuses on the nature of life as a replicating system [20]. Chemically, the “metabolists” emphasized the emergence and function
of proteins, while the “geneticists” regarded a self-replicating genetic molecule as
the sine qua non of the emergence of life. More recently, the “chemical division”
is less definitive;10 however, the difference in emphasis is still between an early or
late appearance of genetic material (“gene-first” and “gene-second” theories) [13]
(pp. 135–178).
Clearly, these two traditions, or “camps,” attack the chicken–egg problem from
different directions, facing the challenge of accounting for the emergence and evolution of the “living arch” by different means. In order to examine the role allotted
by each group to natural selection and to the means that enable its operation, a brief
analysis of metabolic and genetic scaffolding is in order.

 These traditions were initially personified by the figures of the Russian biochemist Alexander Oparin and
the British geneticist J. B. S. Haldane. The American physicist Leonard Troland and the American geneticist
Herman Muller were also important contributors to the genetic tradition in the first decades of the twentieth
century (I. Fry. The origins of research into the origins of life. Endeavour, 3 (2006), 24–29).

4.3.2  Genetic scaffolding
The most important genetic conception addressing the chicken–egg problem is
the  RNA-world theory. Suggested in the late 1960s as a tentative idea it acquired
empirical support with the discovery of naturally occurring ribozymes in the 1980s
and the continuous isolation of additional ribozymes in molecular-evolution experiments [13] (pp. 136–142). This theory constitutes the basic genetic scaffolding
concept. The strong appeal of any “gene-first” theory stems from the fact that evolution through natural selection is best and most easily explained by the mechanism in extant cells of replication of nucleic acids, or nucleic-acid-like molecules.
The discovery that RNA molecules can function as both information carriers and
enzymes strengthens this appeal. It is thus clear that  natural selection is the central element in genetic scaffolding. However, extensive work in prebiotic chemistry
has revealed huge difficulties interfering with the synthesis of RNA and its constituents under primordial conditions [21]. The realization that even more primitive
scaffolding was needed for the emergence of a self-replicating RNA system led
to the search for simpler genetic systems [22, 23]. It also directed the attention of
origin-of-life “geneticists” to the necessary physical and chemical prebiotic factors
without which natural selection could not have operated.
This is a distinct shift from early “genetic” studies that paid little attention to
the constraining effects of prebiotic chemistry on the emergence of RNA and  selfreplication [18, 24]. A common element now in all versions of genetic scaffolding
is the extensive role of catalysts – metal ions, mineral surfaces, and peptides – both
in the synthesis of building blocks and polymers as well as in the various templatedirected reactions [25, 26]. Catalysis acts as a channeling factor, enhancing a limited number of reactions from the wide spectrum of theoretically possible ones and
enabling the synthesis of polymers of a more specific structure. Some researchers
experiment with alternative replication mechanisms that are less demanding chemically than those active in current cells and thus more in line with the “strictures
of prebiotic chemistry” [27]. They also consider how mixed populations of RNA
sequences, varying in physical and chemical properties, could have evolved. Out
of these heterogeneous aggregates of polymers, more homogeneous and efficient
sequences may have been selected, eventually giving rise to ribozymes and the
RNA world.11 Understanding the narrow constraints imposed on emerging life by
the prebiotic environment has also led to a more open attitude toward non-genetic
 The selection of RNA sequences, homogeneous in terms of their constitution and chirality, from a mixed
­population depended on differences in stability and in the efficiency of binding. It was thus chemical selection
that made it possible, first through the mechanism of template-directed ligation, and later through the templatedirected-elongation mechanism, for natural selection to become active, see A. Kanavarioti. Template-directed
chemistry and the origins of the RNA world. Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere, 24 (1994),
489–492; K.D. James and A.D. Ellington. A search for missing links between self-replicating nucleic acids
and the RNA world. Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere, 25 (1995), 528.

models. Leading researchers of the chemistry of  RNA consider the possible role of
metabolic, non-genetic systems in changing the chemical environment and thereby
influencing the chances of the emergence of a genetic system [28, 29].

4.3.3  Metabolic scaffolding
Early genetic studies regarded the synthesis of a few self-replicating sequences as
enough to start the emergence of life through the action of natural selection. They
tended to disregard the role played by the prebiotic environment in building the
infrastructure needed for natural selection to work. Early metabolic theories, on the
contrary, focused on the channeling effects of the prebiotic environment leading to
the establishment of peptide catalysts and metabolic cycles and were not very concerned with the mechanism of evolution and the role of natural selection [30, 31].
Most metabolic theories, old and new, in focusing on the integrated ­organization of
the living system as its characteristic trait, postulate the emergence of a protocellular unit separated from its environment as an early, crucial step in scaffolding
construction. The postulated protocells are claimed to have emerged as a result of
physical and chemical prebiotic processes, especially physical and chemical selection processes based on thermodynamic and kinetic criteria. Material self-organization of available prebiotic chemical compounds is a fundamental principle in all
metabolic scaffolding.12
The protocellular character of emerging metabolic entities was associated from
the start with their tendency to grow and divide. This was viewed as an unsophisticated means of heredity, assumed to form the basis of a primitive process of natural selection and evolution. In distinction to the predominant “genetic” conception
asserting that evolution through natural selection is possible only through the replication of a genetic molecule, “metabolists” claim that reproduction of protocells
at the origin of life could have been independent of replication [20] (pp. 5–9). More
recent metabolic theories attempt to provide a “metabolic” mechanism for natural
selection and evolution based on the emergence of autocatalytic reaction cycles
within the protocellular units. Unlike the autocatalysis of a single genetic polymer,
autocatalysis of a whole cycle is achieved by the mutual catalysis of its chemical
components when a certain level of chemical complexity of the system is reached
[9 (pp. 153–154), 32, 33, 34, 35]. All these models also grapple with the question of
the emergence of metabolic novelties, branching from the autocatalytic cycles that

on rare, though finite, occasions can give rise to a variant autocatalytic cycle, thus
providing a basis for selection and evolution.13
Recently, there has been a growing tendency of origin-of-life research to focus
on the question of specific geophysical and geochemical settings in which life
could have emerged. The notion that life might have emerged at the bottom of the
sea near hydrothermal vents is gaining wide support [36].14 The autotrophic metabolic theory of the organic chemist, Günter Wächtershäuser, postulates the emergence of a “surface metabolist,” consisting of a surface of the mineral pyrite (FeS2)
and bonded organic compounds, at such submarine sites. The scaffold as a system
within which processes of chemical selection based on differences in chemical
affinity and stability set the stage for the action of natural selection is prominent in
Wächtershäuser’s theory [33].15

4.4  The arch-and-scaffolding image:
the philosophical angle
We have observed how origin-of-life theories, both genetic and metabolic, suggest
various modes of scaffolding all aimed at answering the fundamental question,
how did matter organize itself to form life? These include both theoretical constructs, e.g. the RNA world, and actual physical structures, e.g. a pyrite surface or a
lipid vesicle. Extensive research and the acquisition of data in the fields of prebiotic
chemistry, geophysics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, make the notion of
scaffolding necessary and cogent. This idea of scaffolding may also shed light on
some philosophical dilemmas that traditionally accompany the discussion of the
emergence of life.
As pointed out, although the construction of scaffolding and the emergence
of an arch may appear to be a purposeful process, it can in fact be accounted
 Instead of identifying biological information with the “digital” machinery consisting of the “letters” in
­biopolymers, these theories postulate a “compositional” mode of information that can be stored in and
­propagated by mutually catalytic networks, see D. Segré, D. Ben-Eli, and D. Lancet. Compositional genomes:
prebiotic information transfer in mutually catalytic noncovalent assemblies. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, 97(8) (2000), 4112–4117.

for by material processes. Crucial to the evolutionary worldview, the natural
self-organization of prebiotic chemical building blocks to form a living system suggests an alternative to the need for a teleological divine intervention
in the process. The arch-and-scaffolding image also negates the idea that the
emergence of life was the result of an improbable chance event [10]. It is now
unimaginable to assume, as was the case at the earlier stages of origin-of-life
research, that a “happy accident,” producing a molecule capable of self-replication, was responsible for the emergence of life [37, 38, 39]. Obviously, in distinction to the biochemical events in extant cells, the chemical processes involved
in the construction of scaffolding were not directed by genetic information, and
in that sense were random [40] (p. 141). However, due to physical and chemical constraints these processes were not statistically random – not all chemical
options had the same chance to materialize, hence the development of life took
the more probable channels [39 (pp. 22–30), 40 (pp. 213–217)].
In a captivating metaphor, the Princeton biologist Harold Blum compared
evolution to a great tapestry. The basic chemical properties of the environment
constitute the strong warp into which mutation and natural selection introduce the
multicolored woof. Blum, however, indicated that through the restrictions exerted
on mutation by the physical nature of the environment, the warp influenced the
pattern itself: “Purely physical factors … must have imposed such restrictions from
the beginning of life, since that beginning was inextricably tangled up with the
physical nature of the then existing earth” [41].
Does the emphasis on physical and chemical continuity mean that the originof-life process can be described as “reductionistic”? Among the various versions
of “reductionism” contemplated by philosophers of science, the one relevant to
our discussion is “theoretical reductionism” – the claim that theoretical concepts
and explanations in biology can be reduced, in principle, to those in chemistry
[42, 43].
According to the physical chemist  Manfred Eigen, the two philosophical
options for the explanation of the emergence of genetic information (that he identifies with the emergence of life) are reduction, or the assumption of vis vitalis (vital
force) [39] (p. 122). At the same time, Eigen does claim that genetic information
represents a quality that “far transcends chemistry” (p. 124). In his discussion of
evolution, the chemist Harold Morowitz also speaks about “a deep logic of evolution within the reductionistic roots of quantum mechanics, the periodic table,
and the boundary conditions on the planet Earth” [44]. The theme of reductionism is obviously connected to the question of the “autonomy of biology,” i.e. the
relationship between biology on the one hand and physics and chemistry on the
other. Traditionally, supporters of the notion of the autonomy of biology adopted
a skeptical attitude toward the possibility of solving the origin-of-life problem

[43 (p. 584), 45].16 The scaffolding approach, embodying the emergence of life as
part of the evolutionary process, transcends the erroneously presumed dichotomy
between biology and physico-chemistry and between reductionistic and organismic attitudes to life and its emergence. By insisting on both continuity and the
emergence of more complex levels of organization, on physical and chemical factors as conditions necessary for the emergence of biological properties non-existent
before, the arch-and-scaffolding image is a synthesis of both.

4.5  The emergence of life and the nature of science
A current wave of new  creationism, in the USA, and also elsewhere, challenges the
reasoning underlying the arch-and-scaffolding image, attacking the very ­possibility
of the natural emergence and evolution of biological organization. Using molecular terminology, the new  creationists claim that “irreducible complex systems” [7]
could not have emerged and evolved via a gradual selective process. Rather, they
suggest a supernatural Intelligent Design as the only explanation of the origin of life
and important stages in evolution [7] (pp. 187–205) (see also [46]). The  Intelligent
Design (ID) proponents dismiss the role of prebiotic chemistry and the application
of natural selection to the origin of life and insist that nothing but a direct intervention by a purposeful, supernatural agent could have brought about the appearance
of life on Earth [47].
Since most scientists identify the empirical procedures of science as its most
­distinct characteristic, they believe that the conflict with the  creationists is basically empirical rather than philosophical. Biochemists and evolutionary biologists
therefore respond to the Intelligent-Design challenge by demonstrating theoretically and empirically how highly complex anatomical and biochemical systems
could have evolved naturally [48, 49, 50]. This exclusive focus on the empirical
aspects of science is especially significant when confronting the ID movement on
the origin-of-life question. Since there is still no agreed-upon scientific solution to
the problem, it is felt that ID  claims in this domain cannot be fully rejected at the
moment. Indeed, origin-of-life research is often viewed as a problem in the fight
against  creationism – as the “soft underbelly of evolutionary biology” [51].
The philosopher of biology,  Michael Ruse believes that the status of originof-life study differs from that of Darwinism.17 He thus finds it advisable, facing a

believer who asserts the special intervention by God in the creation of life, “to let
it be” [52]. The biochemist,  Christian de Duve points out that as far as science is
concerned a supernatural intervention is unnecessary, “as well as unlikely, in the
light of present knowledge.” Yet, he feels that since the science of today “cannot
prove wrong” those who believe in divine intervention, “it would be a mistake to
make this point into an issue” [53].18 Apparently, according to this view, science
could provide facts “to demonstrate an entirely material origin of life” [54]. Thus,
the problem with the scientific status of origin-of-life research is its present inability to provide such a demonstration – the problem is with the lack of “proof,” or
“evidence.”
The history of the attempts by philosophers of science to determine the essential characteristics of science and demarcate it from non-science is notoriously
controversial. A notable relevant episode took place following a legal battle with
the  creationists in the early 1980s. In his testimony in this trial,  Michael Ruse
described “ creation science” as a religion and a non-science. Ruse distinguished
“creation science” from the  theory of evolution, which he characterized as science
by its empirical methodology [55]. A heated dispute among philosophers followed
in which other philosophers of science pointed out to Ruse that some of the hypotheses of “creation science” (e.g. the young age of Earth) are empirical and testable
(which in fact made it possible to refute them ). The best way, they suggested, to
deal with the creationists is thus piecemeal, by refuting empirically each of their
contentions [56, 57] .
Interestingly, both parties to this controversy seemed to disregard the philosophical dividing line between science and  creationism. The following discussion
will aim to point out how this dividing line is associated with the question of the
nature of science. The core procedures of science – putting hypotheses to the test
and establishing empirical evidence – are based on philosophical presuppositions
that provide necessary guidelines and make possible the work of science. Crucial
to the philosophical underpinning of science is the presupposition that natural
phenomena are to be explained on the basis of natural causes obeying the laws
of nature. This presupposition, whose implications lie at the heart of the conflict
with creationism , rules out any explanation based on purposeful intervention and
is often described as “methodological naturalism.” As put by the philosopher of
science, Robert Pennock, “lawful regularity is at the very heart of the naturalistic
worldview and to say that some power is supernatural is, by definition, to say that
it can violate natural laws” [58]. Whether the naturalistic worldview also involves a

“metaphysical” or “ontological naturalism,” underlying an  agnostic or an atheistic
point of view, is a controversial issue among philosophers and scientists.19
The interaction between the empirical and philosophical aspects of science can
be fully appreciated when examined in its historical development. During the last
few hundred years, the naturalistic philosophical presupposition guiding research
and the empirical results of this research continuously fed into each other. As a
result, the more successful empirical science became, the stronger this philosophical presupposition grew. It should be clarified: philosophical ideas are not “caused”
by empirical evidence. Similarly, philosophical ideas do not “cause” new theories
in science. Nevertheless, both empirical results and philosophical concepts contribute to changes in the intellectual climate, allowing new scientific questions to
be raised and making new scientific solutions possible. This dynamic interchange,
always taking place within specific cultural and political contexts, has given rise
during the last few hundred years to the naturalistic worldview whose implications
clearly transcend questions of methodology.
The naturalistic conception, relating to the realm of physical phenomena, was
developed as part of the scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For a while, particularly until the middle of the eighteenth century, the
new Copernican cosmology promoted a revival of natural theology, especially in
England. The discoveries of science were seen as the strongest indication of the
existence and properties of God. However, by the end of the eighteenth century, the
establishment of cosmology and astronomy based on Newtonian principles replaced
the previous explanation of nature through purposeful divine intervention.
The removal of God from the direct explanation of natural phenomena and the
rejection of intention and purpose as causes in the working of nature – intertwining elements of the new cosmological worldview – came into their own following
the rise in the nineteenth century of the evolutionary conception of nature. The
revolution precipitated by Darwin’s theory of evolution depended on these previous
developments and carried them even further. When the “hand of God” as the cause
of the adaptive complexity of organisms was replaced by the material mechanisms
of evolutionary biology, the remaining stronghold of natural theology in the realm of
biology came down.
Historians differ in their interpretation of the changes that led to the decreasing
relevance of an intervening God for the explanation of natural phenomena. They
point to diverse processes – political, economical, and cultural – as crucial in the

development of a new naturalistic worldview.20 However, the major influence of the
growth of science on this development cannot be denied.
The interaction between empirical and theoretical scientific achievements and
a philosophical standpoint is evident also in the development of the study of the
origin of life. Not until the  theory of evolution proved itself strong enough theoretically and empirically could the question of the origin of life be incorporated
into the study of evolution. As already noted, in the early twentieth century, when
the mechanism of natural selection was held in much doubt, many scientists still
considered the origin of life a taboo, better left untouched [2, 59]. This attitude
changed toward the middle of the century when the “neo-Darwinian synthesis”
established  natural selection as the major evolutionary mechanism and rejected all
purposive explanations of evolution previously entertained [60]. Devising experiments that showed the power of natural selection at  the molecular level allowed
scientists to formulate various theoretical prebiotic scenarios. Data gathered by
astronomy, geology, chemistry, and biology provided stronger constraints that limited the number of possible theoretical origin scenarios.
Despite the greater knowledge and sophistication in evaluating the problem, it
is not solved yet. Researchers are still debating the mechanisms and processes that
could have brought about the emergence of the first living systems. No empirical
simulation in the laboratory of a possible hypothesis was yet achieved. Following
the above brief historical examination of the interdependence between empirical
evidence and the naturalistic worldview, the question of the scientific status of
origin-of-life study can now be reconsidered. It can be confidently stated that this
status does not stand or fall on the merit of empirical evidence alone. Despite the
difference in the empirical evidence for evolution and the origin of life, the distinction between unproven-as-yet origin of life and evolution-as-a-fact is not justified. The question whether life emerged naturally is not put to the test afresh in
every new experiment. Scientists feel confident about this question on the basis of a
robust worldview drawing its strength from the historical record of science.
Indeed, science is not a body of demonstrated truths and scientific activity does
rely on belief where we cannot provide proof [61].  Naturalism as a system of beliefs
is clearly of a different status than empirical data and like all philosophical claims
cannot be confirmed or refuted by facts. There are no facts to “demonstrate an
entirely material origin of life [54]”, nor facts to refute it. Scientific belief, however,
is not detached from empirical facts and can be strengthened or weakened by the
accumulation of observations and experiments. In this respect, the confidence of
origin-of-life scientists in the eventual solution of the problem is different from a
dogmatic belief.

It is on this crucial interaction between the empirical and philosophical aspects
of science that ID promoters focus their attack. Phillip Johnson, the leader and
initiator of the ID movement, argues that instead of practicing “empirical science,” which should avoid “all philosophical prejudice and follow the evidence
wherever it leads,” evolutionary biologists in fact practice science “as applied
materialist philosophy” [62]. In the same vein, the study of the origin of life is
presented as “metaphysical,” failing to be based on empirical evidence [62] (see
also [63], p. 197).
In their struggle against science, ID promoters contend that unlike the study of
evolution, their own “science” is based on “experience” [63] (p. 177). Realizing
obviously that there can be no experience of a supernatural designer, ID theorists move instead to discuss human designers, basing their argument on the analogy between human and divine intelligence. However, this is a faulty analogy: the
causal connection between human designers and their organized, functional products can be explored, tested, and verified. On the other hand, a supernatural intelligent agent and his “design activity” cannot undergo the same scrutiny. Instead of
distinguishing between natural and supernatural causes, the new  creationists differentiate between “natural” and “intelligent” causes. Relying on a general, generic
sense of the term “cause,” they move freely between intelligent human causation
open to observation and experimentation and the alleged analogical supernatural
intelligent causation [13] (pp. 204–206).
Presenting ID ideas as “scientific” is thus based on changing the concept of science altogether. In order to allow their “science” to detect the “footprints” (“specified complexity,” “irreducible complexity,” etc.) of a purposeful agent, ID theorists
have to insist that intention and supernatural agents should be part and parcel of
science (see [64] (especially pp. 197–201) and [65]).
Interestingly, some scientists and philosophers, ignoring the philosophical
dimension of science, seem also to disregard the philosophical implications of the
new  creationism for the nature of science. In a recent volume titled Why Intelligent
Design Fails, one of the editors contends that “ID is a very ambitious claim and … it
must produce strong evidence before scientists go along with the proposed revolution” [66].21 Urging ID promoters to “go scientific” by producing testable hypotheses and, eventually, tested evidence is a contradiction in terms: no observation or
experiment, no empirical measure whatsoever, can test supernatural intention and
purpose supposedly intervening in nature and affecting natural phenomena.22 The
 Similarly, the philosopher, Niall Shanks in a critical review of one of Johnson’s books says that scientists
do not currently support ID claims for a supernatural creation, “but that is because these are hypotheses for
which there is not currently any high-quality evidence” (N. Shanks. Creationism, evolution and baloney.

supporters of science should realize that the conflict between science and ID is
not one between experimental evidence and the lack of it. The conflict is between
those who are capable of studying nature and indeed do so and those who cannot
and hence do not.
To recapitulate, the study of the origin of life is an instructive case study of the
nature of science: the very fact that researchers still struggle to find a ­specific scenario that could have led to the emergence of life, while not doubting the in-principle
natural character of such a scenario, reveals the complex interaction characterizing
science between empirical evidence, theory, and the naturalistic worldview .

The  origin of terrestrial life:
a Christian perspective

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Ernan McMullin

When the “origin-of-life” issue is debated nowadays, the question most often asked
is: How did the first cell originate? What sequence of processes could have given
rise to the extraordinary complexity of even the most rudimentary living cell?
Once such a cell was in place, the assumption is that  metabolism and descent with
modification could begin and the Darwinian selection process could get under way,
generating over the course of aeons the vast profusion of  natural kinds, living and
extinct, that we know. But what sort of selection principles, working on what sort
of materials, could have sufficed in the first place to build up the kind of intricate
structure that even the smallest functioning cell requires? In short, how did the living come from the non-living in the first place?
In earlier centuries, the transition from non-life to life would have seemed
unproblematic, indeed entirely commonplace. It would have appeared obvious that
living comes from non-living in the world of nature all the time: maggots develop
in decaying flesh, tiny worms appear in rotting fruit, and so on. At the lowest levels
of living complexity, matter (it seemed) could generate life unaided. Only with
the advent of the microscope and finally the experiments of  Pasteur was it shown
that this kind of spontaneous generation was only apparent: no real transition from
non-living to living actually occurred in it. So how did life begin? With the discovery in recent decades of just how biochemically complex the cell is, the transition
has become even more of a puzzle. As other essays in this collection will show,
important advances have been made and hints of possible paths have appeared. But
it would seem fair to say that an even moderately plausible reconstruction in scientific terms of how the first functioning cells came to be is still lacking.
5.1  A Christian perspective?
One recent response to this situation goes under the title of “Intelligent Design”  (ID).

The origin of terrestrial life: a Christian perspective

81

it postulates the “special” action on the part of a creating intelligence as the
most plausible, some would argue the only plausible, explanation of how the first
cells were formed. More broadly, it points to various features of organisms that
would likewise, at a later evolutionary stage, have required the distinctive action
of a ­shaping intelligence to bring their first appearance about. The “irreducible
­complexity” of such features as the mammalian blood-clotting mechanism, so it is
argued, would exclude a gradualist account of their first coming-to-be [1]. Unlike
the “creation-science” of an earlier generation of  Christian critics of Darwin, the
proponents of ID tend to limit themselves to what they regard as the key transitions in the evolutionary story, among which the origin of the first terrestrial living
things holds pride of place.
The ID argument can take two rather different logical forms, as already implied.
One, which might be called “strong” ID, maintains that these transitions cannot, as a
matter of principle, be explained in the gradualist terms of neo-Darwinism or of conventional natural science generally. The other, “weak” ID, emphasizes the current
lack of satisfactory accounts in evolutionary terms of how those transitions occurred
and concludes that an explanation in terms of a Designer’s action outside the ordinary course of Nature is, at present, at least, clearly the preferable explanation, notably for those who already accept the existence of a Creator on other grounds. (For
others, the epistemic situation would, of course, be different, though proponents of
the weaker form of ID argument would argue that it gives a motive for belief in such
a Creator, the strength of which would depend on how far from satisfactory formulation the current scientific attempts to explain the designated transitions are.)
The title of this chapter, “The origin of terrestrial life: a Christian perspective,”
might lead the reader to expect that the ID position, whether in its stronger or
weaker form, would be the likely choice for such a perspective. Strong ID is, however, open to obvious challenge: it would require one to know somehow or other
in advance what the limits are of the intrinsic transformative capacities of matter.
Claims that conventional science can never, in principle, explain the first appearance of some feature of the living world, including that of life itself, seem presumptuous in the light of the achievements of the sciences of recent centuries. If, on the
other hand, the argument were to depend primarily on the fact that scientists have
encountered far more checks than anticipated in their search for a “natural” origin
of life and at the moment might be thought to be at a loss (weak ID), an obvious
response would be that the resources of the scientific imagination, backed with
careful experimental trial, are far from exhausted and pointers are beginning to
appear. After all, only half a century has elapsed since serious research on this
issue first got under way.
I will, however, leave aside any further assessment of the merits and demerits of
the ID approach; that has been amply done elsewhere. I prefer to focus here in quite

another direction, leaving it to the reader to judge whether or not it offers a more
plausible expectation, from the Christian point of view, of the sort of explanation
that should, even in advance, be expected of how life made its first appearance on
Earth. What gives this alternative a special plausibility for the Christian is that it
is rooted in the earliest ages of Christian theology, long before Darwin was heard
of. It cannot, then, be dismissed as a merely defensive ploy to cover the retreat of
Christian belief in the face of triumphant scientific advance. Though its relevance
for our purposes is to the origin of terrestrial life, its broader relevance is to the
evolutionary account generally.

5.2  Two sources
The theologians of the early Christian church relied on two major sources as they
pondered the question of cosmic origins. The first of those was, of course, Genesis,
the book that serves as solemn introduction to the Bible. But there was an ­immediate
problem. The first two chapters of Genesis set forth two rather different accounts
of origins. The first chapter describes the creation as spread out over six days. First
come the heavens and the Earth, then in succession the creation of light, of the firmament dividing the waters above from those beneath, of vegetation and trees, of
the Sun and Moon, of fish and birds, of land animals, and finally of the first human
beings, male and female (Genesis 1 to 2:4). The second account tells the story
rather differently: the Earth is already in place, but barren and empty. After a flood
rises from the Earth and waters it, God fashions a man from the dust of the Earth
and plants a garden containing every sort of tree; then God adds ­animals and birds,
drawing them “from the earth,” and finally makes a woman to be man’s helpmate
(Genesis 2:5 to 2:25).
The sequence of events does not appear to be the same in the two accounts nor is
the focus the same. The first emphasizes God as the author of all that is; the second
concerns itself with the creation of man and woman and with their relation to the
rest of creation. Since Genesis was assumed to have had Moses as single author,
attentive readers would ask themselves: What could Moses have had in mind by
telling the story of creation in two installments so different from one another? The
first chapters of Genesis were the source of choice for Christian theologians of the
early and the medieval church who concerned themselves with the elucidation of
cosmic origins. And this would leave them with a question: How are the first chapters of Genesis to be made consistent with one another?
The second resource to which these theologians could turn was the works of the
 philosophers, Greek and Roman, the secular learning of that day. In this case, the
appropriation was cautious and usually only implicit. These were, after all, pagan
sources as far as the theologians were concerned; the philosophers lacked the sort

of privileged access to truth claimed for the Bible. Nevertheless, they had to be
reckoned with and might be availed of when they could help to illuminate some
theological issue or, as in this case, a puzzling biblical text.
Only three of the earlier philosophical cosmogonies seemed to have the potential
to be of service to the theologians. The first was that of  Plato, the most influential of
the earlier Greek philosophers in those formative years of Christian theology. His
Timaeus had been expressly conceived as a  cosmogony, mythic in form but intended
as a “likely story.” Plato begins from the evidences of the work of intelligence that
he sees everywhere in the physical world. How are they to be accounted for? One
way, the one to which he devotes most attention, is to postulate a “Demiourgos” or
Craftsman, a God who through Reason brought order from an original disorder of
matter in chaotic motion, a matter not itself of the Demiurge’s making. Matter, the
realm of necessity, is resistant; the order imposed by Reason is never perfect, never
permanent. In this  cosmogony, there is a Maker and a beginning.
Very different was the Stoic tradition, which was destined to take a firm hold in
the Roman world of the first two centuries of the Christian era. For the Stoic, physics and ethics were inseparable: the order discovered in the one becomes the ideal
to be achieved in the other. God is the power that makes all things be what they
are and holds them together in harmony. God and the universe are one: all change
is immanent in God and ordered by God’s logos spermatikos (seedlike word). The
operation of this logos is sometimes described as a creative fire, sometimes as a
tension, depending on whether its capacity to make things new or its capacity to
maintain order is in question. The eclectic  cosmogony of Plotinus, which gained in
popularity in the Roman world as Stoicism declined, drew on a variety of sources,
on Platonism mainly but also on other  Greek philosophies as well as on Oriental
religious thought. Plotinus represents creation as an emanation from the One. The
One first gives rise to Nous (Intellect) from which in turn comes Soul. Then Soul
continues this downward process of emanation, making use of the productive power
of the ideas present within it to form “seedlike principles” (logoi spermatikoi in
the original Greek, rationes seminales in Latin translation). Somewhat after the
fashion of Aristotle’s substantial forms, these combine with matter, the indeterminate, to form the familiar bodies of the sensible world. They are, as it were, the last
flicker of the One, removed as they are from the source of good and intelligibility
from which the timeless process of emanation begins.
In the monistic system of Stoicism, there is no qualitative difference between
God and the universe: the logos spermatikos is, effectively, God. And the physical
universe is the embodiment of the order produced by that logos, the model indeed
for the sort of order to which the ethical life should aspire. Whereas for the neoPlatonism of Plotinus, the One and matter, the indeterminate, are as far removed
from one another as conceivable: indeed, it is unclear how matter, so understood,

can have a place in a fully emanationist system. Here the logoi spermatikoi are
plural and the world they inform is touched with evil by the mere fact of being in
part material.
When the theologians of that day looked for aid in understanding the sometimes
obscure or laconic text of the Scriptures when it touched on matters that were also
of broader philosophic concern, it was to resources such as these that they turned,
just as their modern counterparts often draw on the philosophies and sciences
of our own time. Preeminent among those theologians was  Augustine, bishop of
Hippo in North Africa, whose work was to have such a profound influence on the
Christian theology of later ages.

5.3   Augustine on creation
As a young man, Augustine was attracted to the teachings of Mani, then widely disseminated in the Mediterranean world. Born in Babylon around AD 216, Mani created an eclectic religion with elements drawn from practically every religious source
of the day: from Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity. His teaching
featured an uncompromising dualism between polar opposites, portrayed as warfare
between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. The dramatic  cosmogony he proposed
described a primal struggle between two forces that existed independently of one
another. So strongly dualist a cosmogony posed a challenge for the cosmogony  of
Genesis, with its single all-powerful Creator of all that is and its repetition of “and
God saw that it was good” at each stage of the creation. The Manicheans, not surprisingly, subjected to unsparing attack the six-day account of the creation, so different from their own version of cosmic origins, treating it as childish and incoherent,
unable to account for the pervasive presence of evil in the world.
When Augustine returned to the Christian faith, he set his impressive talents to
the task of developing and deepening the theological doctrines that were coming
to define the still-new Christian church [2] (pp. 11–16). It was not surprising that
meeting the Manichean challenge to Genesis would rank high in his priorities.
Two early commentaries on Genesis, the second unfinished, left him dissatisfied.
Finally, in AD 401, he began the composition of what would become one of his
major works, the De Genesi ad litteram, which would eventually run to twelve
books and would occupy him on and off for fourteen years.
The work was intended to be a “literal” commentary, not in the modern sense of
that term – it frequently treats as “literal” what we today would describe as metaphor – but, rather, in contrast to “allegorical” (i.e. regarding the Old Testament text
as foreshadowing later Christian themes). “Literal” for Augustine in practice meant
something like: “in the primary sense intended by the author.” A decision that he
had to make right away was how to reconcile the striking differences between the

two accounts of creation in Genesis 1 and 2. His solution would seem, to the ­modern
reader at least, quite a radical one. He was evidently deploying the resources of the
Stoic and neo-Platonic philosophies of the day to arrive at a more coherent, if
unexpected, reading of the six-day account in chapter 1, one that departed almost
entirely from the literal in our sense of that term but one that (more or less) enabled
the two chapters to constitute a single story.
He proposes first that the “days” of which the first account of the creation speaks
cannot be understood in the everyday sense of that term “day” here:

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

It is not to be taken in the sense of our day, which we reckon by the course of the sun; but
it must have another meaning, applicable to the three days mentioned before the creation
of the heavenly bodies. This special meaning of “day” must not be maintained just for the
first three days, with the understanding that after the third day [i.e. when the Sun makes its
first appearance] we take the word “day” in its ordinary sense. But we must keep the same
meaning even to the sixth and seventh days [3] (par. 43).

The creation was not, from the human perspective, a series of discrete acts on
God’s part spread out over six days or even six indefinitely long periods of time.
Augustine lays much weight on a single text here: “He made all things together”
(Sirach 18:1).1 The “days” of creation reduce to the single moment of cosmic initiation when all the  natural kinds are already somehow prefigured. The six-fold
distinction in Genesis 1 must, then, refer to something other than time. He could
only speculate as to what this might be.2 This idea of a creation in which “all
things” are somehow already present from the beginning owed something to neoPlatonism for its philosophic inspiration. It had already been broached by Basil and
by  Gregory of Nyssa, a Greek theologian of the Alexandrine school. Here is how
Gregory puts it:
The sources, causes, and potencies of all things were collectively sent forth in an instant,
and in this first impulse of the Divine Will, the essences of all things assembled together:
heaven, aether, star, fire, air, sea, earth, animal, plant – all beheld by the eye of God. …  There
followed a certain necessary series according to a certain order … as nature, the maker,
required … appearing not by chance … but because the necessary arrangement of nature
required succession in the things coming into being [4].

Augustine developed this notion much further than his predecessors had done. From
God’s timeless perspective, he maintained, there is but a single act of creation: “one
 Ironically, the crucial “together” (“simul”) in this passage now appears to have been a mistranslation of the
original Hebrew in the Old Latin translation Augustine was using.
2
 He suggests that it could be two successive stages in the angelic knowledge of the “ordered arrangement
according to causal connection” [3], LMG, Book IV, par. 33) implicit in the creation of the material universe,
but he emphasizes how tentative that suggestion must remain.

can speak of ‘before’ and ‘after’ in the relationship of creatures, although all is
simultaneous in the creative act of God” [3] (par. 56). But from our perspective,
the perspective of the timebound creature, God’s creative act has two “moments,”
two phases:
one in the original creation when God made all creatures before resting from all His works
on the seventh day, and the other in the administration of creatures by which He works
even now. In the first instance God made all things together without any moments of time
intervening, but now He works within the course of time, by which we see the stars move
from their rising to their setting … [5] (par. 27).

He stresses the distinctness of the two phases from our point of view:
We should not think of [the first creation of things] as if it were the same as His working
now in time. Rather, He made that which gave time its beginning as He made all things
together, disposing them in an order based not on intervals of time but on causal connections … [5] (par. 12).

Copyright   2009. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Later theologians would mark the distinction by means of different names,
­“creation” and “conservation,” even though, to repeat, both are understood as
aspects of the single creative act from the Creator’s perspective. (The unavoidable duality of perspective is a major source of ambiguity in all this.) Augustine  is
careful to stress that the Creator’s involvement does not end with the originating
bringing-to-be: “For the power and might of the Creator … makes every creature
abide; and if this power ever ceased to govern creatures, their essences would pass
away and all nature would perish” [3] (par. 22).
5.4   Augustine’s seedlike principles
But now, in what sense can one say that all things were created simultaneously
in the first moment of the universe’s existence? Recall that this is what Augustine
requires in order to have an instantaneous act cover all the multiple contents of
the universe described in Genesis 1. It is at this point that he makes his most distinctive contribution, appropriating from the  Stoics and neo-Platonists the notion
of seedlike principles (rationes seminales).3 But these principles function rather
differently for him than did those of his predecessors. The Creator, he proposes,
implanted in the matter or “earth” that came to be in the first moment of creation,
the seedlike principles of each kind that would later make its appearance, each in
its own time, when the conditions would be favorable.
 It is difficult to find an adequate translation here for “ratio” or “logos.” Since the rationes are realized in the
primal matter somewhat after the fashion of Aristotelian forms, the literal translation, “reason,” seems hardly
appropriate. The term “principle” adopted here is intended to convey the notion of a really existing causal
factor.

e are chemical beings. Every living organism, from the simplest
microbes to multicellular fungi, plants, and animals, incorporates thousands of intricate molecular components. All of nature’s diverse life-forms grow, develop, reproduce, and respond to changes in
their external environment—vital tasks that must be accomplished by
exquisitely balanced cascades of chemical reactions.
The more biologists learn about life, even the most “primitive”
single-celled organisms, the more amazingly complex life seems to be.
Everywhere you look, living entities have found their niche, and they
survive in wonderfully varied ways. Indeed, in a sense, chemical complexity seems synonymous with life. Yet emergent systems, however
complex, are usually built from relatively simple parts, and life is no
exception.
One of the transforming discoveries of biology is that all known
life-forms rely on only a few basic types of chemical reactions, and
these reactions produce a mere handful of molecular building blocks.
Virtually all of life’s essential construction materials are carbon-based
organic molecules that combine by the thousands to form layered enclosures or chainlike polymers. In every instance, just a few kinds of
small molecules assemble into a great variety of larger structures.
In the early nineteenth century, conventional wisdom held that
life’s chemical compounds formed by their own mysterious rules, perhaps governed by a “vital force.” Many scholars assumed that the na133

scent science of chemistry applied only to the inorganic world—the
world of rocks, minerals, and metals. This perception changed in 1828,
when the young German chemist, mineral collector, and gynecologist
Friedrich Wöhler demonstrated that biological molecules are no different in principle from other chemicals. He combined the common
laboratory reagent cyanic acid with ammonia and succeeded in producing urea, which is extracted in the kidneys and found in urine.
Wöhler’s letter announcing his important discovery displayed a sense
of whimsy not always associated with German academicians: “I can no
longer, as it were, hold back my chemical urine: and I have to let out
that I can make urea without needing a kidney, whether of man or
dog.” By employing straightforward lab techniques to produce a chemical substance known only from life, Wöhler convinced his colleagues
of the ordinariness of organic chemistry.

MODULAR LIVING
Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the molecules of living
organisms is their modular design. This familiar strategy is similar to
that of modern architects, who rely for the most part on standard
building materials. They use mass-produced bricks, beams, windows,
doors, stairs, lighting fixtures, and so on to assemble an almost infinite
variety of commercial and private buildings.
You don’t have to build in that way. A multimillionaire acquaintance recently created the most extraordinary mansion, with every
square foot of walls and floor, every light and bath fixture, every door
and window custom-designed and hand-crafted. It’s an amazing house,
with secret passages, unexpected nooks, and hidden closets, all lovingly constructed of the finest woods, stone, and other extravagant
materials. Such personalized craftsmanship is wonderful to see, but
inordinately expensive. Most of us choose a more economical path. By
relying on a few standard construction modules, buildings are faster
and cheaper to design and build. But modularity doesn’t imply uniformity. You can design a unique dwelling of almost any size or shape
from simple components available through any hardware or building
supply store.
The same modular principle holds for life’s carbon-based molecular building blocks. Four key types of molecules—sugars, amino acids,
nucleic acids, and hydrocarbons—exemplify life’s chemical parsimony.

THE MACROMOLECULES OF LIFE

135

Sugars are the basic building blocks of carbohydrates, Earth’s most
abundant biomolecules. Many common sugars in our diets, including
the fructose of honey, the sucrose of cane sugar, and the glucose of
fruits, are small molecules consisting of at most a few dozen atoms.
These energy-rich molecules incorporate carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen typically in about a 1:1:2 ratio. But most of life’s sugar molecules
are locked into macromolecules—countless individual sugar molecules
linked together to form giant polymers, such as the fibrous cellulose of
plant stems or the bulky starch of potatoes.
Amino acids are small molecules that link together to form proteins. Proteins serve as the chemical workhorses of life, with myriad
vital functions: They form tissues and strengthen bone; they act as hormones to control glandular functions; they clot blood, digest food, and
promote the thousands of chemical operations essential to life. All proteins form from long chains of hundreds to thousands of individual
amino acid molecules, lined up like beads on a string. These chains
fold into the most wonderful shapes, each protein folded in such a way
as to accomplish a specific chemical task.
The vital genetic molecules DNA and RNA are also lengthy
chainlike polymers, assembled from small molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide, in turn, is constructed from three small molecular parts: a 5-carbon sugar (ribose in RNA, its cousin deoxyribose
in DNA); a base (one of five closely related ring-shaped molecules);
and a phosphate group (a tiny cluster made up of a phosphorus atom
surrounded by four oxygen atoms). RNA consists of a long chain of
single nucleotides, while in DNA two such chains link together and
twist into the famed “double helix” structure.
Finally (as we’ll see in the next chapter), arrays of elongated hydrocarbon molecules called lipids, including a wide variety of fats and
oils, coalesce in every cell to form membranes, store energy, and perform other critical functions.
The most enticing aspect of Stanley Miller’s experiment and the
discoveries of subsequent prebiotic researchers was that they synthesized components (or at least close relatives) of all four groups—carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid membranes. No wonder
so many researchers were optimistic that an understanding of life’s
emergence was at hand.
But this molecular catalog of success ignores a puzzling part of the
prebiotic synthesis story. For every useful molecule produced, many

other species with no obvious biological function complicate the picture. Take sugar molecules, for example. All living cells rely on two
kinds of 5-carbon sugar molecules: ribose and deoxyribose. Sure
enough, several plausible prebiotic synthesis pathways yield small
amounts of these essential sugars. But for every one of these molecules
produced, many other 5-carbon sugar species also appear—xylose, arabinose, and lyxose, for example. Adding to this chemical complexity is
a bewildering array of more than 100 3-, 4-, 6-, and 7-carbon sugars, in
chain, branching, and ring structures—of which life uses only a small
handful.
As if that weren’t enough of a problem, life is even choosier about
its molecules. Many organic molecules, including ribose and deoxyribose, come in mirror-image pairs. These left- and right-handed varieties are in most respects chemically identical. They possess the same
chemical formula and many of the same physical properties—identical melting and boiling points, for example. But they differ in their
shapes, just like your left and right hands. Laboratory synthesis usually
yields equal amounts of left- and right-handed sugars, but finicky life
employs only the right-handed sugars, never the left.
Given the disparity between the rich variety of prebiotic molecules
and the apparent paucity of biomolecules, is it possible that we’re fooling ourselves? Might the earliest life-forms have used a more diverse
suite of organic molecules and a different repertoire of biochemical
pathways? It turns out that living cells hold clues that are now being
teased out by the remarkable field of molecular phylogeny.
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY AND
THE “LAST COMMON ANCESTOR”
The complete chemical arsenal of each living species is recorded in its
unique genome, an encoded sequence of millions to billions of DNA
“letters,” the base pairs that form the rungs of DNA’s double helical
ladder. The four-letter DNA alphabet—A, G, T, and C (for the purines
adenine and guanine and the pyrimidines thymine and cytosine)—is
sufficient to spell out all the genetic information of any organism.
What’s more, all cells share the same mechanism for converting genetic instructions into the proteins that serve in many chemical and
structural roles. That’s why genetic engineers can use a simple bacte-

rium, such as E. coli, to synthesize human growth hormone, or insulin,
or other valuable pharmaceuticals.
A central assumption of molecular phylogeny is that the genomes
we see today evolved over billions of years from earlier ancestral cells,
via the gradual mutation of DNA sequences. Comparative examination of many genomes reveals marked similarities, as well as important
differences that have inexorably arisen by this slow evolutionary process. Differences among DNA sequences suggest the evolutionary
branching; the more dissimilar the sequences of two species, the longer
ago they are likely to have split from a common ancestor. DNA sequences that show little variation among many diverse species (socalled highly conserved sequences) are more likely to represent ancient,
essential biochemical traits.
The power and promise of phylogenetic analysis is epitomized in a
remarkable recent study of early English literature. University of Cambridge biochemists Adrian Barbrook and Christopher Howe teamed
with British literary scholars to analyze 58 different fifteenth-century
manuscript copies of the Wife of Bath’s Prologue from Geoffrey
Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales. No copy of the late fourteenthcentury original in Chaucer’s hand is known, and significant variations among the many early hand-copied sources raise doubts regarding the author’s original text.
For their Chaucer analysis, Barbrook, Howe, and co-workers employed the same computer techniques used by evolutionary biologists
to identify the most primitive organisms. They entered each of the
Prologue’s 850 lines from all 58 versions into the computer and
searched for textual similarities and differences. Features common to
most sources presumably reflected the original text, while variations
that arose from copying errors or deliberate changes were used to construct a kind of genealogy of the manuscripts.
The British team found that 44 manuscripts fell neatly into 5
groups, evidently descended from 5 different copying sources. (The
remaining 14 showed more extreme deviations and were eliminated
from consideration.) One group of 11 manuscripts proved crucial, for
it lay much closer to the presumed original than the others. Surprisingly, these 11 texts had received comparatively little study from literary scholars. “In time, this may lead editors to produce a radically
different text of The Canterbury Tales,” Barbrook and colleagues
concluded.

Computer-aided analysis of several dozen hand-copied manuscripts of Geoffrey
Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales points to several distinct groups of texts, denoted by letters. Each manuscript is represented as a line on this diagram; the length of the lines
corresponds to the amount of deviation from a presumed primary source. Of these,
the groups marked “O” appear to be closest to Chaucer’s lost original (after Barbrook
et al., 1998).

Molecular phylogenists adopt the same analytical approach. Their
“texts” consist of strands of genetic molecules—DNA or its close
cousin, RNA—with long sequences of the genetic letters. Thanks to
new, rapid sequencing techniques, numerous genomes have been
documented, including more than a hundred genomes of various microbes. Phylogenists use powerful computer algorithms to compare
their genetic texts.
The universally acknowledged pioneer of molecular phylogeny is
University of Illinois geneticist Carl Woese, a shy and retiring maverick
who had to wait many years for widespread scientific acceptance of his
ideas. In a landmark 1977 article in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, “Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: The primary kingdoms,” Woese and Illinois colleague George
Fox uprooted what had become the firmly established tree of life. Prior

THE MACROMOLECULES OF LIFE

to the “Woesian revolution,” most biologists recognized five kingdoms
of living organisms: animals, plants, fungi, protoctists (complex singlecelled organisms with a membrane-bounded nucleus), and bacteria
(metabolically diverse organisms that lack a nucleus). Based on his
laborious phylogenetic analyses (which were much more difficult in
the 1970s than they are today), Woese realized that animals, plants,
fungi, and eukaryotes are remarkably similar in their biochemical characteristics and so constitute just one domain of life, the Eukarya.
Prokaryotes, on the other hand, displayed astonishing chemical diversity and fell into two distinct kingdoms, which he called Bacteria and
Archaea. Bacteria were well known for their role in causing disease, but
the Archaea, that as prokaryotes resemble other bacteria in many ways,
constituted an unrecognized group of microbes. So contentious was
this view of life that it took almost two decades to gain general acceptance.
In retrospect, the lateness of Woese’s discovery should not seem
too surprising. Most species in the two microbial kingdoms, Bacteria
and Archaea, occur as nondescript microscopic spheres or rods that
are virtually impossible to distinguish, even with sophisticated chemical and physiological tests. Consequently, previous workers lumped
them all together. Only after the application of molecular phylogeny
did the profound differences become obvious.
Woese’s initial intention was to unravel aspects of evolution—to
establish a top-down family tree of life and infer the complex history
of branchings from parent to daughter species. This evolutionary pursuit led quickly to insights regarding the nature of the last common
ancestor. He proposed, for example, that Archaea and Bacteria arose
long before Eukarya.
Other discoveries followed. Many of the most primitive microbes
are extremophiles that thrive at elevated temperature. To many researchers, Woese’s discoveries thus lent credence to the idea of a deep,
hot emergence of life. Other scientists, however, quickly took issue with
that conclusion. Deep microbes might well have been the only survivors following a massive asteroid impact and thus, by default, became
the last common ancestors of life on Earth today. But those heat-loving microbes might well have evolved from strains of earlier, surfacedwelling cells.
Recent studies point to other intriguing possible characteristics of
the presumed last common ancestor. For example, many of the most
primitive Archaea are autotrophs, organisms that synthesize their own

Carl Woese compared the genetic sequence of many different organisms, especially
microbes, to construct a phylogenetic tree of life. He found three distinct branches of
life, including the previously unrecognized Archaea. The majority of the most deeply
rooted organisms are extremophiles living at high temperature (after Pace, 1997).

biomolecules. However, many origin specialists, Stanley Miller and his
colleagues among them, have long argued that the first cells must have
been heterotrophs, which scavenge molecules from their environment.
Once again, the controversy cannot be resolved by phylogenetic studies, for deep-dwelling autotrophs that evolved from surface heterotrophs might have been the sole survivors of a globe-sterilizing event.
Additional complexity arises from the tendency of microbes to
swap sections of DNA. Remarkably, throughout the history of life, cells
have picked up chunks of DNA from completely different species to
form new, hybrid genomes. Thus the idealized view of an unbroken
branching history of DNA evolution from parent to daughter is invalid. There is no single “last common ancestor.”
In spite of these uncertainties, molecular phylogeny provides invaluable information regarding the shared biochemical heritage of all
cells—information that continues to inform origins research. Two observations stand out. First, all cells employ RNA to carry genetic information and assemble proteins. The earliest genetic mechanism thus
points to an ancient “RNA World” (see Chapter 16). Second, at the
heart of every cell’s chemical machinery lies a simple metabolic strategy called the citric acid cycle, which is powered by simple chemical
reactions. Any successful model of life’s emergence must thus account
for the origin of this cycle (see Chapter 15).
An important conclusion from these phylogenetic studies is that
Earth’s earliest cells were not so different from those of today. They
probably relied on similar, though simpler, biochemical pathways.
Those similarities provide a clear focus for experimental studies of
emergent biochemistry.


The greatest challenge in understanding life’s emergence lies in finding mechanisms by which just the right combination of smaller molecules was selected, concentrated, and organized into the larger
macromolecular structures like RNA and in self-replicating cycles of
molecules like the citric acid cycle. But regardless of how much organic stuff was made, the primordial ocean—with an estimated volume greater than 320 cubic miles—formed a hopelessly dilute soup in
which it would have been all but impossible for the right combination

of molecules to bump into one another and make anything useful in
the chemical path to life. Complex emergent systems require a minimum concentration of interacting agents. Many scientists have therefore settled on an obvious solution: Focus on surfaces, where
molecules tend to concentrate.
Interesting chemistry takes place on surfaces where two different
materials meet and molecules often congregate. The surface of the
ocean, where air meets water, is one such promising place. Perhaps a
primordial “oil slick” concentrated organic molecules. Evaporating
tidal pools, where rock and water meet and cycles of evaporation concentrate stranded chemicals, represent another appealing location for
origin-of-life chemistry. Deep within the crust and in hydrothermal
volcanic zones, mineral surfaces may have played a similar role, selecting, concentrating, and organizing molecules on their periodic, crystalline surfaces. Whatever the mise-en-scène, a surface seems a logical
site for life’s origin.
But just suppose a collection of organic molecules could organize
themselves in such a way that they provided their own surface? Now
that would be a trick worth learning!

Interlude—God in the Gaps
Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents
them with one of their most insoluble problems. They
believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from
an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea
and lost its legs.
. . . . A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would
not be fitted for life on land or sea, and would have no
hope of survival.

his rant by Alan Haywood, and similar silly statements by his
creationist colleagues, reveals a deep mistrust of the scientific
description of life’s emergence and evolution. But he is correct in
one sense. Science is a slave to rigorous logic and inexorable
continuity of argument. If life has changed over time, evolving
from a single common ancestor to today’s biological diversity,
then many specific predictions about intermediate life-forms must
follow. For example, transitional forms between land mammals
and whales must have existed sometime in the past. According to
the creationists in the mid-1980s, the lack of such distinctive
forms stood as an embarrassing, indeed glaring, proof of
evolution’s failure. Their conclusion: God, not Darwinian evolution, must have bridged the gap between land and marine animals. But what appeared to them as an embarrassment for science
then, has since underscored the power of the scientific method.
Science differs from other ways of knowing because scientific
reasoning leads to unambiguous, testable predictions. As
Haywood so presciently predicted, whales with atrophied hind
legs must have once swum in the seas. If Darwin is correct, then

somewhere their fossils must lie buried. Furthermore, those
strange creatures must have arisen during a relatively narrow interval of geological time, bounded by the era before the earliest
known marine mammals (about 60 million years ago) and the
appearance of streamlined whales of the present era (which appear in the fossil record during the past 30 million years). Armed
with these predictions, several paleontologists plotted expeditions
into the field and targeted their search on shallow marine formations from the crucial gap between 35 and 55 million years ago
for new evidence in the fossil record. Sure enough, in the past
decade paleontologists have excavated more than a dozen of
these “missing links” in the development of the whale—curious
creatures that sport combinations of anatomical features characteristic to both land and sea mammals.
Moving back in time, one such intermediate form is the 35million-year-old Basilosaurus—a sleek, powerful, toothed whale.
This creature has been known for more than a century, but a recent discovery of an unusually complete specimen in Egypt for
the first time included tiny, delicate vestigial hind leg bones. That’s
a feature without obvious function in the whale, but such atrophied legs provide a direct link to four-limbed ancestral land
mammals.
And then a more primitive whale, Rodhocetus, discovered in
1994 in Pakistani sediments about 46 million years old, has more
exaggerated hind legs, not unlike those of a seal. And in that same
year paleontologists reported the new genus Ambulocetus, the
“walking whale.” This awkwardly beautiful 52-million-year-old
creature represents a true intermediate between land and sea
mammals.
Nor does the story end there. In September 2001, the cover
stories of both prestigious weekly magazines Science and Nature
trumpeted the discovery of a new proto-whale species that had
just been reported from rocks about 50 million years old. Nature’s
cover story, titled “When whales walked the earth,” underscores
the power of science and the futility of the creationists’ task. Science makes specific, testable predictions. Anyone can go out into
the natural world and test those predictions. The creationists were
wrong.
Today’s creationists have toted out a new version of this old

“God-in-the-gaps” argument under the fancy name “intelligent
design.” Their argument goes like this. Life is so incredibly complex and intricate that it must have been engineered by a higher
being. No random natural process could possibly lead from nonlife to even the simplest cell, much less humans. The promoters,
notably Michael Behe and William Dembski, don’t talk about
“God,” but they leave open the question of who designed the
designers.
Such an argument is fatally flawed. For one thing, intelligent
design ignores the power of emergence to transform natural systems without conscious intervention. We observe emergent complexity arising all around us, all the time. True, we don’t yet know
all the details of life’s genesis story, but why resort to an unknowable alien intelligence when natural laws appear to be sufficient?
I also see a deeper problem with intelligent design, which I
believe trivializes God. Why do we have to invoke God every
time we don’t have a complete scientific explanation? I am
unpersuaded by a God who must be called upon to fill in the
gaps of our ignorance—between a cow and a whale, for example.
The problem with this view is that as we learn more, the gaps
narrow. As paleontologists continue to unearth new intermediate
transitional forms, God’s role is squeezed down to ever more
trivial variations and inconsequential modifications.
Isn’t it more satisfying to believe in a God who created the
whole shebang from the outset—a God of natural laws who
stepped back and doesn’t meddle in our affairs? In the beginning
God set the entire magnificent fabric of the universe into motion.
Atoms and stars and cells and consciousness emerged inexorably,
as did the intellect to discover laws of nature through a natural
process of self-awareness and discovery. In such a universe, scientific study provides a glimpse of creator as well as creation.

The Emergence of Biomolecules

T

he top-down study of life’s origin—via the examination of ancient
fossils—doesn’t tell us much about early biochemistry. Fossil cells,
molecules, and isotopes are indistinguishable from those of contemporary life-forms; consequently, from them we can gain detailed
knowledge only of the final state—modern cellular life.
Nevertheless, common sense points to the essential first step in
life’s emergence—the synthesis and accumulation of abundant organic
(that is, carbon-based) molecules, such as amino acids, sugars, and
other vital molecules of which life would eventually be made. In the
beginning, life’s raw materials consisted of water, rock, and the simplest and most basic volcanic gases—carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and
maybe a little methane and ammonia. Add energy to the mix and organic molecules emerge.
The experimental pursuit of this ancient process, arguably the best
understood aspect of life’s chemical origins, began in earnest just over
a half-century ago, with the pioneering studies of University of Chicago graduate student Stanley Miller and his distinguished mentor,
Harold Urey. Together they demonstrated the organic synthesis that
occurred as Earth’s primitive atmosphere and ocean were subjected to
bolts of lightning and the Sun’s intense radiation. Chemical processes
in deep space, in the solar nebula, during asteroid and comet impacts,
and even within the pressure cooker of Earth’s deep interior, also generated abundant organic molecules. By 4 billion years ago, Earth’s
globe-spanning ocean must have become a complex, albeit dilute, soup
of life’s building blocks. Though not alive, this chemical system was
poised to undergo a sequence of increasingly complex stages of molecular organization and evolution.

Stanley Miller’s Spark of Genius
The idea that the organic compounds that serve as the basis of
life were formed when the earth had an atmosphere of
methane, ammonia, water, and hydrogen instead of carbon
dioxide, oxygen, and water was suggested by Oparin and has
been given emphasis recently by Urey and Bernal. In order to
test this hypothesis an apparatus was built. . . .
Stanley L. Miller, Science, May 15, 1953

he experimental investigation of life’s origin is a surprisingly recent game. Two centuries ago, many scientists accepted the intuitively reasonable idea, championed by Aristotle and a pantheon of
other ancient scholars, that a life force permeates the cosmos. A central
precept of this doctrine, known as vitalism, is that life arises spontaneously all around us, all the time. The question of life’s origin wasn’t
asked—at least not in the modern experimental sense.
Think about your own experience and you’ll see why this idea of
spontaneous generation isn’t such a strange notion. Mold seems to
grow spontaneously on bread, maggots appear as if by magic in old
meat, and every spring new plants sprout and grow in the season of
renewal. It’s not surprising that so many people, for so long, accepted
unquestioningly the spontaneous generation of life.
This view continued well into the nineteenth century, though not
without a number of respected dissenters and considerable debate. The
seventeenth-century invention of the microscope and the subsequent
realization that microscopic life abounds complicated the story, but
failed to resolve the controversy. Those who favored spontaneous generation saw microbes as just another manifestation of the life force;

those opposed saw microscopic life as an obvious source of experimental contamination.
The interpretation of experiments is rarely unambiguous, as highlighted by a delicious eighteenth-century exchange. The noted Italian
physiologist Lazzaro Spallanzani explored spontaneous generation by
comparing the behavior of boiled and unboiled sealed flasks, each filled
with bacteria-infested, nutrient-rich water. He found that flasks boiled
for an hour remained sterile indefinitely as long as they remained
sealed, whereas unboiled flasks quickly became cloudy with microbes.
Spallanzani concluded that ubiquitous microscopic life-forms contaminate any unsterilized experiment.
Englishman John Needham, an astute amateur experimenter who
conducted his own fragrant experiments on hot mutton gravy, came to
a different conclusion. Needham agreed that boiling kills microbes, but
microbes soon reappeared in abundance when his gravy cooled. He
argued that these cells arose by spontaneous generation. Spallanzani
countered that Needham’s microbes came from airborne contamination and, to prove his point, he undertook a new series of experiments
in which he demonstrated that no microbes appeared when he pumped
air out of his flasks and then boiled the water. Needham disagreed: A
property of the air, not the water, must carry the life force, he said.
We react to this historical incident with a biased worldview. Of
course Spallanzani’s conclusions about microbial contamination were
right and Needham’s support of spontaneous generation was wrong,
we are tempted to say. But a naïve and impartial observer of the time,
faced with these conflicting claims, would have had a difficult time
choosing between invisible microbes and an invisible life force. Both
arguments were internally consistent, so doubts remained.
The influential French chemist Louis Pasteur helped to abolish vitalism and the theory of spontaneous generation once and for all with
his own brilliant series of experiments on sterilization. He prepared a
nutrient-rich sugar solution and poured it into several beakers. One
set of beakers was tightly sealed to prevent any contact with the ambient air. Other beakers were left open with a narrow twisting neck, so
that the sugar solution was in contact with the ambient air, but unlikely to be contaminated by stray microbes, which were unable to
traverse the long glass passage. As a control, he left other beakers wide
open or deliberately contaminated them with ordinary dust. He
showed that boiled water, if isolated from airborne microbes, remained

sterile indefinitely. Only microbial contamination causes new growth,
not spontaneous generation—a result of tremendous practical as well
as theoretical consequence. His discoveries proved of immense importance in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases, while his development of the pasteurization process transformed the production and
preservation of food and, perhaps more important to French merchants, beer.
In the course of his elegant work, Pasteur also contributed directly to the study of life’s origin. By introducing the dictum that no
life can occur without prior life, his findings pushed back life’s origin
to an inconceivably remote time and place. How could anyone make
observations or perform experiments to study an event so ancient and
inaccessible?

SPECULATION
In 1871, Charles Darwin penned a speculative letter to his friend, the
botanist Joseph Hooker. “If (and Oh! What a big if !),” he wrote, “we
could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia
and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc., present, that a protein
compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes. . . .” Many contemporary chemists must have agreed that
life’s origin, wherever and however it occurred, depended on three key
resources.
First and foremost, terrestrial life requires liquid water, the essential growth medium for all living things. All living cells, even those that
survive in the driest desert ecosystem, are formed largely of water. Our
bodies are typically 70 percent water, while many foods are even more
water-rich. Surely the first cells arose in a watery environment.
Life also needs a ready source of energy. The radiant energy of the
Sun provides the most obvious supply for life today, but bolts of lightning, asteroid impacts, Earth’s inner heat, and the chemical energy of
certain unstable minerals have also been invoked as life-triggering energy sources.
And, third, life depends on a variety of chemical elements. All
known living organisms consume atoms of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, with a bit of sulfur and phosphorus and other elements
as well. Atoms of these elements combine in graceful geometries to
form essential biomolecules.

GENESIS

In spite of the intrinsic importance of the topic, Darwin’s private
musings about a chemical origin of life (which he never published)
flew in the face of conventional theology. “In the beginning, God created” was sufficient for most people, including a majority of the most
distinguished scholars of the time. Not until the 1920s did such scientific speculation take a more formal guise.
Most notable among that pioneering modern school of origin
theorists was the Russian biochemist Alexander Oparin. In 1922, while
still in his twenties and under the scrutiny of the Soviet hierarchy,
Oparin elaborated on the idea that life arose from a body of water that
gradually became enriched in organic molecules—the so-called
“Oparin Ocean” or the “primordial soup.” Somehow, he posited, life
emerged as these molecules clustered together and self-organized into
a chemical system that could duplicate itself. In many other cultures,
where religious doctrine colored thinking on origins, these revolutionary ideas would have been seen as heretical, but Oparin’s ideas resonated with the materialist philosophical worldview of the Soviet
leadership.
Many of Oparin’s postulates were echoed in 1929 in the independent ideas of British biochemist and geneticist J. B. S. Haldane.
Haldane, himself a Marxist activist, contributed a brief, perceptive
(many contemporaries would have said radical) article entitled “The
Origin of Life” to the eclectic secularist British periodical The Rationalist Annual. He speculated on the production of large carbon-based
molecules under the influence of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Given
such a chemical environment, Haldane envisioned the first living objects as self-replicating, specialized molecules.
Oparin and Haldane offered original and intriguing ideas. More
important, their ideas were subject to experimental testing, but for
some reason Oparin and his contemporaries didn’t try. It wasn’t until
after World War II, a time of exuberant, can-do scientific optimism,
that two chemists demonstrated a systematic experimental approach
to prebiotic chemistry.
EXPERIMENTS
The apparently universal requirements of water, energy, and chemicals
hint at a simple experimental approach for studying the origin of life.
Such landmark experiments were devised early in the 1950s by Univer-

sity of Chicago chemist Harold Urey, a Nobel Prize winner of great
renown, and his unknown second-year graduate student, the 23-yearold Stanley Miller.
Jeffrey Bada, a Miller student in the 1960s and an unswerving proponent of his teacher’s ideas in subsequent years, reveals some of the
behind-the-scenes context of the historic Chicago work in his 2000
book (coauthored with Christopher Wills), The Spark of Life. Urey
planted the seed for the now classic experiment in the fall of 1951,
when he presented a seminar attended by Miller, who was a beginning
graduate student. In that lecture and related publications, Urey proposed that life-triggering organic molecules might have been produced
in abundance in a plausible primitive atmosphere of hydrogen, methane, and other relatively reactive gases.
A year later, after trying his hand at an unsuccessful project in
nuclear theory, Miller asked Urey if he could attempt an experiment
with the hopes of synthesizing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. At first, so the story goes, Urey was reluctant and wanted Miller
to try an easier, safer research project. But after continued pressure
from Miller, Urey relented and gave his student a limit of one year to
make headway.
Scientists revere simple, elegant experiments, and that’s exactly
what Miller and Urey devised—a primitive Earth sitting on a tabletop
in a sealed glass vessel. [Plate 5] To the lower left, Miller positioned
a 5-inch-diameter (300-milliliter) flask filled two-thirds with water—
the primitive ocean. Glass tubing linked that flask to a 10-inchdiameter (5-liter) gas-filled flask, situated above and to the right.
Miller’s atmosphere consisted of the relatively reactive gases methane
(CH4, sold commercially as natural gas), ammonia (NH3, the strongsmelling component of ammonia-based cleaners), and hydrogen (H2,
the explosive lighter-than-air gas of Hindenberg fame). Two pointed
metal electrodes penetrated the upper flask to simulate “lightning” by
sparking, and a flame gently heated the water-filled flask to mimic the
ocean’s continuous evaporation. Sending sparks through a potentially
explosive mix of hydrogen and methane is not for the faint of heart,
nor would Miller’s unshielded glass apparatus have stood up to today’s
government safety standards. But it was an elegant experimental
design.
Following academic tradition, Miller the student performed the
experiments, while his mentor waited in the wings. Miller began by

pumping out the system to remove any traces of atmospheric oxygen.
Then he filled his apparatus with water and a 2:2:1 gas mixture of
methane, ammonia, and hydrogen. He heated the water, set off tiny
electric sparks in the gases to simulate lightning, and waited.
When the experiment began, the water was pure and clear, but
within a couple of days the solution had turned yellowish and a black
residue had begun to accumulate near the electrodes. It’s easy to imagine Stanley Miller’s excitement as he cut his first experiment short to
analyze the tantalizing products. Had he produced amino acids?
Organic chemical analysis was no easy chore in the early 1950s.
Miller resorted to paper chromatography, a classic and relatively quick
technique that separates different molecules into discrete colored spots
on absorbent paper. Miller opened the valve and removed the yellow
solution. Concerned that microbes might begin to grow in the liquid
and confuse his results, he added a lethal dose of mercury chloride to
preclude any bacterial contamination. Then, after the tedious routine
of drying down and concentrating his sample, he placed a small drop
of concentrated run product near one corner of the chromatography
paper. It dried as a small yellow dot.
Miller suspended the paper above a narrow trough filled with a
freshly made alcohol–water solution. He carefully lowered the paper so
that one edge close to the yellow spot just barely dipped into the clear
solution, which gradually soaked into the paper and rose up the sheet
by capillary action. As the alcohol solution moved, it carried the unknown molecules along with it. Within a few minutes the chemical
spot had been smeared out into a narrow, 3-inch-long streak of unknown, mostly invisible chemicals.
Miller let his paper dry, rotated it 90 degrees, and repeated the
process with a second solvent, this time a phenol solution. Molecules
move differently through paper under the influence of different solvents, so this second step spread the 3-inch streak of chemicals into a
diagnostic two-dimensional pattern of spots. After a second drying,
Miller’s final step was to treat the paper with ninhydrin, a chemical
that stains otherwise invisible amino acids into distinctive colors.
Almost immediately a discrete purple spot appeared exactly at the
expected position for glycine (C2H5NO2), the simplest of life’s amino
acids. Starting with nothing more than water and a few simple gases,
Miller had made one of life’s essential biomolecules. The graduate stu-

dent and his advisor were elated, for the tabletop experiment had
worked much faster than they expected.
Miller repeated the entire experiment for a week’s duration, cranking up the heat to a slow boil. The results were amazing. The water
quickly yellowed, then gradually turned intriguing shades of pink and
eventually to a deep red, while black gunk oozed down the sides of the
larger flask. This time when Miller analyzed the contents of the flask,
he found a complex mixture of organic molecules including at least a
half-dozen different amino acids. Reactions of water and air had produced organic molecules in abundance.
Harold Urey encouraged the young investigator to write up his
results immediately. Miller obliged and submitted a short manuscript
to the high-profile journal Science in mid-February 1953, a scant five
months since the project’s inception. Urey also generously withdrew
his name from the paper so that the graduate student, not the Nobelist,
would receive the lion’s share of credit.
Stanley Miller’s first publication was a bombshell. His two-page
article in the May 15, 1953, issue of Science announced “A Production
of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions.” The press
had a field day. The New York Times printed a feature story, LIFE AND
A GLASS EARTH, while tabloids speculated about synthetic life crawling out of test tubes.

THE COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY
The Miller–Urey experiment transformed the science of life’s chemical
origins. For the first time, an experimental protocol mimicked plausible life-forming processes. For decades to come, Miller and his students would dominate the origin-of-life community.
Given such an exciting result, other groups jumped at the chance
to duplicate the amino acid feat. Independent confirmation of Miller’s
claims came within a few years from chemists at the University of
Bristol in England and at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.
(A careful search of the scientific literature also turned up a remarkably similar series of experiments that had been conducted decades
earlier by the German chemist Walter Löb.) Thousands of subsequent
experiments during the past half century have outlined the promise, as
well as the limitations, of this idea that life arose as a chemical process
at the surface of the Earth. Time and time again, variations of the

Miller–Urey process, including experiments using ultraviolet radiation,
different gas mixtures, powdered minerals, and more, have demonstrated the synthesis of life’s most basic building blocks. Relatively easy
to run, and now a relative cinch to analyze, these experiments continue
to be a sort of cottage industry in origin-of-life research circles.
This genre of experiments yields amazing results. Dozens of amino
acids have been synthesized from scratch, along with membraneforming hydrocarbons, energy-rich sugars and other carbohydrates,
and metabolic acids. The early inventories even included some of the
building blocks of the genetic molecules DNA and RNA, though at
first the 5-carbon sugar ribose (the “R” of RNA) and the two purines
essential to both, adenine (C5H5N5) and guanine (C5H5ON5), were
notably absent.
Much of this molecular diversity occurs because electric sparks
and ultraviolet radiation trigger the formation of highly reactive
chemical species, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and formaldehyde
(CH2O), which readily link to other molecules. Miller suspected, for
example, that most of the amino acids produced in his experiments
arose by a chemical process known as Strecker synthesis, in which hydrogen cyanide reacts with formaldehyde and ammonia.
Enthusiasm grew as other scientists discovered promising
new chemical pathways. In 1960, John Oró of the University of Houston turned scientific heads when he discovered that a concentrated
hydrogen–cyanide solution, when heated, produced lots of adenine,
one of the missing purines and a crucial biomolecule that also plays a
role in metabolism. Other chemists conducted similar experiments,
starting with relatively concentrated solutions of formaldehyde
(CH2O), a molecule thought to be common in some prebiotic environments. These experiments produced a rich, though random, variety of sugars, including a modest yield of ribose. Gradually, through
such specialized experiments, gaps in the prebiotic inventory of life’s
molecules were filled in.
The experiments of Oró and others, relying as they did on relatively concentrated solutions of reactive organic molecules, raised some
eyebrows. The Miller-type spark experiments by themselves had never
yielded hydrogen cyanide in sufficient concentrations to produce much
adenine, or enough formaldehyde to make much ribose. But discoveries in the mid-1960s in the lab of Salk Institute pioneer Leslie Orgel
pointed to a plausible fix. The early Earth was not uniformly hot; it

probably had ice caps and may have periodically experienced more
extensive “ice ages,” as well. Orgel realized that such conditions might
promote intriguing organic reactions. When an organic-rich water solution freezes, pure water ice crystals grow, while the dwindling reservoir of residual liquid becomes an increasingly concentrated organic
brine (and recall that a higher concentration of “agents” may facilitate
emergence).
Orgel and co-workers exploited this idea by slowly freezing flasks
of dilute HCN solutions to –20°C. The procedure produced tiny volumes of extremely concentrated hydrogen cyanide, which reacted over
weeks to months to produce small linkages of up to four HCN molecules. This curious phenomenon became the inspiration for one of
the longest experiments in the history of origins research. Sometime in
the mid-1970s, Miller, now a professor at the University of California,
San Diego, and his co-workers repeated the Orgel protocol and stored
their frozen flasks in the back of a freezer. In the late 1990s, more than
two decades later, they removed the frozen solutions, which had developed curious dark concentrated clumps that were rich in organics.
Analysis revealed an abundant production of adenine. It takes a lot of
time for reactions to proceed at ultracold temperatures, but the primitive Earth had time to spare.
These remarkable results seem to defy convention: Heat, not cold,
normally drives chemical reactions. You don’t make a cake by freezing
batter. Nevertheless, additional freezing experiments have produced
amino acids and other interesting biomolecules by this counterintuitive process of concentration. In this curious way, prebiotic cycles of
freezing and thawing may have enhanced the emergence of biomolecules and thus provided a pathway to life.
DOUBTS
As exciting and important as the Miller–Urey results may be, seemingly intractable problems remain. Within a decade of Miller’s triumph, serious doubts began to arise about the true composition of
Earth’s earliest atmosphere. Miller and Urey had exploited a highly reactive atmosphere of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, which seemed
a plausible early atmosphere to them. But by the 1960s, new geochemical calculations along with data from ancient rocks pointed to a much

less reactive early atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, two
gases that do almost nothing of interest in a Miller–Urey apparatus.
Miller and his supporters continue to counter with a pointed argument, difficult to dismiss. Life’s biomolecules match those of the
original Miller–Urey experiment with great fidelity, they say. Doesn’t
that fact alone argue for an atmosphere rich in reactive methane?
Harold Urey is said to have often quipped, “If God did not do it this
way, then He missed a good bet.” Nevertheless, most geochemists now
discount the possibility of more than a trace of atmospheric methane
or ammonia at the time of life’s emergence.
Added to this atmospheric concern is the fact that the molecular
building blocks of life created by Miller and his colleagues represent
only tiny steps on the long road to life. Living cells require that such
small molecules be carefully selected and then linked together into
vastly more complex structures—cell membranes, protein catalysts,
DNA, RNA, and other so-called macromolecules. The prebiotic ocean
was an extremely dilute solution of many thousands of different
organic molecules, most of which play no known role in life. By
what emergent processes were just the right molecules selected and
organized?
The Miller–Urey scenario suffers from yet another nagging problem. Macromolecules tend to fragment, rather than form, when subjected to the energetic insults of lightning and the Sun’s ultraviolet
light. These so-called ionizing forms of energy are great for making
reactive molecular fragments that combine into modest-sized molecules like amino acids. Combining many amino acids into an orderly
chainlike protein, however, is best accomplished in a less destructive
energy domain. Emergent complexity relies on a flow of energy, to be
sure, but not too much energy. Could life have emerged in the harsh
glare of daylight, or was there perhaps a different, more benign origin
environment?
Faced with such an impasse, a few maverick scientists began to
look at other plausible venues for the cradle of life.

or centuries the primary source of life’s energy has been as well
established as any precept in biology. Every high-school textbook
proclaims what we all have accepted as intuitively obvious: All life depends ultimately on the Sun’s radiant energy. Nor has there been reason to doubt that claim until recently. But new discoveries of deep
life—life-forms at the darkest ocean depths and microbes buried miles
beneath Earth’s surface in solid rock, forever beyond the Sun’s influence—have toppled this comfortable certainty.
If science has taught us anything, it’s that cherished notions about
our place in the natural world often turn out to be dead wrong. We
observe that the Sun rises in the morning and sets at night. An obvious
conclusion, reached by almost all observers until relatively recently in
human history, is that the Sun circles the Earth. Yet we now know that
sunrise and sunset are consequences of Earth’s rotation; Earth orbits
the Sun, and we are not at the physical center of the universe. We observe mountains and oceans as grand unchanging attributes of the
globe—on the scale of a human life, these features are for all intents
and purposes permanent. Yet we have learned that through the inexorable processes of plate tectonics, every topographic feature on Earth is
transient over geological time and that our war-contested political
boundaries are destined eventually to disappear.
The great power of science as a way of knowing is that it leads us to
conclusions about the physical universe that are not self-evident. Repeatedly, the history of science has been punctuated by the overthrow

of the obvious. Could our intuitive view of life’s original energy source
be in error as well?

Copyright   2005. Joseph Henry Press. All rights reserved.

ENERGY
All living cells require a continuous source of energy. Without energy,
organisms cannot seek out and consume food, manufacture their cellular structures, or send nerve impulses from one place to another.
Lacking energy, they cannot grow, move, or reproduce. Reliable energy
input is also essential to maintain the genetic infrastructure of cells,
which are constantly subjected to damage by nuclear radiation, toxic
chemicals, and other environmental hazards.
Metabolism, the means by which organisms obtain and use energy, is an ancient chemical process that takes place in every living cell,
including all of the tens of trillions of cells in our bodies. Until recently, scientists claimed that the metabolic pathways of virtually all
life-forms rely directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. At the base of
the food web, we find plants and a host of one-celled organisms that
use the Sun’s light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into the
chemical energy of sugar molecules (carbohydrates) plus oxygen.
Plants manufacture carbohydrates, such as the starch of potatoes and
the cellulose of celery, to build leaves, stems, roots, and other physical
structures. They also process sugar molecules to provide a source of
chemical energy that powers the plant cell’s molecular machinery.
While plants synthesize their own carbohydrates, animals and
other nonphotosynthetic life higher up the food chain must find another source of sugar. That’s why we eat plants, or eat animals that eat
plants. Plants synthesize sugar molecules and oxygen from water plus
carbon dioxide. Our bodies convert sugar molecules along with the
oxygen we breathe to produce water plus the waste gas carbon dioxide.
There’s an elegant chemical symmetry to this story; the biological
world seemed much simpler when the Sun was life’s only important
energy source.
DEEP ECOSYSTEMS
Our view of life on Earth changed forever in February 1977, when Oregon State University marine geologist Jack Corliss and two crewmates

Pacific Rise, 8,000 feet down. This undersea ridge off the Galápagos
Islands was known to be a zone of constant volcanic activity associated
with the formation of new ocean crust. Oceanographers have documented thousands of miles of similar volcanic ridges, including the
sinuous Mid-Atlantic Ridge that bisects the Atlantic Ocean—the longest mountain range on Earth.
On this particular dive, just one of hundreds that Alvin had logged,
the scientists hoped to locate and examine a submarine hydrothermal
vent, a kind of submarine geyser where hot water jets upward into the
cool surrounding ocean. What Corliss and crew discovered was a vibrant and totally unexpected ecosystem with new species of spindly
albino crabs, football-sized clams, and bizarre 6-foot tubeworms. Onecelled organisms also abounded, coating rock surfaces and clouding
the water. These communities, thriving more than a mile and a half
beneath the sea, never see the light of the Sun.
In these deep undersea zones, microbes serve as the primary energy producers, playing the same ecological role as plants do on Earth’s
sunlit surface. These one-celled vent organisms exploit the fact that the
cold oxygen-infused ocean water, the hot volcanic water, and the sulfur-rich mineral surfaces over which these mixing fluids flow are not
in chemical equilibrium. This situation is similar to the disequilibrium
between a piece of coal and the oxygen-rich air. Just as you can heat
your house or power machinery by burning coal (thus combining unstable carbon and oxygen to make stable carbon dioxide), so too can
these deep microbes obtain energy by the slow alteration of unstable
minerals.
The unexpected discovery of this exotic ecosystem was news
enough, but Corliss and his Oregon State colleagues soon tried to push
the story further. They saw in the vents an ideal environment for the
origin of life. Details of this story have become clouded by more than
20 years of sometimes revisionist history. Corliss claims the idea for
himself: “I began to wonder what all this might mean, and this sort of
naïve idea came to me,” he told an interviewer more than a decade
later. “Could the hydrothermal vents be the site of the origin of life?”
[Plate 5]
A different history emerges from others close to the story. According to John Baross, a former faculty colleague of Corliss and an expert
on microbes in extreme environments, the hydrothermal vent theory
of life’s origin was first proposed and developed by a perceptive Or-

oceanography seminar taught by Charles Miller, another OSU oceanographer. Hoffman, in frequent consultation with Baross, developed
the novel idea as it would appear in print. The two of them claim that
the more senior Corliss seized the paper as his own, allowing them, as
his coauthors, to expand and polish the prose to conform to the conventions of scientific publishing, after which he submitted the work
and placed his name first on the author list. With three coauthors—
Corliss, Baross, and Hoffman—the paper would forever be known as
“Corliss et al.” Corliss would get the fame, while Hoffman and Baross
were effectively relegated to footnote status.
Whoever deserves the credit, the hydrothermal-origins thesis is elegantly simple and correspondingly influential. Modern organisms do,
in fact, thrive in deep hydrothermal ecosystems. Fossil microbes recovered from 3.5-billion-year-old hydrothermal deposits reinforce this
observation. Even without the energy of sunlight, nutrients and chemical energy abound in hydrothermal systems. The OSU scientists saw
hydrothermal systems as “ideal reactors for abiotic synthesis,” and they
proposed a sequence of chemical steps for the potentially rapid emergence of life.
The controversial manuscript was not eagerly received; it bounced
around for the better part of a year. First it was rejected by Nature, then
by Science. At the time, Stanley Miller and his protégés dominated the
origin-of-life research game, which had seen more than its fair share of
quacks and crackpot theories. They were not about to let such unsupported speculation sully their field. Hydrothermal temperatures were
much too hot for amino acids and other essential molecules to survive,
they said. “The vent hypothesis is a real loser,” Miller complained to a
reporter for Discover magazine. “I don’t understand why we even have
to discuss it.”
Miller’s followers found other good reasons to attack the paper.
Corliss and co-workers had the ancient ocean chemistry all wrong, they
said. Modern hydrothermal ecosystems rely on oxygen-rich ocean water, whose composition is an indirect consequence of plants and photosynthesis. The prebiotic ocean would not have been oxygen-rich, so
the proposed life-sustaining chemical reactions would have proceeded
slowly, if at all. The bottom line? Decades of Miller-type experiments

confirm what is intuitively obvious: Life began at the surface, so why
confuse the issue?
Eventually the Corliss, Baross, and Hoffman manuscript was published, in a supplement to the relatively obscure periodical
Oceanologica Acta, a journal that not one in a hundred origin-of-life
researchers would see. Nevertheless, good ideas have a life of their own,
and copies of the paper, entitled “An Hypothesis Concerning the Relationship Between Submarine Hot Springs and the Origin of Life on
Earth,” began circulating. I have seen dog-eared underlined photocopies of copies of copies on several colleagues’ desks, and I have a
pretty battered copy of my own.
New support for the idea gradually consolidated, as hydrothermal
ecosystems were found to be abundant along ocean ridges in both the
Atlantic and Pacific. It was realized that at a time when Earth’s surface
was blasted by a continuous meteorite bombardment, deep-ocean ecosystems would have provided a much more benign location than the
surface for life’s origin and evolution. New discoveries of abundant
primitive microbial life in the deep continental crust further underscored the viability of deep, hot environments. By the early 1990s, the
deep-origin hypothesis had become widely accepted as a viable, if unsubstantiated, alternative to the Miller surface scenario.
Of the three authors, only John Baross remains active and influential in the field. In 1985, he accepted a professorship at the University
of Washington, where he has developed a leading research program on
hydrothermal life. His work on deep-sea-vent microbes, often in collaboration with his wife, Jody Deming, who is also a professor of oceanography at the University of Washington, has placed Baross at the
forefront of the highly publicized research field of “extremophile” microbes. Sarah Hoffman’s graduate work in geochemistry was interrupted by illness, and, after her recovery, she pursued a singing career.
As for Corliss, always a bit idiosyncratic, in 1983 he left Oregon for the
Central European University in Budapest, where he worked briefly on
the deep-origins hypothesis, but soon took up research in the more
abstract field of complex systems. After a 3-year stint as director of
research at the controversial Biosphere 2 environmental station in Arizona, he returned to Budapest, having abandoned studies of the deep
ocean.

LIFE IN ROCKS
Following the revolutionary hydrothermal-origins proposal, numerous scientists began the search for life in deep, warm, wet environments. Everywhere they looked, it seems—in deeply buried sediments,
in oil wells, even in porous volcanic rocks more than a mile down—
microbes abound. Microbes survive under miles of Antarctic ice and
deep in dry desert sand. These organisms appear to thrive on mineral
surfaces, where interactions between water and chemically unstable
rocks provide the chemical energy for life.
One of the most dramatic and difficult pursuits involves deep drilling for life in solid rock. The oil industry has perfected the practice of
deep drilling, thanks to decades of experience and vast infusions of
cash. They can penetrate several miles into the Earth, drill at angles
and around obstacles, and cut through the hardest known rock formations in their quest for black gold. So the problem for geoscientists
looking for microbes a mile or more down isn’t how to get there, it’s
how to get there without contaminating the drill hole with hoards of
surface bugs. Bacteria are everywhere—in the air, in the water, and in
the muck used to lubricate and cool diamond drill bits as they cut
through layers of rock. It’s relatively easy to bring up rock cores from a
couple of miles down, but those slender cylinders of rock will have
already been exposed to surface life by the drilling process. What to do?
The commonest retrieval trick is to add a colorful dye or other
distinctive chemical tracer to the lubricating fluid. When drillers extract a deep core, it becomes obvious whether or not the rock has been
contaminated in the process. Porous sediments or highly fractured formations soak up the dye and thus prove unsuitable for analysis, but
many rocks turn out to be impermeable and thus are ideal for recovering deep life.
The search for subsurface microbes began in earnest in 1987, when
the Department of Energy decided to drill several 500-meter-deep
boreholes in South Carolina near the Savannah River nuclear processing facility. As cores were brought to the surface, drillers quickly isolated them in a sterile plastic enclosure with an inert atmosphere.
Researchers then cut away the outer rind of the drill core to reveal
pristine rock samples, which were shipped to analytical facilities across
the country. The results were spectacular. The deep South Carolina
sediments were loaded with microbes that had never seen the light of
day.

Subsequent drilling studies have revealed that microbes live in every imaginable warm, wet, deep environment—in granite, in basalt on
land and basalt under the ocean, in all variety of sediments, and also in
metamorphic rocks that have been altered by high temperature and
pressure. Anywhere you live, drill a hole down a mile and the chances
are you’ll find an abundance of microscopic life.

MINING FOR MICROBES
Earth’s deep mining and tunneling operations provide the new breed
of geobiologist with an invaluable complement to drilling. Mine tunnels have the advantage that researchers can visit microbial populations in their native habitat. Earth’s deepest mines, the fabled gold
mines of South Africa’s Witwatersrand District, have thus become the
site of the heroic and potentially dangerous efforts of Princeton geologist Tullis Onstott.
The East Driefontein Mine, located about 60 miles southwest of
Johannesburg, is a vast network of underground workings, reaching
more than 2 miles into the crust. A small army of miners labor around
the clock for gold. Despite one of the largest air-conditioning systems
in the world, these deep tunnels remain at an oppressive 140°F from
the heat of Earth’s interior, while air pressure is twice that of the surface. Onstott learned the dangers of the place on his first descent: “It
was ‘Don’t step there, don’t touch that,’” he told a writer for the
Princeton Weekly Bulletin. “All I knew is that it was deep and dark and
hot.”
Every so often, as miners blast new adits, a small flow of water
appears—groundwater that has spent countless thousands of years filtering down from the surface and has accumulated in small cracks and
fissures, nurturing a tenuous ecosystem of microbial life. Onstott’s
team, typically a half-dozen young and hearty students and postdocs,
camp at the surface with a functional array of sterile sample-collection
hardware at hand. When news of a fresh water flow comes in, they
scramble to the site, though the miles of elevators and tunnels can take
almost an hour to traverse. They have to work fast, both to avoid disruption of the mining routine and because prolonged exposure to the
hellish conditions can kill them.
They photograph the site, record its location and geological setting, and collect as many gallons of water as possible fresh from the

point of flow. They benefit from the seep’s positive water pressure,
which prevents much back contamination from the miners’ activities
or their own collection efforts. Exhausted and sweating profusely,
they lug the heavy water-filled bottles to the surface for further
investigation.
Remarkably, every single sample from Earth’s deepest mines holds
microbes that have never seen light, surviving on a meager supply of
underground chemical energy. Such deep life lives at a sluggish pace
that defies our experience. Isotopic measurements reveal that a single
cell may persist for thousands of years, “doing” almost nothing before
dividing into two. Colonies of organisms commonly remain isolated
from the surface for millions of years. So tenuous are the chemical
resources of these deep rocks that reproduction and growth are luxuries seldom indulged. By the same token, deep rocks provide an
unvarying safe and reliable environment: no predators, no surprises—
unless of course a miner happens to blast into your rocky home of a
million years!

THE DEEP HOT BIOSPHERE
The abundance of subterranean one-celled creatures, thriving far from
the light of the Sun, inspires the imagination and hints at novel scenarios for life’s origin. Of all the scientists in pursuit of deep life, none
displayed greater imagination than the late brilliant and pugnacious
iconoclast Thomas Gold.
Austrian-born Tommy Gold began his scientific career as an astrophysicist in Britain, but in 1959 he was lured to Cornell University
to head the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research. He would
achieve lasting scientific fame with his inspired theory that pulsars,
steady pulsating radio sources discovered in 1967, are actually rapidly
rotating neutron stars. Many honors, including election to the Royal
Society of London and the National Academy of Sciences, soon
followed.
Most scientists would have been content to excel in one chosen
area, but Gold throughout his career repeatedly ventured into new and
controversial academic domains. In the 1940s, he conducted experiments on hearing and the structure of the mammalian inner ear.
Speculative papers on dramatic instabilities of Earth’s rotation axis, on
steady-state cosmological models of the universe, and on the potential

danger to astronauts of deep powdery lunar soils peppered his lengthy
curriculum vitae.
In 1977, Gold, by then a safely tenured professor at Cornell, rattled
the well-established field of petroleum geology. Geologists had long
declared that petroleum is a fossil fuel, formed when huge quantities
of decaying cells accumulate over millions of years, to be buried and
processed by Earth’s heat and pressure. The evidence is overwhelming:
Petroleum occurs in sedimentary layers that once held abundant life;
petroleum is rich in distinctive biological molecules; petroleum’s carbon isotopes also point to a biological source. Armed with these and a
dozen other lines of evidence, the case for fossil fuels was open and
shut.
Gold disagreed. Petroleum holds lots of distinctive biomolecules,
to be sure, but oil fields also contain, along with methane, an abundance of helium gas—a light gas that quickly escapes into space and so
could only come from deep within the Earth. How could one reconcile
the mixing of deep helium with surface biology? Gold’s conclusion:
The organic molecules that eventually become petroleum are produced
deep underground by purely chemical processes and are then modified by the action of subsurface microbes.
In this scenario, vast sources of primordial hydrocarbons—the
major molecular components of oil—exist in Earth’s mantle. Because
they are lighter than the surrounding rocks, these hydrocarbons slowly
but surely rise toward the surface, constantly refilling petroleum reservoirs. In Gold’s heretical view, oil is thus a renewable resource instead
of a finite one built up over millions of years by the burial and decay of
once-living cells. In an extraordinary move, Gold first published this
novel idea as an op-ed piece in the June 8, 1977, issue of the Wall Street
Journal. An oil-hungry nation in the midst of an energy crisis took
considerable notice of the radical hypothesis.
A scientific theory is useful only if it is testable, and Gold soon
proposed a test of dramatic proportions. Gold’s oil-from-below hypothesis predicts that great oil fields should arise equally in many different types of rock, but all known petroleum has been found in layers
of exactly the kind of sedimentary formations that would have collected abundant remnants of past life. Gold countered, logically, that
petroleum geologists never look for oil anywhere but in those sedimentary formations. Perhaps, he suggested, immense new oil fields
were waiting to be found in igneous and metamorphic rock.

GENESIS

Armed with his provocative theory and a persuasive, dynamic oratorical style, he presented a simple (and expensive) proposal to the
Swedish State Power Board in 1983. Drill an oil well in solid granite—
the last place on Earth a petroleum geologist would look. He had targeted a unique and tempting granitic mass, the Siljan Ring impact site
in central Sweden. This highly fractured granite body, formed 368 million years ago when an asteroid shattered the crust, holds tantalizing
hints of petroleum in the form of carbon-filled cracks and flammable
methane seeps. Gold’s enticing rhetoric, amplified by increasing optimism from Dala Deep Gas, the company formed to do the drilling,
lured energy-poor Swedes into spending millions of dollars on exploratory holes.
Seven years and $40 million later, a 6.8-kilometer-deep hole had
produced only modest amounts of oil-like hydrocarbons and methane
gas—a small enough yield for oil experts to say “I told you so,” but
large enough to convince Gold that his theory was right. Where else, he
asked, could that trace of organic molecules have come from? Nevertheless, most scientists saw the Siljan experiment as a failure, and no
one is likely to drill for oil in granite again, at least anytime soon.
The modest production of methane gas and smelly, oily sludge
from the Swedish wells inspired Gold to elaborate on his theory. Extrapolating far beyond his peers, he described “the deep hot biosphere”
in several articles and a popular 1998 book of that title. The vast, deep
hydrocarbon reserves at the heart of Gold’s 1977 hypothesis provide a
wonderful food source for deep microbes, which coincidently leave
their biological overprint on the otherwise abiotic oil. In entertaining
prose, he reviewed the growing and accepted body of evidence for deep
life in many types of rock—all very reasonable stuff. Gold’s conclusion: Deep microbial life, much of it nourished by upwelling hydrocarbons, accounts for fully half of Earth’s total biomass. Though living
cells represent a tiny fraction of Earth’s total rock mass, the volume of
rock is so vast—a few billion cubic kilometers—that it shelters astronomical numbers of microbes. Inevitably, our view of life has been
skewed because these microscopic life-forms lie completely hidden
from everyday view.
In April 1998, I invited Gold to visit the Geophysical Lab and
present his ideas at our regular Monday morning seminar. Seemingly
unfazed by more than two decades of impassioned objections to his
views, he delivered a polished and forceful account of many lines of

evidence that petroleum is abiotic and rises from the depths. Geology,
biology, thermodynamics, experiments on organic molecules, carbon
isotopes, observations of diamonds, and, of course, the chemical properties of petroleum itself all came into play. Knowing our special interest in life’s origins, he underscored the possible role of this deep
hydrocarbon source in supplying critical molecules for prebiotic processes. Perhaps, he posited, life arose from those deep sources of organic molecules. Throughout the entertaining lecture, he bolstered his
controversial conclusions with rhetorical flourishes more suited to a
courtroom than a scientific seminar (“the only possible explanation,”
“no question remains,” the evidence “persuades one completely,” and
the like).
I doubt that anyone was persuaded completely, but we had to admire his creativity and conviction. And Tommy Gold helped to remind
us all, once again, how much we don’t know about the interior of our
planet just a few miles beneath our feet.

HEAVEN VERSUS HELL
If so many organisms exist beyond the Sun’s radiant reach, then geothermal energy, and the abundant chemically active mineral surfaces
that are synthesized in geothermal domains, must be considered as a
possible triggering power source for life. To be sure, sunlight remains
the leading contender for life’s original energy source. The vast majority of known life-forms do rely, directly or indirectly, on photosynthesis. In many scientific circles, a surface origin of life in a nutrient-rich
ocean, under a bright Sun, remains the seemingly unassailable conventional wisdom.
But that nagging problem of macromolecular formation remains.
Most known living species depend on the Sun directly or indirectly,
but the Sun’s harsh ultraviolet radiation inhibits the emergence of the
larger multimolecular structures on which all organisms depend. Furthermore, if the earliest life of almost 4 billion years ago was confined
to the sunlit surface, how did it escape the brutal, sterilizing final stages
of bombardment by asteroids and comets? As Gold said over and over
again, Earth’s surface, bathed in solar radiation and blasted by lightning, is the truly extreme environment.
And there’s another reason to look closely at the possibility of hydrothermal origins. If life is constrained to form in a sun-drenched

pond or ocean surface, then Earth, and perhaps ancient Mars or Venus,
are the only possible places where life could have begun in our solar
system. If, however, living cells can emerge from deeply buried wet
zones, then life may be much more widespread than previously imagined. The possibility of deep origins raises the stakes in our exploration of other planets and moons.
Jupiter’s fourth largest moon, Europa, presents a particularly
promising target for exploration. According to recent observations,
Europa is covered with a veneer of ice about 10 kilometers thick, covering a deep ocean of liquid water. Hydrothermal activity on the floor of
that ocean might be an ideal environment for life-forming chemistry.
Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, is another intriguing world. Though
much colder than Earth, Titan has an organic-rich atmosphere slightly
denser than Earth’s and, like all large bodies, its own sources of internal heat energy.
The idea that life may have arisen in a deep, dark zone of volcanic
heat and sulfurous minerals flies in the face of deeply ingrained religious metaphors. To many people, the Sun represents the life-giving
warmth of heaven, while sulfurous volcanoes are the closest terrestrial
analog to hell. How could life have come from such a dark, hostile
environment?
Nature is not governed by our metaphors, however cherished they
may be. Life as we know it demands carbon-based chemicals, a waterrich environment, and energy with which to assemble those ingredients into a self-replicating entity. Ongoing laboratory experiments that
simulate deep conditions as well as those on the surface—coupled with
observations of environments elsewhere in the solar system—will be
the ultimate arbiters of truth.

he first emergent step in life’s chemical origin, wherever it may
have occurred, must have been the synthesis of organic molecules.
Stanley Miller’s experiments amply demonstrated one potential ancient energy source with which to effect this synthesis—lightning near
the ocean–atmosphere interface. Subsequent workers, notably Thomas
Gold, postulated deeper origins and chemically derived energy sources.
Any plausible source of carbon-based molecules should be fair game
for origin researchers. Every plausible source deserves rigorous study.
In 1996, when George Cody, Hat Yoder, and I began our research
on hydrothermal chemistry and the origins of life, we were novices in
the origins game, too naïve to suspect that we were wasting our time.
We thought that our experimental studies of organic synthesis in hot,
high-pressure water provided compelling evidence that hydrothermal
zones could have played a role in the prebiotic production of life’s molecules. Stanley Miller and his students, most notably chemist Jeffrey
Bada at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, would have been
happy to set us straight, but we had yet to cross paths with them.
Harold Morowitz, whose ideas instigated the research, had warned us
that we might meet with some criticism. He was right.
It must have seemed odd to the scientific community that a group
of geologists and geophysicists was studying the origin of life. For al107

most a century, our home base, the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical
Laboratory, had supported research on the physics and chemistry of
Earth materials at extreme temperatures and pressures. Carnegie scientists had melted granite, synthesized basalt, and heated and squeezed
just about every known rock-forming mineral to understand how our
dynamic planet works. They routinely achieved temperatures of thousands of degrees and pressures of millions of atmospheres—extreme
environments that would seem to have little to do with life’s delicate
chemistry. Nevertheless, the lab’s arsenal of furnaces and pressure vessels stood ready to heat and squeeze almost any sort of sample, and
experiments on carbon compounds weren’t intrinsically different from
any other chemical we might have chosen to study.

EXPERIMENTS
Now, more than 2,000 experiments later, our hydrothermal organicsynthesis program is expanded, well funded by NASA, and going
strong. Our simple strategy, much in the spirit of Stanley Miller’s original experiments, has been to subject plausible prebiotic chemical mixes
of water, carbon dioxide, and minerals to a controlled environment—
in our case, a high-pressure and high-temperature environment typical of deep-ocean hydrothermal systems—still often employing the
classic gold-tube protocol described in the Prologue.
Our first experiments (the ones with pyruvate and carbon dioxide) were exhilarating. In that series we synthesized sugars, alcohols,
and a host of larger molecules, many incorporating dozens of carbon
atoms. Under extreme hydrothermal conditions, the pyruvate molecules polymerize; in some cases they form rings and branching structures reminiscent of molecules found in modern cells.
In a later set of experiments, we sealed water, nitrogen gas, and
powdered minerals into the gold tubes—a reasonable proxy for primitive conditions at some hydrothermal vents. In these experiments, we
produced ammonia, an essential starting material for synthesizing
amino acids and other biomolecules. Our work suggests that hydrothermal vents may have been one of the principal sources of the early
Earth’s ammonia. Carrying on with this line of experiments, we put
ammonia into a capsule with pyruvate and found that these two compounds react to form the amino acid alanine. By 1999, we had estab-

lished one plausible chemical pathway leading from simple carbon
compounds, nitrogen gas, and common minerals to key biomolecules.
In 1997, shortly after our initial exciting results, Cody, Yoder, and I
submitted our first papers for peer review. We believed optimistically
that our demonstrations of facile hydrothermal organic synthesis
would be welcomed as a logical extension of the Miller–Urey approach.
After all, we, like Miller a half-century before, had subjected a closed
vessel containing water and simple carbon-containing molecules to
heat. We had followed Miller’s lead in attempting to simulate a plausible prebiotic environment. And we, too, had found an abundance of
synthetic organic molecules. We thought the Miller camp might actually welcome our contribution. Boy, were we wrong!
Miller and his scientific cohort had staked their claim to a surface
origin of life, and they seemed determined to systematically head off
dissenting opinions. Their reasons were straightforward and clearly argued. While organic synthesis may occur near the 100°C limit of liquid
water, they argued, at the much higher temperatures of our experiments, the biomolecules of interest, notably amino acids, decompose
at a higher rate than they can be manufactured. Hydrothermal zones
on the early Earth would have destroyed many essential biomolecules
in the prebiotic ocean much faster than they could have been replenished. Such hostile zones were antithetical to life. We weren’t the first
researchers to suffer these criticisms: The Oregon State group who first
outlined the hypothesis of a hydrothermal origin of life following deepsea discoveries in Alvin had found themselves repeatedly thwarted by
this argument, their manuscript rejected time and again. However, we
were not about to follow their example by publishing in obscure conference proceedings.
Stanley Miller had been relentless in his offensive ever since the
hydrothermal-origins idea arose. In a 1988 article in Nature, Miller
and Jeffrey Bada wrote, “This proposal is based on a number of misunderstandings concerning the organic chemistry involved. . . . The high
temperatures in the vents would not allow synthesis of organic compounds, but would decompose them.” Miller was more blunt in a Discover feature in 1992, when he called the vent hypothesis “a real loser.”
In The Spark of Life, their popular book on origin theories, Bada
and Christopher Wills dubbed those of us working on the hydrothermal hypothesis “ventists,” making us sound a little like the members of

some fanatical religious cult. Their presentation is engaging and generally accurate, but like an argumentative rondo the old refrain appears again and again: “Vents are more likely to destroy organic
compounds than create them.” “This high temperature rapidly destroys
organic compounds rather than synthesizing them.” “At these high
temperatures, amino acids undergo total decomposition on a time
scale of only a few minutes.” “Vents . . . do terrible things to the primordial soup.” Piled onto this catchy litany were other criticisms: Our starting solutions were much too concentrated, the resulting products were
much too dilute, and our geological assumptions about vent-water circulation were incorrect.
Our immediate reaction to the assault was defensive and angry.
We saw the Miller camp as self-serving, defending old ideas while discounting new possibilities. Such turf-protecting tactics are not unknown in science, but we were more than a little dismayed by such
focused efforts to thwart what seemed an interesting and testable idea.
Our sense of a conspiracy arrayed against us was heightened when
anonymous reviewers recommended rejecting one of our grant proposals on the basis of familiar, party-line criticisms.
The most maddening aspect of Stanley Miller’s criticisms wasn’t
his persistence or even the public way he voiced them. The most maddening aspect was that he was basically right. Our first experiments
were admittedly flawed. Our starting mixtures of pyruvate were much
more concentrated than any plausible prebiotic solution; indeed, unstable pyruvate is unlikely as an important prebiotic reactant in any
environment. What’s more, we couldn’t control the acidity inside our
gold capsule (acidity can drastically alter reaction pathways), we
couldn’t be sure that all our products formed at high temperature (as
opposed to during cooling), and we hadn’t proved that the gold was an
inert container (might the gold have triggered the observed reactions?).
In short, it was a typical start to a complex scientific research program.
The art of science isn’t necessarily to avoid mistakes; rather,
progress is often made by making mistakes as fast as possible, while
avoiding making the same mistake twice. After several hundred experiments under a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, we
began to realize that water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are not sufficient by themselves to synthesize very many useful biomolecules. Under the right circumstances we could trigger some interesting organic
reactions, but many key biomolecules were missing from the inventory

of our products; and the ones we did manage to make were indiscriminate, with numerous molecules of no possible use to biology. We
needed some other chemical ingredient, or ingredients, and so our research led us back to my specialty—mineralogy. Minerals, it turns out,
have the potential to promote key chemical reactions, while protecting
the products from the ravages of high temperature.
Before biology, the only raw materials our planet had to play with
were the ocean, the atmosphere, and rocks. It now appears that rocks
and minerals, in roles as varied as containers, templates, catalysts, and
chemical reactants, may provide a key to understanding life’s ancient
origins.

ENTER WÄCHTERSHÄUSER
The view of minerals’ roles in the origin of life came to the fore with
the publication of a seminal paper in 1988: “Before enzymes and templates: Theory of surface metabolism,” by the brilliant, combative
Günter Wächtershäuser. Wächtershäuser, a chemist by training but a
Munich patent attorney by day, erected a sweeping theory of organic
evolution in which minerals—mostly iron and nickel sulfides, which
abound at deep-sea volcanic vents—provided catalytic, energy-rich
surfaces for the synthesis and assembly of life.
Among the many striking aspects of Wächtershäuser’s grand
scheme is the unusual extent to which he roots his theory in the philosophy of science. Most researchers tend to ignore science philosophers, whose work often seems removed from the practical day-to-day
details of experimentation. But Wächtershäuser is an avowed disciple
(and a personal friend) of the influential philosopher of science Karl
Popper, who encouraged the new theory’s development. “During
breakfast I mentioned my ideas on an alternative and he urged me to
work it out,” Wächtershäuser told a New York Times reporter not long
ago.
According to Popper’s dictum, theories, to be theories at all in the
scientific sense, must make testable predictions that might be proved
false by empirical tests. A theory that makes no testable predictions is
pseudoscience according to Popper. By the same token, the more precise (and, therefore, the more falsifiable) its predictions, the more believable a theory becomes when it survives scrutiny.
Most origins researchers before Wächtershäuser had adopted an

ad hoc, trial-and-error approach: They cooked up likely geochemical
recipes to see what worked, then patched together a theory around
those observations. Stanley Miller’s experiment made amino acids, so
his followers became convinced that that’s how it happened in nature.
“Ventists,” who found primitive life in hydrothermal zones, often fell
into the same trap. Theories flourished around particular sets of observations rather than grand falsifiable frameworks. By contrast,
Wächtershäuser set out to formulate his theory from scratch, starting
with a few plausible assumptions about the nature of the first living
entity.
Assumption 1. Reject the “primordial soup” concept. In
Wächtershäuser’s model, random prebiotic synthesis plays no essential role in life’s origin. He argues that the prebiotic emergence of
biomolecules à la Miller–Urey was irrelevant because the primordial
soup was too dilute and contained too many molecular species that
could not contribute to life. It takes a lot of nerve to throw out decades
of research, but that’s Wächtershäuser’s style.
Assumption 2. The first life-form made its own molecules. Most
other workers assume that the first living entity scavenged amino
acids, hydrocarbons, and other useful molecules from its surroundings—a strategy called heterotrophy (from the Greek for “other nourishment”). Wächtershäuser denies that possibility, since the soup was
so dilute and unreliable. He counters that the first life must have been
autotrophic (“self-nourishing”), manufacturing its own molecular
building blocks from scratch.
Assumption 3. The first life-form relied on the chemical energy of
minerals, not the Sun. Sunlight and lightning are both too violent, and
they are uncharacteristic of the energy sources most cells use today.
Moreover, photosynthesis is an immensely complex sequence of
chemical reactions, requiring numerous proteins and other specialized
molecules. Surface reactions on minerals, by contrast, are simple and
similar to the synthesis strategies central to many cellular processes
today.
Assumption 4. Metabolism came first. Many researchers claim that
life requires encapsulation and membranes, but simple membranes are
ill suited to let food in or waste out. Others, seduced by discoveries of
modern molecular genetics, are convinced that life began with a selfreplicating genetic molecule like RNA (see Chapter 16), but even the
simplest genetic molecule is vastly more complex than anything in the

Miller–Urey soup. Wächtershäuser, in sharp contrast to these more
conventional ideas, assumes that life began with metabolism, which he
defines as a simple cycle of chemical reactions that duplicates itself.
These key ideas are amplified by one additional assumption, common to all origin theories—that of biological continuity. Today’s biochemistry, no matter how intricate and dependent on specialized
catalysts, has evolved in an unbroken path from primordial geochemistry. Thus, for example, Wächtershäuser’s scheme builds on the observation that many of the molecules that enable today’s living cells to
process energy have, at their core, a mineral-like cluster of iron or nickel
and sulfur atoms.
But Wächtershäuser’s theory is much more than a list of assumptions. Over 100 pages of detailed chemical reactions—testable steps
that lead from simple geochemical raw materials to biology—amplify
his epic proposition. “You don’t mind if I brag a little,” he told a reporter for Earth in 1998, “but something like this has never been done
in the entire field.”
We’ll look at the details of Günter Wächtershäuser’s theory in
Chapter 15, but the central chemical idea is that iron and nickel sulfides, notably the common iron–sulfur minerals pyrrhotite and pyrite,
served as template, catalyst, and energy source for biosynthesis. In
Wächtershäuser’s view, simple molecules like carbon monoxide and
hydrogen react on sulfide surfaces to produce larger molecules. These
molecules tend to have negative charges and so they stick to the positively charged sulfide surfaces, where additional reactions build larger
and larger molecules. Various surface-bound molecules begin to feed
off each other, eventually forming a chemical cycle that copies itself.
Voilà! It’s alive! In Wächtershäuser’s view, this emergent process is both
inevitable and fast. “It takes maybe two weeks,” he estimated in answer
to a question at a Carnegie seminar.
Wächtershäuser’s theory has proven more than a little controversial, and it has evoked much discussion and comment, both pro and
con. “There’s probably nothing there because, otherwise, people would
have found it already,” Jeffrey Bada says. In a recent paper in Science, he
and his colleague Antonio Lazcano dismiss Wächtershäuser’s originality: “It’s not a new idea,” they write, pointing to a 1955 paper by the
Lithuanian-American microbiologst Martynas Ycas—a two-page
“Note on the origin of life” in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences that had comparatively little impact on the origins commu-

nity. Whatever one thinks of Wächtershäuser’s full-fledged and widely
cited theory, it cannot be dismissed as a mere restatement of earlier
ideas.
More than most scientists, Wächtershäuser seems to keep track of
who cites his work, who offers praise, who follows up with relevant
experiments. Though we had never met, he considered our Carnegie
group a friend. His provocative theoretical ideas had influenced our
experimental program. We had focused on the possibility that in the
presence of minerals—especially iron and nickel sulfides—metabolism
can proceed without protein catalysts. Many of our experiments served
to test his ideas. So in January 1998, as a member of the Lab’s seminar
committee, I invited Wächtershäuser to give a lecture. He responded
by phone less than a week later, and we agreed on a visit near the end of
March.
Intense and earnest, combative and to the point, Wächtershäuser
delivered his lecture like a legal summary to a packed, attentive room.
An hour proved not nearly enough to touch on the philosophy and
outline of his epic hypothesis, but many of us had read his papers and
followed as one does a favorite, oft-told tale. When he did touch on
other theories or dissenting views, he dismissed them quickly, efficiently, as if he were brushing away a pesky fly.
I should be clear: None of us was a Wächtershäuser disciple, nor
did any of us believe everything he proposed; indeed, the idea that
prebiotic chemistry and the primordial soup played no role in life’s
origins runs counter to the assumptions of many of our hydrothermal
synthesis experiments. But his origin-of-life model is amazingly rich
and detailed. Virtually every chemical step is testable by experiments.
Nothing is fuzzy or left to speculation. His daring lies in the prediction
of specific chemicals that arise by specific reaction pathways. Right or
wrong, Wächtershäuser has produced a synthesis that will be studied
by scientists for decades to come (and historians of science long after
that).
Following the seminar, several of us were eager to help test the
model in any way we could. That afternoon we showed him our extensive experimental facilities, described our origins research, and raised
the possibility of collaboration. Our offer was for him to propose the
experiments and be the lead author on any resulting publications. A
week later I wrote, “We would like to explore the possibility of collaborative experimental work, in particular the effects of modest pres-

politely, but was clearly reluctant and declined to accept our help. I
was left with the strong impression that Günter Wächtershäuser is
eager to maintain control over both his theory and its experimental
verification.

EXPERIMENTS
The hypothesis that minerals might enhance the stability of some
biomolecules received a boost from a series of experiments in 1999–
2000 conducted by my Carnegie colleague Jay Brandes. Brandes had
arrived at the Geophysical Lab fresh from his 1996 University of Washington PhD in oceanography—a study of nitrogen chemistry in the
Central Amazonian Basin of Brazil. Jay’s original proposal for work at
the Lab was to elaborate on the nitrogen work, but he soon shifted his
efforts to our origin-of-life program. It proved a good decision.
His first paper at Carnegie, “Abiotic nitrogen reduction on the early
Earth,” appeared in the September 24, 1998, issue of Nature and immediately gained widespread attention. Brandes demonstrated that
hydrothermal vents could have provided a reliable source of ammonia—an essential nitrogen-bearing compound for prebiotic synthesis.
He followed up by demonstrating the synthesis of amino acids under
ammonia-rich vent conditions.
In spite of these successes, studies by Stanley Miller’s group on the
rapid breakdown of amino acids had raised a question that would not
go away. Miller and his colleagues objected to the hydrothermal-origin hypothesis, in part, because amino acids decompose rapidly at the
elevated temperatures of ocean vents. How could we be making appreciable quantities of amino acids in our runs at 200°C, if these
chemicals aren’t stable? So Jay’s next round of experiments focused on
the breakdown of amino acids under a variety of geochemically relevant conditions.
Brandes’s new experiments found evidence that the amino acid
leucine, which breaks down in a few minutes in 200°C pressurized water, may persist for days when pyrrhotite, an iron–sulfur mineral commonly found at submarine volcanic vents, is added to the mix. While
the exact protection mechanism is still under study, Brandes’s experiments seemed to demonstrate that minerals may greatly enhance the
stability of essential biomolecules.

GENESIS

Two other intriguing lines of research point to the complexity of
determining amino acid stability. One recent set of experiments focuses on fossil bones, which often preserve ancient proteins. Fossil
bones are composite materials in which a strong but brittle mineral
matrix interweaves with flexible fibers of the proteins osteocalcin and
collagen. Unprotected, these proteins would break down in a matter of
a few centuries, but some fossil bones are known to preserve proteins
for many millions of years. Recent work in Andrew Steele’s laboratory
has even revealed hints of fossil collagen in dinosaur bones more than
70 million years old. The secret to such exceptional preservation is
strong bonding between minerals and the amino acid constituents of
the proteins. Minerals can thus protect and preserve amino acids.
Additional evidence for amino acid survivability comes from experiments conducted by Stanford graduate student Kono Lemke and
geochemist David Ross of the U.S. Geological Survey laboratories in
Menlo Park. Working with financial support from our NASA Astrobiology Institute grant, they placed amino acids in a superhot pressure
cooker and watched for them to decompose. But, unlike the protocol
of our restrictive gold-tube experiments, Lemke and Ross employed an
exotic flexible “gold bag” apparatus—a great improvement on the
sealed-tube experiments.
The heart of the gold-bag apparatus is a thin-walled flexible bag
about the size of a grapefruit, meticulously crafted from pure gold foil.
The bag opens at one end into a titanium-valve system, with which
Lemke and Ross filled and emptied their experimental solutions. They
immersed the entire gold assembly in a water-filled pressure chamber
that was compressed to several hundred atmospheres and heated to
several hundred degrees—conditions similar to those found at deepocean hydrothermal zones. Once they loaded and sealed the apparatus,
hot, pressurized water compressed and heated their sample container
uniformly on all sides.
The principle of the gold-bag apparatus is much the same as that
of our smaller gold-tube experiments. Both rely on soft, inert, deformable gold to exert uniform pressure and temperature on a fluid sample.
The great advantage of the gold-bag setup is that small samples of the
reacting fluid can be extracted every few hours or days throughout the
duration of a long experiment. But trade-offs are a fact of scientific
life. The disadvantage is that the thin-walled gold bag is frustratingly
fragile and can be a pain to use. A slight miscalculation and the bag will

rip, ruining an experiment and requiring a tedious and exacting welded
repair. But once properly filled with reactants, the device usually works
wonderfully well.
Lemke and Ross gingerly placed the bag into a water-filled pressure vessel, slowly filled the gold container with a solution of the amino
acid glycine and water, sealed the assembly, and ramped up the pressure and temperature. They ran their samples for weeks, monitoring
the solution, watching for the glycine to decompose. Over time, the
concentration of glycine steadily declined, but even though they didn’t
use minerals in their experiments, they observed a much slower rate
of breakdown than had been reported in previous studies at lower
pressure.
In addition, they found a surprisingly fast rate of peptide-bond
formation—amino acids linking together to form molecular chains.
This result was unexpected, because hot water tends to break apart
rather than form peptide bonds. (That’s one reason boiled foods are so
squishy—the sturdy bonds between amino acids that give food texture
break down.) Once formed, these peptides decomposed rather quickly,
but their formation pointed to more complex behavior than had been
expected.
Lemke and Ross found hints of another potentially important behavior in their gold bag. Single amino acid molecules and small clusters with just two or three molecules linked by peptide bonds readily
dissolve in water at room temperature, but longer peptide chains
proved much less soluble. Lemke and Ross imagine a scenario in which
peptides form rapidly in vents and are then exposed to the cooler seawater. Given a high enough concentration of long amino acid chains,
these molecules might separate out as a relatively stable concentrated
phase—just the kind of emergent molecular selection and organization that life’s origin required. There’s a lot more work to be done, but
it appears that the book is not yet closed on amino acid stability in
hydrothermal systems.
FIXING CARBON
The most fundamental biological reaction—and one of our group’s
primary goals in prebiotic-synthesis experiments—is carbon fixation,
the incorporation of more carbon atoms (starting with carbon dioxide) into organic molecules. After all, the first chemical step in the path

to life must be to make bigger molecules, like amino acids and sugars,
out of smaller ones, like carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water. Such
reactions occur rapidly in our experiments, but they follow two rather
different paths, depending on the mineral employed.
Many common minerals, including most oxides and sulfides of
iron, copper, and zinc, promote carbon addition by a routine, industrially important process known as the Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis.
In its idealized form, F–T synthesis builds long chainlike organic molecules from carbon dioxide and hydrogen that are exposed to hot, dry
metal surfaces. Our gold-tube experiments and studies in several other
labs display similar reactions in the presence of wet mineral surfaces at
high pressure, though a lot less efficiently than the industrial process.
Field studies complement these experiments. Recent intriguing
analyses of organic molecules emanating from hydrothermal vents reveal similar Fischer–Tropsch-like products, and it now appears that
F-T synthesis constantly manufactures larger organic molecules from
smaller building blocks in Earth’s hydrothermal zones. Many of these
molecules are hydrocarbons of the type that form petroleum. (Who
knows, maybe Tommy Gold is correct and at least some petroleum
forms abiotically at depth.)
Alternatively, when we use nickel or cobalt sulfides, we observe
that carbon addition occurs primarily by the insertion of carbon monoxide, a molecule with one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, which
readily attaches itself to nickel or cobalt atoms. By repeating these
simple kinds of reactions—add a carbon atom here, an oxygen or hydrogen atom there—over and over again, new and more complex organic molecules emerge.
One conclusion seems certain: Mineral-rich hydrothermal systems
contributed to the early Earth’s varied inventory of potential bio-building blocks. With tens of thousands of miles of deep-ocean hydrothermal ridges, billions of cubic kilometers of warm wet crust, and
hundreds of millions of years to process the raw materials, organic
molecules must have been produced in prodigious amounts. But the
Geophysical Lab synthesis experiments have done more than simply
add to the catalog of interesting molecules that could have been formed
on the early Earth. These experiments are now uncovering something
quite new about the possible role of minerals in the origin of life.
Previous origin-of-life studies, such as those of Günter
Wächtershäuser, treat minerals essentially as solid and relatively stable

platforms for synthesis and assembly of organic molecules. But our
experiments reveal another, more complex behavior that may have
important consequences for origin-of-life chemistry. We find that in
the presence of high-temperature and high-pressure water, minerals
often start to dissolve. In the process, the dissolved atoms and molecules from the minerals themselves become crucial reactants in the
prebiotic milieu. Sulfur, dissolved from sulfide minerals, combines with
carbon dioxide and water to form thiols and thioesters—reactive molecules that can jump-start new synthetic pathways.
Even more dramatic is the behavior of iron, which can dissolve in
water to form brilliantly colorful organic solutions. After one experimental run, George Cody bounced from office to office on the second
floor, showing off a particularly striking orange-red solution he had
just extracted from a pressure capsule. The deep color was exciting
because it pointed to the formation of iron complexes—iron atoms
surrounded by a starburst of organic molecules. Chemists have long
known that similar iron complexes promote chemical reactions, so
Cody speculated that our cheerful solutions might contain a kind of
primitive catalyst that promoted the assembly of more complex molecular structures.
Such behavior is not entirely unexpected, for hydrothermal fluids
are well known to dissolve and concentrate mineral matter. Many of
the world’s richest ore deposits arise from hydrothermal processes.
Similarly, spectacular sulfide pillars tens of meters tall grow rapidly at
volcanic vents called black smokers, where rising plumes of hot, mineral-rich solutions contact the frigid water of the deep ocean.
Yet there’s so much we don’t know about hydrothermal systems
and the chemical processes that might occur in their vicinity. And in
spite of their prevalence, the role of these dissolved ingredients has not
yet figured significantly in origin scenarios. No one yet knows how this
rich mix of organic compounds and dissolved minerals might influence the synthesis and assembly of biomolecules. But we’re poised to
find out.

ven as the debate between Miller’s advocates and the ventists was
heating up, an explosion of new research dramatically changed the
research community’s view of the emergence of biomolecules. When
Miller first reported organic synthesis on a benchtop in 1953, the results seemed almost magical. Fifty years ago, no one could have predicted how easy it would be to make amino acids, sugars, and other key
biomolecules from water and gas. But the more scientists study carbon
chemistry in a wide range of plausible, energetic prebiotic environments, the more diverse and facile organic synthesis seems to be. It
now appears that anywhere energy and simple carbon-rich molecules
are found together, a suite of interesting organic molecules is sure to
emerge. It’s all a matter of environment, and it now appears that the
universe boasts an extraordinary range of productive environments.
MOLECULES FROM DEEP SPACE

GENESIS

California, led by veteran astrochemist Louis Allamandola, has simulated the ultracold deep-space environments of these so-called dense
molecular clouds (though these vast volumes of dust and gas are far
less dense than the highest vacuum attainable on Earth). A typical interstellar cloud harbors only a measly million atoms per cubic inch, at
temperatures colder than –100°C. Such high vacuums and frigid temperatures would seem to preclude any sort of chemical reaction, but in
these remote regions, minute ice-covered dust particles are subjected
to ultraviolet radiation from distant stars. Gradually, as molecules absorb this radiation, they become sufficiently reactive to form larger
collections of atoms. Radio astronomers have long recognized the distinctive signatures of numerous organic species in these clouds. Each
type of molecule absorbs or emits characteristic wavelengths of light—
features that appear as sharp lines on a radio spectrum. The most abundant molecules are the diatomic and triatomic species, such as CO, H2,
CO2, and H2O, but more than 140 different compounds are known,
including many larger molecules with a dozen atoms or more.
Theorists easily explain such molecular diversity. They calculate
the efficiency with which small cold molecules condense onto tiny dust
particles, forming submicroscopic ice coatings. They predict details of
how icy particles occasionally absorb ultraviolet radiation, which can
shuffle electrons and trigger chemical reactions. They plot reaction cascades by which small groups of atoms clump together and slowly cause
new larger molecules to accumulate in the cloud. Eventually, under the
pervasive inward pull of gravity, local regions of a molecular cloud can
collapse into a new planetary system with a central massive star and an
array of planets and moons. As each body forms, a steady rain of
organic-rich comets and asteroids contributes to the life-forming inventory. So, the theorists tell us, organic molecules inevitably constitute part of any planet-forming mix.
Regardless of how convincing a theory may sound, experiments
carry a lot of weight in science. Allamandola and co-workers’ experiments at NASA Ames have exploited an elegant chilled vacuum chamber, about 8 inches in diameter, crafted of shiny stainless steel, and
equipped with thick glass observation ports, to produce suites of organic molecules. First, they introduce a fine spray of simple gas molecules, such as water, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia, into
the chamber, where the gases freeze onto an aluminum disk. Then they
bathe the thin ice layer with a beam of ultraviolet radiation, which

triggers the formation of larger molecules—compounds that match
the distinctive molecular emissions from those distant clouds.
[Plate 5]
The NASA team has used their benchtop apparatus to produce a
rich variety of interesting molecules: reactive nitriles, ethers, and
alcohols abound, as do ringlike hydrocarbons. One set of experiments
yielded nitrogen-bearing precursor molecules to amino acids. Another
set generated long chainlike molecules reminiscent of the building
blocks of cell membranes.
Evidence from space amply buttresses these nifty experiments. The
Murchison meteorite and many other carbon-rich meteorites are
loaded with organic molecules thought to be of extraterrestrial origin.
Comets, too, are known to be rich in the molecular precursors of life,
as are the microscopic interplanetary dust particles that incessantly
drift down to Earth’s surface. Armed with their vacuum chamber, the
Ames team can reproduce the supposed deep-space synthesis processes
in the lab. Theory, observations, and experiments agree: The prebiotic
Earth was seeded abundantly with extraterrestrial organics.
Nevertheless, the Miller crowd is unpersuaded by these studies,
too. Says Miller, “Organics from outer space, that’s garbage, it really is.”
Jeff Bada echoes, “Even if cosmic debris struck the prebiotic Earth at
10,000 times the present levels, the resultant prebiotic soup would still
have been much too weak to engender life.”
MOLECULES FROM GIANT IMPACTS
Meteorites and comets carry a rich inventory of organic molecules, but
can these molecules survive the catastrophic insults of collisions with
Earth? Deep-space synthesis, no matter how fecund, would be irrelevant to life’s origin if the intense temperatures and pressures of impact disintegrated molecules.
It’s hard to imagine an environment more destructive to life and
its molecules than the shattering surface impact of an asteroid or
comet. Nevertheless, carbon-rich meteorites like the Murchison contain a significant store of amino acids and other potential biomolecules; evidently impacts don’t destroy all organic molecules. In fact,
recent experiments suggest quite the opposite. Jennifer Blank and her
colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in Berkeley,
California, use a giant experimental gas gun that hurls hyperfast chunks

of metal at innocent rocks. Their goal is to trace the fates of organic
molecules during these violent collisions.
Blank’s experiments begin with a flattened cylindrical stainlesssteel capsule about 1 inch in diameter that is filled with a solution of
five different amino acids in water. She carefully positions the sealed
sample in a metal well—the target at the end of a 40-foot-long gun
barrel.
“Clear the room!” she demands, as they close the gun chamber.
A technician powers up her weapon. “Three, two, one, fire!” and
blam!, a tremendous shock wave shakes the building as a massive metal
projectile hurls down the barrel at more than 4,000 miles per hour and
squashes her neatly prepared sample like a bug. For a few microseconds, the amino acid solution experiences pressures in excess of
200,000 atmospheres at temperatures approaching 900°C.
Then the fun begins. Blank pries out her deformed steel capsule
and mills down the metal to extract a few drops of liquid. The original
clear solution has turned a dark brown color—something interesting
has happened to the amino acids. The organic chemists’ standard analytical techniques, chromatography and mass spectrometry, tell the
story. To be sure, most of the original amino acids are lost in every run.
But, remarkably, some of the delicate molecules react with each other
to form pairs of amino acids. The formation of these peptide bonds
between amino acids is a crucial step in the assembly of proteins.
Jennifer Blank’s highly publicized conclusion: Impacts on the early
Earth may have reduced the quantity of organic molecules, but at the
same time they increased the diversity of complex prebiotic chemical
species.
MOLECULES FROM HOT ROCKS
Of all scenarios for the prebiotic production of organic molecules,
none is more original (and correspondingly controversial) than the
idea of Friedemann Freund, a longtime researcher at the NASA Ames
Research Center. He claims that igneous rocks were, and still are, a

to Wes Huntress, the Geophysical Lab’s director, “the next chapter in
the origin of life is written in the solid state—in the dense, hard, seemingly hostile matrix of crystals.”

likely to meet, smiles and quietly presents his case. Tall, lean, with a
shock of graying hair, he speaks gently, with a slight German accent
and lots of eye contact. He’s always ready to talk about what he’s doing
and seldom expresses the slightest doubt that he’s onto something
important.
Here’s how he claims it happens. At high temperatures, every melt
contains some dissolved impurities. Molten rocks are no exception;
they always incorporate a little bit of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. As the melt cools, minerals begin to crystallize one after another.
The first mineral might be rich in magnesium, silicon, and oxygen, but
inevitably it will also incorporate a small amount of carbon and nitrogen—elements that don’t easily enter the crystal lattice. These residual
elements concentrate along crystal defects—zipperlike elongated
spaces where the foreign atoms can react and, according to Freund,
ultimately form chainlike molecules with a carbon backbone. Freund
suspects that every igneous rock has the potential to manufacture such
organic molecules. When the rocks weather away, so the story goes,
they release vast amounts of organic carbon into the environment.
Many scientists would say that’s a wacky idea. “I am a hundred
percent sure that the Freund paper is utter nonsense,” asserts Washington University mineralogist Anne Hofmeister. “Most igneous rocks
form from an incandescent melt at temperatures greater than
1,000°C—temperatures at which even the hardiest organic molecule is
fragmented into carbon dioxide and water. By contrast, organic contamination is everywhere in our environment.” What causes Freund’s
observed organics? “It’s surface residues,” Hofmeister says, “probably
sorbed out of the air.”
Freund rests his case on two sets of samples he has been studying
for almost a quarter century. Two-inch-long synthetic magnesium oxide (MgO) crystals, produced by cooling a white-hot MgO melt from
2,860°C, serve as a simple model system. Pure MgO should be clear
and colorless, but Freund’s crystals have a cloudy, turbid interior, suggestive of pervasive impurities. Infrared spectra reveal the sharp absorption features of carbon-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonding,
both characteristic of organic molecules. Studies of the crystals’ unusually high electrical conductivity and other anomalous properties
have further convinced him that the supposed MgO crystals are loaded
with excess carbon and hydrogen. The clincher: Subsequent analyses
of molecules extracted from crushed MgO crystals reveal the presence

of carboxylic acids, which just happen to be essential molecules in the
metabolism of all cells.
Studies of natural gem-quality olivine, an attractive green mineral
that is among the commonest constituents of igneous rocks, complement Freund’s work on synthetic MgO. Once again, his spectroscopic
studies revealed C–H and O–H bonds; once again, he extracted organic molecules from crushed powders. Olivine crystals hold an astonishing 100 parts per million carbon, he claims. Furthermore, much
of that carbon occurs in biologically interesting, chainlike organic
molecules.
Others remain unconvinced. Caltech mineralogist George
Rossman duplicated some of Freund’s olivine results with dirty crystals. “I ran a sample of ours that had been standing around for a while,”
he told Anne Hofmeister in 2002. “It had the organic bands. I washed it
off with organic solvent and re-ran it. No organic bands.” Organic contamination is everywhere, so any surface—especially any powder—no
matter how well cleaned, will quickly become loaded with adsorbed
organic molecules. Freund counters that the types of molecules he extracts, carboxylic acids, are not typical of any ordinary environmental
contamination. They must have come from inside the mineral.
Freund had won relatively few converts by the summer of 2003,
when he came to George Cody’s lab to duplicate his extraction of molecules from olivine. For several weeks, a white-coated Freund was an
amiable fixture at Cody’s lab bench. He meticulously washed and powdered the semiprecious stones, extracted carbon compounds with
strong solvents, and analyzed the samples with Cody’s battery of hightech instruments. Sure enough, every crystal seemed to release a small
hoard of carbon-rich molecules. There wasn’t much, certainly, but the
volume of igneous rock that has formed and eroded over the course of
geological history is immense. So, by Freund’s estimates, solid rocks
have provided one of Earth’s largest and most continuous sources for
the emergence of biomolecules.
Scientific progress involves a long process of hypothesis and testing, bold claims, and critical counterarguments. Not surprisingly,
Freund’s hypothesis has received a lot of scrutiny and not a little disdain. But those unexplained carboxylic acids can’t be ignored. And so,
for the time being, the jury is still out.

THE MULTIPLE-SOURCE HYPOTHESIS
Where did life’s crucial molecules form? In spite of the polarizing advocacy of one favored environment or another by this group and that,
experiments increasingly point to the possibility that there was no
single dominant source.
It’s not a matter of Millerites versus ventists, or deep space versus
Earth’s surface. Many ancient environments boasted carbon atoms and
sufficient energy to initiate their chemical transformations. Many
environments must have contributed to the prebiotic inventory.
Lightning-sparked gases were a major source, to be sure, as were UVtriggered reactions high in the atmosphere. Deep in the ocean, in environments ranging from lukewarm to boiling hot, molecules must
have been made in abundance, as they certainly were within some reactive rocks of the crust (and, if Tom Gold is correct, perhaps in the
much deeper mantle). A wealth of organic products also rained down
from space, formed in remote dense molecular clouds and concentrated in the carbon-rich meteorites and asteroids that coalesced to
make our planet.
The bottom line is that the prebiotic Earth had an embarrassment
of organic riches derived from many likely sources. Carbon-rich molecules emerge from every conceivable environment. Amino acids, sugars, hydrocarbons, bases—all the key molecular species are there.
So the real challenge turns out to be not so much the making of
molecules, but the selection of just the right ones and their assembly
into the useful structures we call macromolecules. That process required a higher level of emergence.

ll origin-of-life researchers face the baffling question of how the
biochemical complexity of modern living cells emerged from a
barren, primordial geochemical world. The only feasible approach is
to reduce biological complexity to a comprehensible sequence of chemistry experiments that can be tackled in the human dimensions of space
and time—a lab bench in a few weeks or months. George Cody, Hat
Yoder, and I were eager to continue our hydrothermal experiments,
but what should come next? We knew that the simplest living cell is
intricate beyond imagining, because every cell relies on the interplay
of millions of molecules engaged in hundreds of interdependent
chemical reactions. Human brains seem ill suited to grasp such multidimensional complexity.
Scientists have devised countless sophisticated chemical protocols,
and laboratories are overflowing with fancy analytical apparatus.
Chemists have learned to synthesize an astonishing array of paints,
glues, cosmetics, drugs, and a host of other useful products. Yet when
confronted with the question of life’s ancient origin, it’s easy to become mired in the scientific equivalent of writer’s block. How does
one begin to tackle the chemical complexity of life?
One approach to understanding life’s origin lies in reducing the
living cell to its simpler chemical components, the small carbon-based
molecules and the structures they form. We can begin by studying relatively simple systems and then work our way up to systems of greater
complexity. In such an endeavor, the fascinating new science of emergence points to a promising research strategy.

The Missing Law
It is unlikely that a topic as complicated as emergence will

definition.

ot coffee cools. Clean clothes get dirty. Colors fade. People age
and die. No one can escape the laws of thermodynamics.
Two great laws, both codified in the nineteenth century by a small
army of scientists and engineers, describe the behavior of energy. The
first law of thermodynamics establishes the conservation of energy.
Energy, which is a measure of a system’s ability to do work, comes in
many different forms: heat, light, kinetic energy, gravitational potential, and so forth. Energy can change from any one form to another
over and over again, but the total amount of energy does not change.
That’s the first law’s good news.
The bad news is that nature places severe limitations on how we
can use energy. The second law of thermodynamics states that heat
energy, for example, always flows from warmer to cooler regions, never
the other way, so the concentrated heat of a campfire or your car’s
engine gradually radiates away. That dissipated heat energy still exists,
but you can’t use it to do anything useful. By the same token, all natural systems tend spontaneously to become messier—they increase in
disorder, or “entropy.” So any collection of atoms—be it your shiny
new shoes or your supple young body—gradually deteriorates. The
second law of thermodynamics is more than a little depressing.
But look around you. You’ll find buildings, books, automobiles,
bees—all of them exquisitely ordered systems. Despite the second law’s

dictum that entropy increases, disorder is not the only end point in the
universe. Observations of such everyday phenomena as sand dunes,
seashells, and slime mold reveal that the two laws of thermodynamics
may not tell the entire story. Indeed, some scientists go so far as to
claim that a fundamental law of nature, the law describing the emergence of complex ordered systems (including every living cell), is missing from our textbooks.

Copyright   2005. Joseph Henry Press. All rights reserved.

THE LAWS OF NATURE
The discovery of a dozen or so natural laws represents the crowning
scientific achievement of the past four centuries. Newton’s laws of motion, the law of gravity, the laws of thermodynamics, and Maxwell’s
equations for electromagnetism collectively quantify the behavior of
matter, energy, forces, and motions in almost every human experience.
The power of these laws lies in their universality. Each law can be expressed as an equation that applies to an infinite number of events,
from the interactions of atoms to the formation of galaxies. Armed
with these laws, scientists and engineers confidently analyze almost any
physical system, from steam engines to stars.
So sweeping and inclusive are these natural laws that some scholars of the late nineteenth century suggested that the entire theoretical
framework of science had been deduced. All that remained to be discovered were relatively minor details, like filling in the few remaining
gaps in a stamp collection. Though this turned out not to be the case—
modern physics research has revealed new phenomena at the relativistic scales of the very small, the very fast, and the very massive—the
classic laws do indeed still hold sway in our everyday lives.
Yet in spite of centuries of labor by many thousands of scientists,
we do not fully understand one of nature’s most transforming phenomena—the emergence of complexity. Systems as a whole do tend to
become more disordered with time, but at the local scale of a cell, an
ant colony, or your conscious brain, remarkable complexity emerges.
In the 1970s, the Russian-born chemist Ilya Prigogine recognized that
these so-called complex emergent systems arise when energy flows
through a collection of many interacting particles. The arms of spiral
galaxies, the rings of Saturn, hurricanes, rainbows, sand dunes, life,
consciousness, cities, and symphonies all are ordered structures that
emerge when many interacting particles, or “agents”—be they mol-

ecules, stars, cells, or people—are subjected to a flow of energy. In the
jargon of thermodynamics, the formation of patterns in these systems
helps to speed up the dissipation of energy as mandated by the second
law. Scientists and nonscientists alike tend to value the surprising order and novelty of such emergent systems.
The recognition and description of such emergent systems provides a foundation for origin-of-life research, for life is the quintessential emergent phenomenon. From lifeless molecules emerged the first
living cell. If we can understand the principles governing such systems,
we may be able to apply those insights to our experimental programs.

DESCRIBING EMERGENT SYSTEMS
If you want to enunciate a law that characterizes emergent systems,
then the first step is to examine everyday examples. You can observe
emergent behavior in countless systems all around us, including the
interactions of atoms, or of automobiles, or of ants. This universal
tendency for systems to display increased order when lots of objects
interact, while fully consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, is not addressed explicitly in either of those laws. We
have yet to discover if all emergent systems possess a unifying mathematical behavior, though our present ignorance should not seem too
unsettling. It took more than a half-century for each of the first two
laws of thermodynamics—describing the behavior of energy and entropy, respectively—to develop from qualitative ideas into quantitative laws. I suspect that a mathematical formulation of emergence will
be discovered much sooner than that, perhaps within the next decade
or two.
Scientists have already identified key aspects of the problem. Many
familiar natural systems lie close to equilibrium—that is, they are stable
and unchanging—and thus they do not display emergent behavior.
Water gradually cooled to below the freezing point equilibrates to become a clear chunk of ice. Water gradually heated above the boiling
point similarly equilibrates by converting to steam. For centuries, scientists have documented such equilibrium processes in countless carefully controlled scientific studies.
Away from equilibrium, dramatically different behavior occurs.
Rapidly boiling water, for example, displays complex, turbulent convection. Water flowing downhill in the gravitational gradient of a river

valley interacts with sediments to produce the emergent landform patterns of braided streams, meandering rivers, sandbars, and deltas.
These patterns arise as energetic water moves.
Emergent systems seem to share this common characteristic: They
arise away from equilibrium when energy flows through a collection of
many interacting particles. Such systems of agents tend spontaneously
to become more ordered and to display new, often surprising behaviors. And as patterns arise, energy is dissipated more efficiently, in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. Ultimately, the resulting
behavior appears to be much more than the sum of the parts.
Emergent patterns in water and sand may seem a far cry from living organisms, but for scientists studying life’s origins there’s a big payoff in understanding such simple systems: Of all known emergent
phenomena, none is more dramatic than life, so studies of simpler
emergence can provide a conceptual basis, a jumping-off point, for
origin-of-life research.

QUANTIFYING THE COMPLEXITY OF
EMERGENT SYSTEMS
Even though emergent systems surround us, a rigorous definition
(much less a precise mathematical formulation) remains elusive. If we
are to discover a natural law that describes the behavior of emergent
systems, then we must first identify the essential properties of such
systems. But what characteristics distinguish emergent systems from
other less interesting collections of interacting objects?
All emergent systems display the rather subjective characteristic of
“complexity”—a property that thus far lacks a precise quantitative definition. In a colloquial sense, a complex system has an intricate or patterned structure, as in a complex piece of machinery or a Bach fugue.
“Complexity” may also refer to information content: An advanced textbook contains more detailed information, and is thus more complex,
than an elementary one. In this sense, the interactions of ants in an ant
colony or neurons in the human brain are vastly more complex than
the behavior of a pile of sand or a box of Cheerios.
Such complexity is the hallmark of every emergent system. What
scientists hope to find, therefore, is an equation that relates the properties of a system on the one hand (its temperature or pressure, for example, expressed in numbers), to the resultant complexity of the

system (also expressed as a number) on the other. Such an equation
would in fact be the missing “law of emergence.” But before that is
possible we need an unambiguous, quantitative definition of the complexity of a physical system. How to proceed?
A small band of scientists, many of them associated with the Santa
Fe Institute in New Mexico, have thought long and hard about complex systems and ways to model them mathematically. But their efforts
yield surprisingly diverse (some would say divergent) views on how to
approach the subject.
John Holland, an ace at computer algorithms and a revered
founder of the field of emergence, models emergent systems as computer programs with a fixed set of operating instructions. He suspects
that any emergent phenomenon, including sand ripples, ant colonies,
the conscious brain, and more, can be reduced to a set of selection
rules. Holland and his followers have made great strides in mimicking
natural phenomena with a few lines of computer code. Indeed, for
Holland and his followers the complexity of a system is closely related
to the minimum number of lines of computer code required to mimic
that system’s behavior.
A delightful example of this approach is BOIDS, a simple program
written by California programmer Craig Reynolds that duplicates the
movements of flocking birds, schooling fish, swarming insects, and
other collective animal behaviors with astonishing accuracy. (To check
it out on the Internet, just Google “BOIDS.”) Lest you think that this
effort is idle play, remember that computer programmers of video
games and Hollywood special effects have made a bundle on this type
of simulated emergent behavior. Think of BOIDS the next time you
watch dinosaur herds on the run in Jurassic Park, swarming locusts in
The Mummy, or schools of fish in Finding Nemo.
Physicist Stephen Wolfram, a mathematical prodigy who made
millions in his twenties from the elegant, indispensable computer package Mathematica, provides a complementary vision of emergent complexity from simple rules. Like Holland, Wolfram was captivated by
the power of simple instructions to generate complex visual patterns.
Sensing a new paradigm for the description and analysis of the natural
world, he has spent the past 20 years developing what he calls “a new
kind of science” (NKS for short). A mammoth tome by that title published in 2002 and an elaborate Web site (www.wolframscience.com)
illustrate some of the stunning ways whereby geometric complexity

may arise from simple rules. Perhaps, Wolfram argues, the complex
evolution of the physical universe and all it contains can be modeled as
a set of sequential instructions.
Many other ways to view complex systems have been proposed.
The late Danish physicist Per Bak described complex systems in terms
of a mathematical characteristic called “self-criticality.” These systems
evolve by repeatedly achieving a critical point at which they falter and
regroup, like a growing pile of sand that avalanches over and over again
as new grains are added. Santa Fe theorist Stuart Kauffman proposes
another tack, focusing on the emergence of chemical complexity via
competitive “autocatalytic networks,” by which collections of chemical compounds catalyze their own formation. And Nobel laureate
Murray Gell-Mann, who also works at the Santa Fe Institute, has recently introduced a new parameter he calls “nonextensive entropy”—
a measure of the intrinsic complexity of a system—as a path to
understanding complex systems.
All these approaches and more inform the search for a law of emergence; all provide a glimpse of the answer. Yet each seems too abstract
to apply to benchtop chemical experiments on the origin of life. An
experimentalist needs to decide on the nitty-gritty details: What should
be the starting chemicals at what concentrations; how acidic or basic
the solution; what run temperatures, pressures, and times? Is there any
way that the ideas of emergence can help?
A classic scientific approach to discovering general principles and
laws is to examine the behavior of specific systems. The study of simple
systems that display emergent behavior may well point to physical factors that lead to patterning in much more complex systems, including
life. We can hope that observations of specific systems will eventually
point to more general rules.
PATTERNS IN THE SAND
You don’t need a laboratory to observe emergent phenomena. In fact,
you can’t go on a hike without seeing dozens of examples of emergence in action. Among my favorite emergent phenomena are interactions of water and sand, which provide a convenient and comprehensible example of structures arising from the energetic interactions
of lots of agents (not to mention a great excuse to spend the day at the
shore). When moving water (or wind, for that matter) flows across a

flat layer of sand, new patterns arise. Periodic sand ripples appear, as
sand grains are sorted by size, shape, and density. The system thus
becomes more orderly and patterned as energy—the flow of wind or
water—dissipates.
My favorite emergent sandy system lies at the base of the fossilrich hundred-foot-tall cliffs that border the Chesapeake Bay’s western
shore in Calvert County, Maryland. Fifteen-million-year-old whale
bones, razor-sharp sharks’ teeth, branching bleached corals, and robust fist-sized clamshells abound in the wash zone, where waves constantly wear away the soft sediments. Walks along those majestic
formations often lead to thoughts about the factors that contribute to
complexity.
At times of unusually low tide, especially near a new moon in the
cold clear winter months, receding waters expose a gently sloping pavement of ancient sediments below the base of the cliff—a formation
called blue marl. Treacherously slippery when wet, this firm flat surface commonly accumulates a thin layer of sand—particles that display emergent patterns when subjected to the wash of shallow water.
Over the years, I’ve noticed four distinct factors that contribute to the
emergence of complex sand patterning.

Copyright   2005. Joseph Henry Press. All rights reserved.

Factor 1: The Concentration of Agents
The first obvious factor in achieving a patterned, complex system is
simply the density of sand grains—that is, the number of interacting
particles per square centimeter of the blue marl’s surface. It’s easy to
estimate this number by collecting almost every grain of sand from an
area 10 centimeters square, about the size of a small paper napkin. I
collect the sand in a plastic bag or bottle, take it back to the lab, dry it,
and weigh the sample. Using a microscope, I count out 100 grains from
the sample and then weigh that batch. As it turns out, the total number
of grains per square centimeter is approximately equal to the total
weight of sand from the 100 square-centimeter (10 × 10) area divided
by the weight of 100 sand grains.
I find that with fewer than about 100 sand grains per square centimeter, the dusting of particles is too sparse for any noticeable patterns
to emerge. Given the minute size of the average sand grain, typically
less than half a millimeter in diameter, 100 grains per square centimeter provides a sparse coverage over less than 10 percent of the smooth

Patterns in sand grains emerge as the concentration of grains increases. At about a

a few thousand grains per square centimeter (B) discontinuous bands arise; and

blue marl surface. Increase the sand concentration to about 1,000
grains per square centimeter, however, and an intriguing pattern of
regularly spaced sand piles, each a centimeter or two across, appears
on the hard blue surface. What’s more, a small circle of darker sand
grains typically crowns each little tan pile. Evidently a minimum concentration of several hundred grains per square centimeter is required
to initiate patterning in sand.
Increase the sand concentration slightly to a few thousand grains
per square centimeter and you get discontinuous short bands of sand
at right angles to the gentle back-and-forth wave motion of the shallow water. As with the mini-sandpiles, each tan band is topped by a
line of darker grains. And as sand concentration exceeds 10,000 grains
per square centimeter, continuous, evenly spaced, black-capped ripples
form across the hard pavement. I’ve seen this classic rippled surface
cover hundreds of square meters of shallow water in patterns so hypnotically regular that I hesitated to disturb the symmetry by walking
on it.

THE MISSING LAW

19

And that’s it. Higher concentrations of sand simply provide a
deeper base for the regular ripples. Buried sand grains don’t participate in the process so no new structures arise beyond the elegant, wavelike, periodic forms on the surface.
This systematic behavior suggests that the concentration of interacting agents plays a fundamental role in the emergent complexity of a
system. Below a critical threshold, no patterns are seen. As particle concentrations increase, so too does complexity, but only to a point. Above
a critical saturation of agents, we find no new behaviors.
Similar observations have been made about other emergent systems. One ant species—Eciton burchelli, the army ant—stays close to
home as long as the colony consists of fewer than about 80,000 individuals. Exceed that number of army ants, however, and the colony
exhibits new emergent behavior; like a bursting dam, the ants pour out
in a massive “swarm raid” to attack adjacent colonies. At higher populations, half of the ants may spontaneously leave to form a new colony.
Studies of termite colonies also reveal that the construction of pillartype mounds requires a critical density of individuals.
At a much greater scale, spiral galaxies require a minimum number of about 100 million stars to trigger development of the familiar
spiral arm structure. According to theoretical models of astrophysicists, the majestic arms form as a result of gravitational instabilities
caused in part by a large central mass of stars.
Human consciousness and self-awareness also emerge from the
interactions of trillions of neurons. Sadly, as those of us who watch
friends and relatives afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease must observe,
when a critical number of cells and their connections are destroyed,
self-awareness fades away.
These findings suggest that the emergence of life might have depended on achieving some minimal concentration of biomolecules,
the essential agents of cellular life. Too few molecules, no matter how
friendly the environment, and life could not arise. That’s a useful idea
to bear in mind when designing origin-of-life experiments.
Factor 2: The Interconnectivity of Agents
Sand grains influence each other by direct contact, the simplest local
way to interact. A rounded grain at the surface of a sandpile typically
touches about a half-dozen adjacent grains. The balance between these

GENESIS

stabilizing contacts and gravity on the one hand, and the restless, disruptive flow of water on the other, leads to a controlled shuffling of
grains and ultimately to the rippled patterning of sand. By contrast,
ants in an ant colony interact over much greater distances, by marking
the ground with a variety of pheromones, which are chemical signals
that point other ants to food, alert them to danger, and provide other
vital information. In this way, any given ant has the potential to interact with thousands of colony mates in varied ways. These differences
in interconnectedness provide part of the reason why ant colonies are
more complex than water-shaped sandpiles.
The conscious brain, the most complex system we know, is also
the most complexly interconnected. Each of the trillions of neurons in
your brain interacts with hundreds of other nearby cells through a
branching network of dendrites. Electrical signals between any two
neurons, furthermore, may be stronger or weaker, like the current controlled by the dimmer switch on your lamp. Interconnections of the
brain are vastly more intricate than those of sand or ants.
These observations of emergent systems suggest that life’s origin
must have relied on a wide repertoire of chemical interactions. Experiments that optimize the number and type of molecular contacts might
thus be more likely to display emergent behaviors of interest.

Factor 3: Energy Flow Through the System
Regardless of how many sand grains or ants or neurons are present, no
pattern can emerge without a flow of energy through the system. Sand
grains will not start hopping without a certain minimum water-wave
speed (typically about 1/2 to 1 meter per second along the shores of the
Chesapeake Bay). More energetic waves with greater speed and amplitude move grains more easily and generate sand patterns more quickly,
though these patterns do not appear to differ fundamentally in their
shapes.
But every complex patterned system has a limit to the magnitude
of energy flow it can tolerate. During energetic storms, crashing waves
obliterate sand ripples and other local sedimentary features. Black and
tan sand grains become jumbled and all signs of emergent patterning
disappear.
The human brain exhibits strikingly similar behavior in terms of
energy flow. During normal waking hours, the brain maintains a mod-

erate level of electrical impulses—the normal healthy flow of energy
through the neural system. Deepest sleep corresponds to a sharp drop
in electrical activity as we slip from consciousness, whereas the excessive electrical intensity of an epileptic seizure thwarts conscious action
by scrambling the usual patterned electrical flow.
The emergence of complex patterns evidently requires energy flow
within rather restrictive limits: Too little flow and nothing happens;
too much flow and the system is randomized—entropy triumphs. This
conclusion is important for the experimental study of life’s chemical
origins. A reliable source of energy is essential, to be sure, but lightning, ultraviolet radiation, and other intense forms of ionizing energy
can blast molecules apart and may be too extreme to jump-start life.
We must look for gentler chemical energy sources, like the steady, reliable chemical potential energy stored in a flashlight battery, to sustain
the metabolism of primitive life.

Factor 4: Cycling of Energy Flow
Many natural systems are subject to cycles of energy: day and night,
summer and winter, high tide and low tide. Such cycles may play a
fundamental role in the evolution of emergent systems, though it’s often difficult to document the effects of these subtle cycles in nature.
Laboratory wave tanks, though considerably less scenic than the
Chesapeake Bay in January, facilitate the study of sand-ripple formation under controlled conditions. Recent research on natural patterned
systems reveals that cycling of energy flow through a system is a fascinating and previously unrecognized fourth factor in generating complex sand patterns. In 2001, physicist Jonas Lundbek Hansen at the
Niels Bohr Institute and his Danish colleagues announced this surprising wrinkle in the mechanics of ripple formation. Most previous experiments had involved fixed wave amplitudes (that is, wave height)
and frequencies (how many waves pass a given point in a second). Such
studies typically generate perfectly spaced, straight ripples. Instead,
Hansen and his colleagues wondered what might happen if they cycled
these variables. Over periods of several minutes, they increased and
then decreased the amplitude or the frequency of their water waves.
The results were breathtaking. Rather than simple parallel sand ripples,
they produced elegant intertwined and branching sand structures.
These new patterns appear remarkably similar to sand features that

commonly arise along the Chesapeake Bay when the water is only a
few inches deep—conditions that apparently favor periodic fluctuations in wave amplitude.
Alert to the potential power of energy cycling, PhD student Mark
Kessler and Professor Brad Werner of the University of California, San
Diego, recently analyzed amazing stone circles and other so-called “patterned grounds” in Alaskan Arctic terrain that is subject to cyclical
freezing and thawing. With each thaw, rounded boulders shift slightly,
interacting with one another over many years to produce remarkable
fields covered by natural circles of stone. [Plate 2]
The role of cycling in the emergence of patterns represents a frontier area of study that is keenly watched by some origin-of-life investigators. After all, the primitive Earth was subject to many cycles—
day/night, high tide/low tide, wet/dry, and more. Perhaps such cycles,
which can be duplicated in a controlled experimental environment,
contributed to the emergence of life itself.
FORMULATING EMERGENCE
So what might a mathematical law of emergence look like? My guess is
that the expression will take the form of a mathematical inequality,
something like this:

Copyright   2005. Joseph Henry Press. All rights reserved.

C ≤ f[n,i,∇E(t)]
That’s a short-hand way of saying that the emergent complexity of
a system, denoted by the letter C (for “complexity”), is a number less
than or equal to some value that is a mathematical function (f) of the
concentration of interacting particles (n), the degree of those particles’
interconnectivity (i), the time-varying energy flow through the system
[∇E(t)], and perhaps other variables as well.
At least two daunting impediments thwart the completion of this
potentially simple formulation. First, as previously noted, we lack a
precise definition of complexity. It’s impossible to quantify something
when you don’t really know what that something is. And second, we
are woefully ignorant of the exact mathematical relationships between
complexity and the three possible key factors: the concentration of interacting agents, the interconnectivity of those agents, and the cyclical

This quest to characterize emergent phenomena, though initially
couched in mathematical abstraction, is not ultimately an abstract exercise. Emergent systems frame every aspect of our experience. Our
environment, our bodies, our minds, the patterns of our lives and our
culture—all display emergent complexity. A comprehensive theory of
emergence will foster applications to myriad problems in everyday
technology: long-range weather prediction, computer network design,
traffic control, the stabilization of ecosystems, the control of epidemics, perhaps even the prevention of war. Armed with such a law, we will
acquire a deeper understanding of any system of many interacting
agents—indeed, even of the origin of life itself.

What Is Life?
I know it when I see it.
Justice Potter Stewart, 1964

A

recent origin-of-life text features an appendix with scientific definitions of life written by 48 different authorities. The entry contributed by the distinguished evolutionary biologist John Maynard
Smith describes life as “any population of entities which has the properties of multiplication, heredity and variation.” Alternatively, information theorist Stuart Kauffman claims that “life is an expected,
collectively self-organized property of catalytic polymers.” Other
equally renowned experts propose that “Life is the ability to communicate,” “Life is a flow of energy, matter and information,” “Life is a selfsustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian
evolution.” The definitions go on and on. Remarkably, no two definitions are the same.
This lack of agreement represents an obvious problem for those
who search for signs of living organisms on other worlds, as well as for
origin-of-life researchers. It is difficult to be sure that you’ve discovered life—or deduced the process of life’s origin, for that matter—when
you can’t define what it is. In spite of generations of work by hundreds
of thousands of biologists, in spite of countless studies of living organisms at every scale from molecules to continents, we still have no widely
accepted definition.
This frustrating lack is not particularly surprising. For one thing,
the question “What is life?” is asked in different contexts by different
professions. Theologians hotly debate it in relation to the beginning of
human life. Does life start at the moment of conception, when the fetal

brain first responds, or when the unborn heart first beats? In some
theologies, life commences not with a physical process, but at the unknowable supposed instant of ensoulment. At the other end of the human journey, doctors and lawyers require a definition of life in order
to deal ethically with patients who are brain dead or otherwise terminally unresponsive.
In contrast to these ethically complex and emotionally charged issues are the more abstract scientific efforts to define life. Biologists rely
on straightforward genetic analysis—tests for DNA or diagnostic proteins—to identify the presence of life-forms on Earth today. But a more
general definition that distinguishes all imaginable living objects from
the myriad nonliving ones remains elusive. We know relatively little
about the diversity of cellular life on Earth, not to mention the vast
range of plausible noncellular life-forms that might await discovery
elsewhere in the universe. Endorsing a sweeping definition of life based
on such scanty knowledge is akin to defining “music” after listening to
a single recording of Bach’s solo cello suites over and over again. The
suites are a sublime example of music, but hardly sufficient to characterize the entire genre.

“TOP-DOWN” VERSUS “BOTTOM-UP”
Scientists crave an unambiguous definition of life, and they adopt two
complementary approaches in their efforts to distinguish that which is
alive from that which is not. Many scientists adopt the “top-down”
approach. They scrutinize all manner of unambiguous living and fossil
organisms to identify the most primitive entities that are, or were, alive.
For origin-of-life researchers, primitive microbes and ancient microfossils have the potential to provide relevant clues about life’s early
chemistry. This strategy is limited, however, because all known lifeforms, whether living or fossil, are based on biochemically sophisticated cells containing DNA and proteins. Any definition of life based
on top-down research is correspondingly limited.
By contrast, a small army of investigators pursues the so-called
“bottom-up” approach. They devise laboratory experiments to mimic
the emergent chemistry of ancient Earth environments. Eventually, the
bottom-up goal is to create a living chemical system in the laboratory
from scratch—an effort that might clarify the transition from nonlife
to life. Such research leads to an amusing range of passionate opinions

regarding what is alive, because each scientist tends to define life in
terms of his or her own chosen specialty. One group will focus on the
origin of cell membranes; to them, life began when the first encapsulating membrane appeared. Another team studies the emergence of
metabolic cycles, so naturally for them the origin of life coincided with
the origin of metabolism. Still other groups investigate primordial
RNA (DNA’s presumed precursor genetic material), viruses, or even
artificial intelligence, and each group hawks its own definition of life’s
first appearance.
Into this mix, philosophers and theologians inject a more abstract
view and speculate on the full range of phenomena that might be said
to be alive—robotic life, computer life, even a self-aware Internet. Such
debates can at times sound like a science fiction convention, but defining life is no idle exercise. The scientific community, with the full support of NASA and other governmental agencies, holds regular meetings
to debate the question. After all, one of NASA’s prime missions is to
look for life on other worlds, so a clear definition is essential for planning future missions.
It’s amazing how the “What is life?” question sparks arguments
and fosters hard-line positions. Scientists excel at many things, but
compromise is not always one of them. Nevertheless, Gerald Joyce of
The Scripps Research Institute, serving on a NASA Exobiology panel,
proposed a widely cited “working definition” for life in the context of
space exploration. “Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of
undergoing Darwinian evolution,” he suggested.
According to this opinion, life combines three distinctive characteristics. First, any form of life must be a chemical system. Computer
programs, robots activated with microchips, or other electronic entities are not alive according to this definition. Life also grows and sustains itself by gathering energy and atoms from its surroundings—the
essence of metabolism. Finally, living entities must display variation.
Natural selection of the more fit individuals will inevitably lead to evolution and the emergence of more complex entities. This NASAinspired definition is probably as general, useful, and concise as any we
are likely to come up with—at least until we discover more about what
is actually out there.
Even armed with this functional definition, it’s difficult to know
what Earth’s very first life-form was like. Our planet’s earliest life may
have been vastly different from anything we know today. Many experts

suspect that the first living entity was not a single isolated cell as we
know it, for even the simplest cell incorporates astonishing chemical
complexity. That first life-form probably did not use DNA, given the
exceedingly intricate genetic mechanism of life on Earth today. It may
not even have used proteins, the chemical workhorses of cellular life.
Experts in different fields propose different ideas regarding Earth’s
first life-form. As a geologist, trained in the ways of rocks, my favorite
theory is that the very first entity to fit NASA’s trial definition may have
been an extremely thin molecular coating on rock surfaces. Such “flat
life” would have spread across mineral grains in a layer only a few billionths of a meter thick, exploiting energy-rich mineral surfaces while
slowly spreading like a lichen from rock to rock.
Whatever the first life-form looked like, it must have arisen from
chemical reactions of ocean, atmosphere, and rocks. Yet the overarching problem with studying life’s origin is that even the simplest known
life-form is vastly more complex than any nonliving components that
might have contributed to it. How does such astonishing, intricate
complexity arise from lifeless raw materials? Emergence can help.

ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE
French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who investigated the mythologies of many cultures, identified a deep-seated human tendency
to reduce complex situations to oversimplified dichotomies: friend and
enemy, heaven and hell, good and evil. The history of science reveals
that scientists are in no way immune to this mindset. In the eighteenth
century, the neptunists, who favored a watery origin for rocks, fought
with the plutonists, who favored heat as the causative agent. Both, it
turns out, were right. A similar contentious and ultimately misleading
dichotomy raged between the eighteenth-century catastrophists and
uniformitarians, the former espousing a brief and cataclysmic geological history for Earth and the latter holding that geological processes are
gradual and ongoing. Once-doctrinal distinctions between plants and
animals or between single-celled and multicellular organisms have become similarly blurred.
Attempts to formulate an absolute definition that distinguishes
between life and nonlife represents a similar false dichotomy. Here’s
why. The first cell did not just appear, fully formed with all its chemical
sophistication and genetic machinery. Rather, life must have arisen

through a sequence of emergent events—diverse processes of organic
synthesis, followed by molecular selection, concentration, encapsulation, and organization into diverse molecular structures. The emergence of self-replicating molecules of increasing complexity and
mutability led to molecular evolution through the process of natural
selection, driven by competition for limited raw materials. That sequential process is an organizing theme of this book.
What appears to us as a yawning divide between nonlife and life
obscures the fact that the chemical evolution of life occurred in this
stepwise sequence of successively more complex stages of emergence.
When modern cells emerged, they quickly consumed virtually all traces
of the earlier stages of chemical evolution. “Protolife” became a rich
source of food, wiped clean by the consuming cellular life, like a clever
murderer leaving the scene of the crime.
Our challenge, then, is to play detective—to establish a progressive
hierarchy of emergent steps leading from a prebiotic Earth enriched in
organic molecules, to functional clusters of molecules perhaps arranged on a mineral surface, to self-replicating molecular systems that
copy themselves using resources in their immediate environment, to
encapsulation in membranes—that is, to cellular life. (Recall the words
of Harold Morowitz: “The unfolding of life involves many, many
emergences.”) The nature and sequence of these steps may vary in different environments, and we may never know the exact sequence (or
sequences) that occurred on the early Earth. Yet many of us suspect
that the inexorable direction of the chemical path is similar on any
habitable planet or moon.
Such a stepwise scenario informs attempts to define life. To define
the exact point at which such a system of gradually increasing complexity becomes “alive” is intrinsically arbitrary. Where you, or I, or
anyone else chooses to draw such a line is more a question of perceived
value than of science. Do you value the intrinsic isolation of each
living thing? Then for you, life’s origin may correspond to the entrapment of chemicals by a flexible cell-like membrane. Or is reproduction—the extraordinary ability of one creature to become two and
more—your thing. Then self-replication becomes the demarcation
point. Many scientists value information as the key and argue that life
began with a genetic mechanism that passed information from one
generation to the next.

GENESIS

“What is life?” is fundamentally a semantic question, a subjective
matter of taxonomy. Nature holds a rich variety of complex, emergent
chemical systems, and scientists increasingly are learning to craft such
systems in the laboratory. No matter how curious or novel their behavior, none of these systems comes with an unambiguous label: “life” or
“nonlife.”
To be sure, labels are important and scientists convene earnest conferences and appoint august committees to decide on taxonomic issues. Valid taxonomy is vital for effective communication and provides
a foundation for any scientific pursuit. The problem facing us today,
however, is that valid taxonomies rely on a minimum level of understanding. Early attempts at classifying animals purely by color, shape,
or other superficial features ultimately failed. Similarly, the classification of chemical elements by their physical state—solid, liquid, or gas—
was unhelpful in developing a predictive chemical theory.
Recently, the philosopher Carol Cleland of the University of Colorado and the planetary scientist Christopher Chyba of the SETI (Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute compared current attempts
to define life with similar eighteenth-century efforts to characterize
water. Before the discovery of molecules and atomic theory, water could
be characterized only by a series of non-unique traits. Water is clear
and wet, but so are many oils (and muddy water isn’t all that clear).
Water sustains life, but so do many foods (and water with a few invisible pathogens can kill you). Water freezes when it gets cold, water soaks
into wood, water flows downhill, on and on the list grows; but none of
these traits, nor any combination of these traits, is both necessary and
sufficient. No definition devised in the eighteenth century could have
captured the true essence of water—the molecule with two hydrogen
atoms and one oxygen atom.
By the same token, they argue, scientists in the early twenty-first
century are in no position to define life. We have yet to articulate the
theoretical underpinnings of biology; we have nothing analogous to
the periodic table for living entities. And with only one unambiguous
example, cellular life on Earth, we are in no position to lock ourselves
into any precise definition. Better, therefore, to keep an open mind and
simply describe the characteristics of whatever we find.
I suspect that any universal theory of life will rest, at least in part,
on the ideas of emergence. If life arose as a sequence of emergent steps,
then each of those steps represents a taxonomically distinct, funda-

mentally important stage in life’s molecular synthesis and organization. Each step deserves its own label.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY
Ultimately, the key to defining the progressive stages between nonlife
and life lies in experimental studies of relevant chemical systems under
plausible geochemical environments. The concept of emergence simplifies this experimental endeavor by reducing an immensely complex
historical process to a more comprehensible succession of measurable
steps. Each emergent step provides a tempting focus for laboratory experimentation and theoretical modeling.
This nontraditional view of life’s definition as a stepwise transition from chemistry to biology is of special relevance to the search for
life elsewhere in the universe. It’s plausible, for example, that Mars,
Europa, and other bodies in our solar system progressed only part way
along the path to cellular life. If so, that’s crucial to know, at least from
NASA’s point of view. If each step in life’s origin produced distinctive
and measurable isotopic, molecular, and structural signatures in its
environment, and if such markers can be identified, then these chemical features become observational targets for planned space missions.
It’s possible, for example, that primitive prebiotic isotopic, molecular,
and structural forms are inevitably eaten by more advanced cells
and survive as “fossils” only if cellular life never developed in their
environs. Thus prebiotic features may serve as extraterrestrial “abiomarkers”—clear evidence that molecular organization and evolution
never progressed beyond a certain precellular stage. As scientists search
for life elsewhere in the universe, they may be able to characterize extraterrestrial environments according to their degree of emergence
along this multistep path.
Consider Saturn’s recently visited moon Titan as a choice example.
Cloud-enshrouded Titan possesses an atmosphere one-and-a-half
times thicker than Earth’s and is rich in methane and ammonia. Organic molecules, which color the atmosphere a hazy orange, rain onto
the surface to form thick accumulations of organic gunk. Lakes of
methane and ethane occur side-by-side with frozen expanses of rockhard water ice, though conditions are generally much too cold for liquid water or significant chemical progress toward life.
From time to time, however, the impact of a large comet or aster-

oid may have melted regions of ice on Titan. For periods of hundreds
or even thousands of years, gradually cooling ice-covered lakes might
have supported the first chemical steps in the path toward life, only to
become frozen again. Such primitive biochemistry, though lost forever
on Earth’s scavenged surface, might conceivably survive in the deepfreeze of Titan.
But so much for speculation and conjecture. Observations of the
living world, coupled with relevant experiments, will illuminate the
emergence of life both here on Earth and even elsewhere in our solar
system.

he profound difficulty in crafting an unambiguous definition of
what is (or was) alive came into dramatic focus in 1996 with the
discovery of supposed cellular fossils in a meteorite from Mars. Of
the countless thousands of meteorites that have been collected on
Earth’s surface, only a precious two dozen or so came to us from Mars.
In the 1980s, chemists deduced the distant origins of these rocks from
the diagnostic composition of gas trapped inside them—gas that
matches perfectly the known idiosyncrasies of the Martian atmosphere.
Theorists maintained that giant asteroid impacts on Mars could easily
have hurled rocky debris into orbit around the Sun. And while the Sun
and Jupiter, the two most massive objects in our solar system, eventually (often after millions of years) sweep up most of that Martian detritus,
a tiny fraction of the rubble inevitably finds its way to Earth. With the
discovery of Martian meteorites, scientists could, for the first time,
investigate actual pieces of another planet.
Naturally, these nondescript chunks of dark-colored rock are
highly prized and receive the closest examination by earthbound scientists. Most of them are hunks of ancient igneous formations—material formed from once-molten rock near the Martian surface. We
expect such meteorites to be devoid of life. But one Mars meteorite
proved strikingly different from the others, and it naturally attracted
extra close scrutiny. Collected in 1984 from the Allan Hills region of
Antarctica (hence its now famous designation, ALH84001), this mete33

orite held a suite of minerals that suggested to some scientists the possibility of ancient interactions with liquid water.
A team of biologists, planetary scientists, and meteorite experts
led by NASA’s David McKay subjected pieces of the two-pound rock to
a battery of analytical tests. They probed the meteorite with X-rays,
lasers, gamma rays, and beams of electrons, recording characteristics
as small as a billionth of an inch across. No one had ever expected to
find hard evidence for Martian life, but even a hint of freely flowing
water on Mars would constitute a major discovery. Yet gradually, as the
data piled up, McKay and his colleagues began to believe that they had
found the smoking gun for Martian life.

LIFE ON MARS: THE ALLAN HILLS STORY
On August 7, 1996, the Allan Hills team publicly claimed the discovery
of tiny elongated objects that were once alive. “LIFE ON MARS!”
screamed the headlines, while the prestigious periodical Science published an article with the equally giddy title (at least for a scientific
journal), “Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible relic biogenic activity
in Martian meteorite ALH84001.” President Clinton got into the act by
holding a national press conference, during which he basked in the
reflected glory of NASA’s triumph.
McKay and his eight co-workers pointed to five separate types of
data, which they presented point by point like a zealous prosecutor at a
jury trial. Point number one: The meteorite was found to contain a
suite of organic molecules, including carbon-based compounds called
PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). These sturdy, long-lasting
molecules, which feature interlocking rings of six carbon atoms, often
arise when once-living cells are subjected to high temperature. Since
carbon is the key element of life as we know it, its presence in
ALH84001, which distinguished that specimen from the other Martian meteorites, was of extraordinary significance.
Point two: The meteorite held microscopic globules of carbonate
minerals, similar to those that make the graceful formations on the
walls of caves on Earth. Such carbonates are often deposited through
the action of liquid water passing through a system of cracks and fissures. Liquid water is the presumptive medium of all cells and thus a
necessary condition for life. What’s more, their tiny structures, about a

ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter, reminded some observers of
minerals precipitated by microbes on Earth.
The third and fourth points relied on sophisticated analytical
tools. The NASA team used an electron microscope to discover and
characterize two iron-bearing minerals, an iron sulfide called pyrrhotite and an iron oxide called magnetite. Of particular interest were the
curious chainlike arrays of minuscule magnetite crystals. Magnetite is
a magnetic mineral found in abundance in rocks of all types, but the
perfect shape of these alien crystals and their unusual chemical purity,
coupled with their distinctive linear arrangements, seemed unlike anything ever seen except in a few remarkable types of bacteria. These
“magnetotactic” microbes tend to live in thin layers of sediment where
chemical conditions change rapidly with depth, and they use their internal magnets to distinguish “up” from “down,” by sensing the inclination of Earth’s magnetic field. So sensitive are these organisms to
their vertical position that magnetotactic bacteria from the Northern
Hemisphere move in the wrong direction and die when placed in
Southern Hemisphere soils, where magnetic “up” and “down” are reversed. The NASA scientists claimed that no known inorganic process
could have produced such an ordered crystalline array.
Finally, the fifth point: ALH84001 holds myriad tiny sausageshaped objects reminiscent of some species of terrestrial bacteria.
Though much smaller than any known Earthly microbes, these suggestive forms provided the public with its most convincing evidence
for Mars life. Hundreds of newspapers and magazines reproduced the

The main text of the McKay et al. six-page article in Science conveyed a sober and reasoned discussion of their findings, and they acknowledged that no single line of evidence was enough to trumpet the
discovery of alien life. But the concluding sentence shifted tone and
pushed the limits of most readers’ credibility: “Although there are alternative explanations for each of these phenomena taken individually,
when they are considered collectively, particularly in view of their spatial association, we conclude that they are evidence for primitive life on
early Mars.”
To paraphrase the late Carl Sagan, extraordinary claims require
extraordinary proof. Predictably, controversy exploded around the

NASA scientists’ bold claim. Experts pored over the paper, which was
aggressively challenged on every point.
Point number one: PAHs and other carbon molecules litter the
cosmos, notably in the interstellar dust that forms comets and asteroids—the raw materials that formed Mars. What’s more, such molecules would have formed in abundance by natural chemical processes
at or near the primitive surface of Mars. And PAHs are among the
most common constituents of pollution on Earth; the meteorite could
have become contaminated while sitting on the ice. There’s no reason
to conclude that these PAHs represent the remains of living cells.
Point two: The carbonate minerals could have formed in many
ways other than by circulating water. Carbonates can occur in reactions of rock with carbon dioxide, the most common Martian atmospheric gas. Carbonates commonly grow as alteration products, long
after the host rock forms, or directly from melts by igneous processes.
Indeed, a number of researchers reanalyzed the minerals and found
evidence that they had formed at temperatures well above the boiling
point of water.
Skeptical experts also argued that the minute magnetite crystals
prove nothing, since they are common constituents of meteorites that
bear no possible signs of life. The chainlike arrays of exceptionally pure
magnetite crystals are unusual, to be sure, but most observers feel that
magnetite grains are insufficient by themselves to prove the existence
of Martian life. Magnetotactic bacteria, furthermore, would have required a moderately strong Martian magnetic field—perhaps stronger
than geophysical evidence suggests.
Finally, the purported fossil microbes are too small—an order of
magnitude smaller than any known Earthly bacteria. In fact, they are
so small that they could contain no more than a few hundred
biomolecules—not nearly enough for a living cell. And there’s no reason to characterize them as fossils, since inorganic processes (including sample processing in the lab) are known to produce similar
elongated shapes.
The story became even more confused when scientists began examining other meteorites, Martian and otherwise, in the same meticulous detail afforded the Allan Hills specimen. Surprisingly, all
meteorites reveal signs of life—Earth life. Meteorites smash into Earth,
where our planet’s ubiquitous microbes inevitably contaminate them.
Almost every meteorite ever found has lain on the ground for periods

ranging from several days to many thousands of years. Once found,
they are usually handled, breathed on, and otherwise exposed to more
contamination. Unless hermetically sealed almost immediately, any
meteorite will be compromised. In a matter of months, microbes migrate deep into a meteorite’s interior, exploiting every crack and crevice in a search for the chemical potential energy that is stored in the
meteorite’s minerals. Given such a messy environment, how could anyone ever be sure about ALH84001?
One of the most vocal critics of the Martian claim was UCLA paleontologist J. William Schopf. A leading expert on microfossils and an
authority on Earth’s most ancient life, Schopf was outraged at what he
regarded as the NASA team’s shoddy analysis and unwarranted conclusions. At the well-publicized August 1996 NASA press conference to
discuss the discovery, Schopf was invited to participate as an objective,
dissenting voice. “I was like Daniel in the lion’s den,” he recalls. Not
wanting to publicly denigrate the NASA crowd, he may have pulled his
punches in that public forum (“I had tried to be reasonable, even
gentle”), but he underscored his criticisms of the NASA work in a
scathing addendum to his popular book, Cradle of Life (1999). There
he attacked the NASA team with a withering analysis, which he intensified by juxtaposing his critique of ALH84001 with stories of the most
egregious paleontological blunders of all time. Of the late famed meteorite, he wrote: “The minerals can’t prove it. The PAHs can’t either.
The ‘fossils’ could—but they don’t, and there are good reasons to question whether they are in any way related to life.”
Schopf concluded on a more philosophical note: “There are fine
lines between what is known, guessed, and hoped for, and because science is done by real people these lines are sometimes crossed. But science is not guessing.” Little did he suspect that within a few years those
righteous proclamations would come back to haunt him.
EARTH’S OLDEST FOSSILS—
THE SCHOPF–BRASIER CONTROVERSY
The top-down approach to life’s origins requires that we ferret out and
characterize Earth’s most ancient fossil life. Those fragile, fragmentary
clues may help us bridge the gulf between geochemistry and biochemistry, and thus deduce key steps in life’s emergence.
Fossil microbial life should be vastly easier to detect in Earth’s an-

cient rocks than in the handful of meteoritic fragments from Mars.
After all, we can collect tons of specimens, scrutinize their geological
setting, and check any critical measurements in many different laboratories. No matter how remote the rocks or treacherous the journey, it’s
well worth the effort, for Earth’s earliest fossils not only provide a
glimpse of the size and shape of ancient life but also reveal the timing
of life’s opening act.
Planet Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago as a giant, molten,
red-hot glowing sphere—the result of the accumulation of countless
comets, asteroids, and other cosmic debris. For another few hundreds
of millions of years, an incessant meteoritic bombardment pulverized
every square inch of Earth’s surface. What’s more, every few million
years an epic impact of an object a hundred kilometers or more across
punctuated the steady rain of smaller boulders. Such catastrophic
events would have repeatedly vaporized any nascent oceans and blasted
much of the primitive atmosphere into space. No imaginable life-form
could have survived the hellish onslaught of that so-called Hadean eon.
We don’t know exactly when cellular life arose, but the window of
opportunity appears to have been surprisingly short. It’s almost certain that life could not have persisted before about 4 billion years ago,
when the last of the great globe-sterilizing events is estimated to have
occurred. It’s always possible that life began several times before that,
only to be snuffed out by the periodic impact of devastating asteroids.
In any case, chemical evidence for life in Earth’s oldest known rocks—
formations 3.5 to 3.8 billion years old from Greenland, South Africa,
and Australia—seem to establish a remarkably ancient lower age limit
for life. Such a narrow time window suggests that life’s emergence was
rapid, at least on a geological timescale.
Paleontologists devote their lives to scrutinizing fragmentary signs
of life in rocks. It’s not always a glamorous business, mucking about in
inhospitable, remote landscapes, but there’s always the possibility for
making a big splash. Paleontologists, perhaps more than scientists in
any other discipline, can generate gripping headlines. Discoveries of
history’s biggest shark, most massive dinosaur, or oldest human inspire the public imagination. We live in an age of Guinness-style
records; we are obsessed with superlatives. One recent report in USA
Today even trumpeted the discovery of the oldest known fossilized penis in a 400-million-year-old crustacean!
With such a fossil-obsessed press corps, it’s little wonder that pale-

ontologist Schopf made the evening news (and Guinness World
Records) in April 1993 with his announcement in Science of the discovery of Earth’s oldest fossils (“Microfossils of the Early Archean Apex
Chert: New Evidence of the Antiquity of Life”). Schopf claimed to have
identified actual single cells, preserved in the 3.465-billion-year-old
Apex Chert from the sun-baked northwestern corner of Western Australia. Even more surprising, these cells occurred in filament-like chains
strongly reminiscent of those formed by modern photosynthesizing
microbes—cells with the relatively advanced chemical capability to
harvest sunlight.
As in the subsequent ALH84001 incident, the claims were extraordinary and consequently demanded extraordinary proof. In this case,
however, the geological community was generally quick to accept
Schopf ’s assertions, because he had established a reputation as one of
the world’s leading experts in finding and describing ancient singlecelled microbes. Schopf and his students had already catalogued dozens of new microbial species from 2-billion-year-old rocks around the
world, while establishing rigorous standards for the cautious identification and conservative reporting of new finds. The latest fossils merely
pushed back the record for the world’s oldest life a few hundred million years.
A straightforward UCLA protocol had become standard for the
maturing field of micropaleontology. Visit Earth’s geological formations of the Archean eon (4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), identify
layers of sediment that were deposited in ocean environments, and
scour the region for outcrops of distinctive carbon-rich rocks called
black chert. Field-workers collect hundreds of pounds of Archean
rocks, break off hunks of the most promising specimens, and ship them
back to California, where they are sliced into 2 × 3-inch transparent
thin sections, a few hundredths of an inch thick.
The research protocol for finding ancient microbes can be exceptionally tedious. Graduate students are coaxed and coerced into spending thousands of hours examining every part of every slide, micron by
eye-straining micron. It turns out that black chert isn’t really black at
all. Illuminated from beneath and viewed in a powerful microscope,
thin sections provide a window on the ancient world. The typical
cherty matrix is chockablock full of little black blobs and smudges.
Most black chert is seemingly barren of life, but once in a while a thin
section reveals a host of tiny spheres, disks, rods, and chains—dead

ringers for modern bacteria. Schopf was fortunate that in 1986 one
especially sharp-eyed and conscientious student, Bonnie Packer, scrutinized the most promising Australian specimens. Most thin sections
yielded nothing of interest, but her discovery of unambiguous microfossils in several ancient units led to a prominent publication and set
the stage for the Apex controversy.
Appearances can be deceiving. Lots of inorganic processes produce round specks and enigmatic squiggles. It’s all too tempting to see
what you want to see in an ancient rock. That’s why Schopf and his
colleagues had developed an arsenal of confirmatory tests. For one
thing, size matters. Single-celled organisms can’t be too small or too
big (though some remarkable ancient single-celled organisms are
monsters by modern standards). Even more critical, microbial populations tend to cluster tightly around one preferred size, in contrast to
the more random sizes of structures produced by nonbiological processes. Consequently, a statistical analysis of size distributions often
accompanied Schopf ’s papers. Uniformity of shape is another key; no
fair photographing one or two suggestively contoured black bits while
ignoring a multitude of shapeless blobs. Schopf also demanded rigor
in the description of local geologic setting and in the proper dating of
his samples. As a result, his work on the Apex Chert was initially accepted; he had established a solid reputation for cautious, conservative science.
But one aspect of Schopf ’s 1993 study—the claim that some of the
microbes were photosynthetic and hence oxygen-producing—remained puzzling. Geochemical evidence from Earth’s oldest rocks
points to an oxygen-poor atmosphere prior to about 2.2 billion years
ago, a time that most researchers identify with the rise of photosynthesis. How could oxygen-producing microbes be present more than a
billion years earlier? Nevertheless, within a few years Schopf ’s claims
for the earliest fossils were standard textbook fare; his pictures of Apex
fossils had become among the most frequently reproduced of all paleontological images. Schopf himself highlighted the historic findings in
Cradle of Life. [Plate 2]
Controversy erupted in March 2002, after Oxford paleontologist
Martin Brasier and a team of seven British and Australian colleagues
conducted a careful reexamination of the original type specimens of
the Apex Chert fossils, which had been deposited at the Natural History Museum in London. Brasier employed a microscopic technique

called image montage, which allowed him to use sharp images of the
original thin sections at many different levels within the rock slice to
reveal three-dimensional details that were not previously obvious.
Brasier’s microscopic investigation cast the Apex fossils in a new
light. Their 3-D structures seemed to differ sharply from those of any
known cellular assemblages. In some cases the “filaments” appeared to
be more like irregular planes or sheets. In others they branched, a feature never observed with cells. Brasier gave some of the more curious
shapes nicknames like “wrong trousers” and “Loch Ness monster.”
What’s more, the thin sections with the most convincing cell-like objects contained numerous additional black shapes that bore no resemblance at all to cells—forms that Schopf must have seen but failed to
detail in his Science paper.
Further study by Brasier’s geological colleagues in Australia
pointed to other discrepancies. Schopf had visited the site only briefly
and, based on the linear character of the outcrop, reported a classic
layered sedimentary sequence with the black chert lying between other
layers—a typical ocean-floor scenario. But after detailed field mapping
of the site, Australian geologists Martin van Kranendonk and John
Lindsay realized that the geological setting of the Apex Chert was much
more complex than the simple layered formation Schopf had described. Indeed, the Apex Chert formed at the site of significant hydrothermal activity, where hot volcanic fluids circulated through cracks
and fissures. According to their reinterpretation, the black chert formed
as a consequence of fluids circulating through this dynamic system as
part of a cross-cutting vein. Given this relationship, with the vein of
chert cutting across older rocks, the exact age of the Apex Chert was
called into question. More damning still, the hydrothermal setting suggested that the chert formed at temperatures far above the permissible
limits for life.
Brasier et al. challenged Schopf’s claims in an article titled “Questioning the evidence for Earth’s oldest fossils,” published in 2002 in the
widely read journal Nature. Their bold conclusion: “We reinterpret the
purported microfossil-like structure as secondary artifacts.” The article was a very public attack on Schopf ’s credibility.
In an unusual move, the editors of Nature had delayed the Brasier
et al. article for more than a year, to allow Schopf time to prepare a
rebuttal, “Laser-Raman imagery of Earth’s earliest fossils.” The two conflicting articles appeared back-to-back in the March 7, 2002, issue. An

accompanying “News and Views” analysis by Nature staffer Henry Gee
emphasized the irony of Schopf ’s predicament.
Seldom has a scientific debate held such high drama. Schopf had
made his reputation in part by staking claim to Earth’s oldest life, while
cutting no slack for the questionable claims of others. More than any
other scientist, he had thrown cold water on the NASA pronouncement of life on Mars. He reveled in reminding the public of past paleontological follies. No wonder then that science journalists were quick
to highlight the controversy: “CRADLE OF LIFE OR CAULDRON OF
CRUD?” one news headline asked.
This debate came to a head on April 9, 2002, at the second biennial
NASA Astrobiology Science Conference, with Schopf and Brasier
squaring off like graying, bespectacled wrestlers. The entertaining spectacle took place deep inside the gargantuan antique dirigible hanger of
Moffett Field, 30 miles south of San Francisco, which is home to the
NASA Ames Research Center. A sturdy lectern embossed with the
NASA logo stood on the stage, to the left of a large projection screen
about 12-feet square. Both speakers were seated on the stage, before a
rapt audience of several hundred scientists.
Schopf spoke first. A flamboyant presenter even under the calmest
of circumstances, Bill Schopf was fighting to preserve his scientific
reputation. Barely controlling his anger, his voice booming, he lectured
Brasier as if the Englishman were a recalcitrant schoolchild. Step by
step, in a talk rich in withering rhetorical questions and exaggerated
dramatic pauses, he reviewed the dozen or so necessary and sufficient
criteria to establish the authenticity of ancient fossil cells. Step by step,
he provided the data to back up his Apex claim, though he did soften
his assertion that the microbes were oxygen-producing cyanobacteria.
After 15 minutes or so, the moderator gestured that Schopf ’s allotted time was almost up. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat,
Schopf concluded by displaying new analytical data that he claimed
would prove his case once and for all. The smudgey black Apex Chert
“fossils” are composed principally of carbon, the essential element of
life. Carbon concentrations may arise by both biological and nonbiological processes, so carbon in and of itself is not diagnostic of life.
However, Schopf claimed, there is a difference: The carbon remains of
fossil cells are less perfectly ordered than crystalline carbon deposited
as a lifeless mineral. The degree of crystallinity, furthermore, can be
revealed by the established technique of Raman spectroscopy. Schopf

grandly presented a suite of Raman spectra: Indeed, sharp spiky peaks
characteristic of inorganic carbon stood in sharp contrast to the “obviously biological” broad humps in the Raman spectra from the Apex
Chert. Schopf concluded by summing up all the evidence he had mustered: “If it fits with all other evidence of life, well follks, most likely it’s
life.” [Plate 3]
Brasier gently ascended the stage and began his rebuttal with a
dismissive putdown of his rival’s presentation: “Well, thank you, Bill,
for a truly hydrothermal performance. More heat than light, perhaps.”
In soft-spoken Oxford English, the tone in sharp contrast to what had
come before, he began to cast doubt on Schopf ’s case. The most damning evidence were the fossils themselves. With the right lighting, field
of view, and level of focus, the Apex features do look like strings of
cells. The size is right, the shape more than a little convincing, and
there are even regularly spaced dark divisions that look like cell walls.
But raise or lower the focus slightly, or shift to another field of view,
and doubts arise. What are all those shapeless black blobs next to the
“fossil?” How can that supposed straight chain of cells suddenly branch
like a “Y”?
As Brasier warmed to his task, an agitated Schopf stood up and
began to pace distractingly a dozen feet behind the podium. Back and
forth he walked, hunched over, hands clasped firmly behind his back—
a tense backdrop to Brasier’s staid delivery.
Ignoring these diversionary tactics, Brasier fired salvo after salvo.
Schopf had the geology all wrong, he claimed. A new detailed geological map of the Apex area suggested that the black chert filled a crosscutting vein—evidence that the chert had formed much later than the
surrounding rocks, through the agency of hot circulating water. He
outlined chemical experiments that produced cell-like chains of precipitates in a purely inorganic setting—nonliving structures similar to
the supposed Apex fossils form with ease under the right chemical circumstances. He demonstrated how carbon-rich deposits might have
formed nonbiologically through a familiar industrial process called the
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. He even showed his own Raman spectroscopic data of inorganic carbon that had the same broad features as the
purported biological carbon of Schopf ’s fossils.
As Brasier calmly outlined his arguments, the scene on stage shifted
from awkwardly tense to utterly bizarre. We watched amazed as Schopf
paced forward to a position just a few feet to the right of the speaker’s

podium. He leaned sharply toward Brasier and seemed to glare, his
eyes boring holes in the unperturbed speaker. After a few seconds,
Schopf retreated to the back of the stage, only to return and stare again.
Perhaps Schopf was just trying to hear the soft-spoken Brasier in the
echoing hall, but the audience was transfixed by the scene.
The two presentations ended in due course and, after an extended
period for audience questions and comments, the session concluded.
Many of us breathed a sigh of relief that no blows had been exchanged,
and then we tried to figure out who won. We all knew, of course, that
science isn’t about winning. The black smudges in the Apex Chert were
either the remains of ancient microbes or they weren’t. Eventually, we
all assumed, the truth would be found out. A debate like the Schopf–
Brasier bout did little but outline the problem and establish our collective state of ignorance. Still, we wondered: Who won?
To be sure, Schopf ’s intense delivery and unconventional antics
hadn’t won him any points among my acquaintances. Many scientists
were also struck by the sudden softening of his previous claims that his
fossils were cyanobacteria. Such waffling undermined a decade of confident, highly public interpretations. But Schopf is also a fine scientist
with a long track record; and his systematic point-by-point analysis of
the fossils, however quirky in its delivery, appeared both logical and
persuasive.
Brasier’s cool detachment, by contrast, seemed calculated to provide a veneer of objectivity, yet that very lack of passion and intensity
may have cost him some points. So much of the Apex story relied on
interpretation of fuzzy objects in a fuzzier context. As doubtful as
Schopf ’s claims might be, it was equally difficult to disprove any biological activity by pointing to irregular black shapes. We have no way
of knowing what 3.5 billion years of decay might have done to ancient
microbes, and in many ways Brasier’s arguments were just as subjective as Schopf ’s. Rather than providing the audience with the smoking
gun that would thoroughly discredit Schopf, Brasier seemed merely to
have raised a number of serious doubts—knotty technical issues that
deserved further study.
Meanwhile, paleontologists around the world, Schopf and Brasier
included, keep searching thin sections of ancient rocks in hopes of finding Earth’s earliest fossils.

If there is a moral to the Allan Hills meteorite and Apex Chert controversies, it is that unambiguous identification of ancient life from microscopic structures is fraught with difficulty. Tiny rods and spheres
are not always useful indicators of biology. The older the rock, the more
difficult the interpretation of such vague features becomes. If fossils
are to provide any clues about life’s ancient emergence, then we have to
look beyond microscopic structures to the tiniest fossils of all.

Earth’s Smallest Fossils
Millions of brutal years of burial and resurfacing, akin to
repeated pressure cooking, permitted very few fossilized cells to
survive. . . . Often geologists must instead rely on other signs of
life, or biosignatures—including rather subtle ones, such as
smudges of carbon with skewed chemical compositions unique
to biology.

ven as the Schopf–Brasier battle raged, a small cadre of less publicized researchers labored to craft a convincing case for fossils even
more ancient than Apex. This new breed of paleontologist doesn’t depend on questionable black blobs. They probe rocks for fossils far
smaller than microscopic cell-like spheres or segmented filaments. Remarkably, the fossils they seek consist of the very atoms and molecules
of once-living organisms.
When a cell dies, its vital chemical structures quickly fragment and
decay. Almost always the essential atoms of biochemistry—carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and more—disperse and return to the environment. Earth’s vast but nevertheless finite reservoirs of life-sustaining atoms play their parts over and over and over again. Most of
the atoms in your body were once part of mastodons, dinosaurs, trilobites, even the earliest living cells. Take a moment to look at the palm
of your hand and imagine the fantastic yet unknowable histories of its
countless trillions of atoms. Earth’s biosphere is the ultimate recycling
machine.
Atoms almost always recycle, but once in a great while, under an
unusual concatenation of geological circumstances, a dying organism

swept away and buried in a sudden mudslide, if a colony of deep-sea
microbes solidifies in chert, if a winged insect dies ensnared in sticky
tree sap, then it’s just possible that some of the organism’s original
atoms and molecules will become trapped as well. Such a trapped fossil animal or microbe may persist through eons in its original form, or
it may decay to a shapeless dark splotch. Nevertheless, its hermetically
sealed atoms and molecules are the remains of past life, so they qualify
as fossils just as legitimate as the most elegant coiled ammonite or massive dinosaur.

FOSSIL ATOMS
It’s an amazing feeling to hold a 3-billion-year-old rock that once
teemed with living organisms—a sample that contains the very atoms
and molecules of cells from the dawn of life. Such rare and precious
samples demand a new approach to the study of fossils; traditional
descriptive paleontology must morph into analytical chemistry.
A casual conversation during the summer of 1997 with longtime
friend Andrew Knoll, professor of paleontology at Harvard University,
led me into this fascinating field. Andy and I were attending a Gordon
Research Conference on the origin of life, held at New England College
in Henniker, New Hampshire. He’s an engaging, articulate, and friendly
speaker, and the author of richly illustrated articles and lectures on the
diversity of microbial fossils in Earth’s oldest rocks—presentations that
opened a new world to me.
When most people hear the word “fossil,” they think of the bones
of a dagger-toothed Tyrannosaurus rex or the spiny shell of a trilobite—hard parts that survive the rigors of decay and burial. By contrast, the soft cellular tissues of animals, plants, and microbes almost
always rot away without a trace. Only occasionally will an organism die
and be buried in rock fast enough to preserve cellular detail. For a
micropaleontologist like Andy Knoll, whose specialty is ancient microbes, those rare cellular fossils provide the raw material for a career
in science.
The very earliest fossil cells are nondescript objects and difficult to
identify, but geologists have documented dozens of localities with numerous clearly identifiable microfossils dating from about 2.9 billion
years on. Distinctive bumpy rods and symmetrically spiky spheres,
chainlike filaments of repeated rectangles, and curious corkscrew spi-

rals form a panorama of primitive life. Andy’s work surveys the saga of
life’s evolution, culminating in the first enigmatic multicellular organisms about a billion years ago.
Throughout our conversations at the Gordon conference, I was
struck by the fact that many ancient microscopic fossil forms are preserved in black chert or shale—impermeable rocks that have the potential to preserve chemical traces of the original bacteria. Over a beer,
I asked Andy if paleontologists ever analyzed their microfossils with
the kind of machines that we mineralogists routinely employed to characterize the atoms and isotopes of our samples. He shook his head and
admitted that, while there had been a few pioneering studies, most
paleontologists worried almost exclusively about the sizes and shapes,
not the chemistry, of their bugs. Then came his deceptively innocent
question: “Do you want to collaborate? I’ve got a couple of students
with really interesting samples. . . .”
My own research on life’s emergence had to that point focused on
bottom-up chemical experiments, trying to synthesize life’s molecular
building blocks, but the top-down approach also has great appeal. I’ve
always loved fossils and was more than happy to associate myself with
a real paleontological pro, albeit in a modest support capacity. Agreeing to the offer, I immediately envisioned an arsenal of microanalytical
tools that might be brought to bear on the problem. Our conversation
soon turned to technical details: the number of samples, their size, the
degree of chemical alteration, and more.
The first samples arrived at Carnegie’s Geophysical Laboratory
from Harvard within a few months, and many more followed. A suite
of 400-million-year-old plants from Canada, slices of ancient black
soils from Australia, 3-billion-year-old microbial mats from South Africa, bizarre spiky spores from a billion-year-old Chinese formation—
wonderful fossils holding some of the secrets of life’s past. Our
Carnegie team quickly confirmed that ancient fossils have the potential to provide three important types of microanalytical data: chemical
elements, isotopes, and molecules. Of the three, the composition of
chemical elements is arguably the easiest to measure.
The mineralogist’s tool of choice for analyzing chemical elements
is the electron microprobe, a costly but indispensable piece of hardware in geology departments around the world. The machine works by
firing a narrowly focused beam of electrons at a highly polished piece
of rock, typically an inch or so across. The energetic electron beam

excites the rock’s atoms, which in turn emit a spray of X-rays. It turns
out that every element of the periodic table produces its own slightly
different suite of X-rays of different wavelengths. The task, then, is to
capture these X-rays and measure their diagnostic wavelengths.
Microprobe analysis of most elements has become routine and
automated. The machine is a workhorse, operating 24 hours a day for
analyses of silicon, magnesium, iron, and other rock-forming elements.
But the lightest elements, including the one of greatest interest to us—
the key biochemical element carbon—pose a severe analytical challenge. Lighter elements tend to be rather inefficient at producing
X-rays, while the relatively few X-rays that are produced have rather
low energies. Both of these factors complicate carbon analysis. What’s
more, we routinely use carbon to coat rock samples prior to probing,
in order to make them electrically conductive. The coat is essential to
prevent the sample from building up an electric charge while being
bombarded by electrons, but it can mask any carbon in our samples. In
short, the Lab’s usual microprobe procedures wouldn’t work. We’d have
to devise new protocols.
The Geophysical Lab’s deviser of protocols is Christos Hadidiacos,
microprobe jockey extraordinaire. For more than 30 years, Chris has
maintained and upgraded the Lab’s electron microprobe. He knows
every trick in the book and constantly invents new ones to push the
limits of analysis. Complex circuit diagrams, cryptic numerical tables,
and other papers decorate his office, while technical manuals and electronics catalogs fill his bookcases and rows of volleyball trophies line
the shelves above.
I explained the carbon analytical problem to him—one he had
never faced before. The Geophysical Laboratory probe had been used
almost constantly for decades but almost always to study rocks and
experimental run products—samples with mostly heavier elements.
But it took Chris less than a minute to figure out a possible fix. “We can
try raising the current,” he said. “That might work.” He began asking
detailed questions about the expected amount of carbon and what
other elements might be present. Then a frown. “We’re not going to be
able to use a carbon coat, are we?”
I shook my head, knowing that this was a potential deal killer. We
needed an electrically conductive coating, and that meant a metal. But
a carbon coat would mask our fossils, and most metals absorb X-rays

so efficiently that we’d never see the low-energy carbon X-ray signal.
“Any ideas?” I asked.
Again, it took him less than a minute. “Maybe we could use aluminum. Just vaporize a bit of aluminum foil.” He was smiling again,
pleased at the simplicity of his solution. Aluminum, element 15, should
be light enough itself to allow most of the carbon signal through. It
was definitely worth a try.
I handed over the first of my fossil specimens, a pair of 2 × 3-inch
rectangular thin sections of 400-million-year-old plant fossils from
Rhynie, Scotland, a classic chert locality. The samples had been collected many years ago as isolated flinty boulders in old stone walls; no
rock outcrop has ever been found. The precious thin sections arrived
courtesy of Kevin Boyce, a bright-eyed, soft-spoken grad student in
Andy Knoll’s group. Kevin had trolled through Harvard’s somewhat
neglected paleobotany collection as part of his thesis work on the evolution of leaves. He hoped that the Rhynie samples, which preserve
cellular structures of some of the oldest known land plants, might reveal clues about the chemical evolution of plants.
The first step was to apply the thin aluminum coating. Our antiquated but serviceable vacuum coating system consists of a well-worn
metal housing about the size of a washing machine with vacuum
pumps and hoses arranged inside. A 4-inch-square platform with wire
electrodes sits on top, while vacuum gauges and control valves project
from the side.
Chris snipped a 1-centimeter-square piece of aluminum foil,
crumpled it up and placed it in a small wire basket attached to the
electrodes. He arranged the two Rhynie chert thin sections on the metal
platform, and then lowered a 2-foot-tall dome-topped bell jar so that
its rubber-lined base made an airtight seal. The old pumping system
labored for a quarter of an hour to achieve the desired vacuum, but
then it took only a fraction of a second to apply an electric current and
vaporize the aluminum foil. Aluminum atoms flew off in all directions, coating everything inside the bell jar, including our samples.
Chris released the vacuum, raised the bell jar, and the fossils were ready
for the probe.
The Geophysical Lab electron microprobe is an awkward-looking
tabletop machine that sits in its own small room. [Plate 3] Two chairs

tower that looks like a model of some futuristic fortification. The tower
houses the electron gun, the heart of the probe. At the tower’s top, a
coiled tungsten filament generates electrons; a series of ring-shaped
electromagnets focus the electrons into a narrow beam as they accelerate downward onto the sample. The base of the tower is cluttered with
five boxlike attachments, called spectrometers, that measure X-rays,
plus various vacuum lines, power cables, and viewing ports.
A curious combination of instrument panels controls the electron
gun hardware and X-ray detectors. To the right, a computer monitor
displays all the machine’s vital statistics—beam current, spectrometer
settings, sample position, and more. In sharp contrast, a 1980s-vintage
slant-front console, sporting two antiquated 6-inch black-and-white
video screens and more than a dozen plastic knobs reminiscent of a
classic Star Trek set, dominates the central table. Like an old house that
has undergone decades of renovation, the Geophysical Lab probe has
been through a lot of upgrades.
I carefully secured one of the thin fossil sections into a shiny metal
sample holder, closed the sample port, and waited a couple of minutes
for the machine to achieve the high vacuum necessary to stabilize the
electron beam. Meanwhile, Chris fiddled with the computer controls,
raising the electron current to about ten times its normal settings. It
took him a few moments to center and focus the intense beam onto a
carbon-rich portion of our sample. We were about to discover whether
or not we could detect fossil carbon atoms.
It worked! A carbon signal of 600 X-ray counts per second stood
out sharply from the 30-count-per-second background. We were in
business. It was a simple matter to select half a dozen areas, each about
a fiftieth of an inch square, to map. Slowly but surely, the microprobe
beam scanned across the sample, measuring the carbon concentration
point by point. It took about 3 hours to produce one map. We put the
probe on automatic, happy with our rapid progress, and headed outside to the Lab’s sand court for our afternoon game of volleyball.
The analytical procedures took a bit of tweaking. The initial aluminum coatings were too thick, the beam settings not quite optimal.
But within a few weeks, we were producing a steady stream of colorful
maps; regions rich in carbon atoms from ancient life-forms stood out
boldly against the carbon-poor fossil matrix. Cellular features less than
a ten-thousandth of an inch across were clearly visible. Armed with

these maps, Kevin Boyce, with his sophisticated botanical eye, was able
to describe and interpret cellular detail never previously seen. [Plate 3]
Making these carbon maps, watching the fine details emerge, is
great fun. Each map is formed from a two-dimensional array of point
analyses, just like the pixels on your computer screen. We typically employ a quick 400 × 400-point array for reconnaissance, while slower
500 × 500-point arrays yield beautifully detailed maps with colors representing the concentration of carbon—red for the highest carbon content, followed by orange, yellow, and the other spectral colors. We play
with map colors like a high-tech video game to heighten the contrast
and highlight features of special interest.
Maps of the distribution of fossil carbon atoms can be dramatic
and surprising as well as beautiful, revealing subtle cellular-scale details not previously recognized. In a sense, though, this analytical effort
is little more than an extension of past morphological studies of fossil
size and shape—a slightly more elaborate way to image the specimens.
These carbon-rich fossils preserve far more information than just the
chemical elements that make them up. That’s why, for more than three
decades, geologists have examined ancient life for fossil isotopes.

FOSSIL ISOTOPES
The fascinating discipline of atomic-scale paleontology has blossomed
primarily because all living cells perform a wonderful repertoire of
distinctive chemical tricks. Life transforms any collection of its constituent atoms in subtle and surprising ways. Carbon atoms, for example, come in two common varieties—isotopes dubbed carbon-12
and carbon-13. Every carbon atom has exactly six massive positively
charged particles called protons in its nucleus; that atomic number, 6,
is the chemical definition of “carbon.” The distinction between the
two common carbon isotopes lies in the number of neutrons, a second kind of massive particle that also resides in the atomic nucleus.
Carbon-12 has six neutrons, while carbon-13 has seven.
The number of neutrons has no bearing whatsoever on carbon’s
chemical behavior. You could live equally well on a pure carbon-12
diet or a pure carbon-13 diet. But there is one important physical difference: Carbon-13, with its extra neutron, is about 8 percent more
massive than carbon-12. (An average-sized person whose cells were

made entirely with carbon-13 atoms would weigh about 2 pounds
more than the same person made entirely with carbon-12 atoms.) As a
consequence of this small mass difference, carbon-13 atoms are also a
little more sluggish than carbon-12 atoms when taking part in some
chemical reactions. So when living cells process carbon-bearing food,
they become slightly enriched in the lighter isotope, carbon-12. That
characteristic isotopic signature of life can be preserved for billions of
years in rock.
Analytical studies of countless carbon-bearing rocks reveal a sharp
dichotomy. Most of Earth’s carbon is locked into mineral deposits,
notably the abundant carbonates that adorn the landscape with bold
limestone cliffs and dissolve to open sublime limestone caverns.
Worldwide, this mineral-locked carbon has a well-defined uniform
ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 of about 99:1—the standard reference value, which is designated as 0. By contrast, living cells are invariably isotopically lighter, with a higher proportion of carbon-12 than
in limestone. This difference between limestone and life arises from
chemical reactions in cells, which more readily incorporate the lighter
carbon isotope.
On the geochemist’s peculiar scale, a 1 percent deficiency of carbon-13 relative to standard limestone is called “–10 per mil,” a 2 percent drop “–20 per mil,” and so on. Such “light” carbon in a rock sample
thus carries a negative number value and with it a strong presumption
of biological activity. Thousands of ancient fossil specimens, from
mammoth bones (about –21) to the 3.1-billion-year-old microbial
mats in South African sandstones and the fossils in Western Australian
chert (between –25 and –27), bear out this simple relationship. So does
fossil coal, the transformed remains of 300-million-year-old swamp
life, which typically ranges from –24 to –25. Carbon isotope studies of
soft-bodied fossils from the Burgess Shale, a 540-million-year-old British Columbian locality, made famous by Stephen Jay Gould’s Wonderful Life, display a similarly narrow range of values between –25 and
–27. The conclusion: If a rock holds an ancient inventory of carbon
atoms from once-living cells, then the carbon invariably will be light,
even if all morphological signs of life are gone.
The most ancient microbial samples, which often consist of black,
carbon-rich splotches in limestone, shale, or other sedimentary rock,
have received special attention in recent years. Dozens of studies on
billion-year-old rocks from Africa, Australia, Europe, and North

America reveal consistently negative carbon isotope values, but they
also point to a significant scatter among the dozens of known microbial fossils more than a billion years old. Photosynthetic microbes,
which live on sunlight, tend to lie in the –20 to –30 range. These organisms have dominated the fossil record since about 2 billion years ago,
when Earth’s atmosphere became oxygen-rich. However, many types
of more primitive single-celled organisms that live off the Earth’s
chemical energy are much more efficient at concentrating the light carbon isotope, carbon-12. Values as low as –50 have been found in 3.8billion-year-old sediments. While these differences help paleontologists
interpret the varied lifestyles of ancient microbes, all unambiguous cellular fossils contain some proportion of light carbon.
It’s amazing how nerve-wracking waiting for a machine to produce a single isotope value can be. I was given my most memorable
carbon-rich sample in the summer of 2002, during a lecture tour to
Australia. A side trip to Sydney’s northwestern suburbs brought me to
the campus of Macquarie University. There, in beautiful green landscaped grounds, is the home of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology,
whose director is paleontologist Malcolm Walter.
Walter’s work on ancient Australian microfossils was well known
to me, and it was a delight to meet him. He welcomed me with a strong
handshake, keen eyes, and ready smile and gave me a quick tour of the
facility, a tweed jacket his only protection from the mild Sydney winter.
My research was unknown to him, though he was well aware of the
well-funded NASA Astrobiology Institute, of which I was part. He listened as I described our various research projects, but his ears really
perked up when I recounted my collaborations at Carnegie with Andy
Knoll and his students. I outlined our procedures for mapping carbon
atoms and described some recent carbon-isotope results.
“You might be interested in this,” he said, handing me a small cloth
bag containing several black rock fragments. “It’s Strelley Pool Chert, a
new find from Trendall in Western Australia. It’s almost as old as the
Apex.”
The chance to hold, much less study, one of Earth’s oldest rocks is
a rare privilege. My response was rather pointed and less than subtle:
“We’d be happy to do the carbon work, if you’d like. I could do it next
week when I get back.” Few laboratories in Australia had the facilities
to analyze the ancient rock, while Carnegie was set up and ready to go.
A brief cloud of concern seemed to pass across Walter’s face, but

he hesitated only a moment before extracting a thumbnail-sized
sample, a tiny fraction of the valuable hoard. “Perhaps you could have
a look at this,” he said, and told me that he was eager to find out as
soon as possible whether or not the rock’s carbon was light. I slipped it
into my pocket, hardly believing my good fortune in having acquired a
piece of Earth’s earliest history. The sample would be a top priority on
my return, I assured him, and any data would be his to announce or
publish as he wished. Our conversation shifted to less scientific matters: the constant stress of raising money for the Institute, and the glories of his sheep farm in the countryside, where he spends his weekends.
For the rest of that Australian trip, the tiny, 3-ounce sample
weighed heavily on my mind, and it rose right to the top of a long “to
do” list on my return. When I need a carbon-isotope analysis at the
Carnegie Institution, I turn to Marilyn Fogel, a biologist who has
amassed an impressive arsenal of analytical hardware. Marilyn and her
group study the cycling of elements through ecosystems, and there’s
no better way to track an element than with isotopes. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes, both of which get progressively lighter as you move up
through the food chain, are her specialty. Fogel’s field areas tend to be
exotic: the crocodile-infested mangrove swamps of Belize, the parched
outback of Australia, the boiling springs of Yellowstone Park. Her growing scientific reputation and thoughtful mentoring style attract a steady
stream of postdocs and visitors.
I grabbed the stone and headed down the hallway mid-morning.
After the requisite niceties I got directly to the point: “I met Malcolm
Walter in Sydney.” I reached into my pocket and handed her the piece
of black chert. “Take a look at this.”
“Apex?” she asked. We all had been following the Schopf controversy, and she knew that Apex Chert samples were pretty hard to
come by.
“Nope, this is apparently new. Same area but different. He’d like a
carbon-isotope value.”
Marilyn doesn’t generally betray excitement, but she immediately
knew the significance. This black fragment was one of the oldest rocks
on Earth. “Wow, that’s pretty neat!” She turned the object over in her
hands. “Yes, I think the machine is available this afternoon.” She paused.
“Why don’t you come by around two.”
I passed the time by breaking off a small piece of the chert, crushing it in a mortar, immersing the powder in oil, and peering at the tiny

glassy shards through a powerful microscope. How curious it was—
unlike any rock I’d seen before. Myriad tiny black specks, each a few
ten-thousandths of an inch across, clouded the otherwise clear, colorless chert matrix. Unlike typical fossil microbes, which tend to occur in
clumps and filaments, these dots were uniformly dispersed. They certainly looked like carbon, but were they cells? Would they show a negative isotopic signature?
At two o’clock I showed up at Marilyn Fogel’s lab, as arranged.
Isotope experts rely on mass spectrometry, the experimental technique
of choice for measuring a sample’s isotopic ratio. Marilyn’s mass spectrometer for carbon-isotope analyses sits in one corner of a 20 × 40foot room crowded with scientific hardware. Little space is wasted, and
you have to exercise care not to bump into sensitive hardware when
squeezing between the various experimental stations. These days, mass
spectrometers tend to be highly automated and incredibly precise machines, though they still require meticulous maintenance and rigorous
standardization procedures to yield reliable results. With a machine
like Fogel’s, carbon-isotope analyses are relatively straightforward.
[Plate 4]
The mass spectrometer is a conceptually elegant analytical tool
grounded on two of the great physical laws of nature. Newton’s second
law of motion, F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration), enables
the separation of two atoms of different mass. As noted, carbon-12
and carbon-13 differ by about 8 percent in their mass, so if the two
isotopes are subjected to an identical force, then the carbon-12 atom
will accelerate about 8 percent faster than the carbon-13 atom. Mass
spectrometers accomplish this acceleration by applying a second fundamental law, related to electricity and magnetism: Magnetic fields
exert forces on electrically charged particles. The analytical technique
is to ionize the carbon atoms: Strip an electron from each—by zapping them with a laser, for example—to yield carbon atoms with a
positive electric charge, then subject the ionized atoms to a powerful
magnetic field. In some mass spectrometers, a massive horseshoeshaped magnet bends the stream of carbon atoms (bending is a kind
of acceleration, as you discover when you ride a twisting roller coaster).
Carbon-12 atoms curve in a tighter arc than carbon-13, so the beam
of carbon atoms separates into two. Two detectors placed side-by-side
measure the relative amounts of the two isotopes. Alternatively,
sensitive electronic detectors measure the time of each ion’s flight:

carbon-12 atoms arrive at a target a fraction of a second before
carbon-13 atoms.
Fogel’s mass spectrometer works best with a small powdered
sample, so I had crushed and ground a chip of chert to specifications.
Rocks are generally a lot easier to prepare than plant and animal tissues, which must be freeze-dried first. In duplicate, I carefully weighed
about a milligram of rock powder and tightly wrapped the powder
into a tiny ball of inert tin metal foil. Marilyn inserted a series of welldocumented carbon-isotope reference standards along with my
samples, each a crumpled metal sphere about the size of a BB, into
ports of the mass spectrometer’s automated sample holder. Then a
computer control system took over and we had to sit back and wait for
that one tantalizing number.
It takes only a few minutes per sample, but it seemed longer. The
standards always come first, of course; we have to make sure everything is working properly. Finally, the machine spewed out a single
printed sheet of white paper, crammed with columns of numbers. One
number at the bottom was the key: –25.7 ± 0.5. The carbon was light—
just what we’ve learned to expect from ancient microbes! The analysis
also indicated that about a tenth of a percent of the chert’s mass was
carbon. The duplicate run soon followed: –25.9—satisfyingly consistent results.
But even as we saw these enticing numbers, a nagging doubt remained about the biological origin of the carbon. The oddly uniform
distribution of black specks in the chert looked nothing like fossil
forms. Indeed, the uniform spacing suggested a more chemical process—a segregation of carbon from chert as oil drops separate from
water. Might there be nonbiological pathways to such a light carbon
signature? All known life-forms have a negative isotope signature, but
does a negative isotope value provide unambiguous proof of life? We
were convinced that the Australian chert had a fascinating story to tell.
I e-mailed Malcolm Walters right away with the exciting data and
a quick analysis of their possible significance. It would take a bit more
work, I thought, but these were certainly publishable results. His reply
came slowly, and with a disappointing surprise. Please stop working
on the samples, he asked. Evidently, Walter’s Australian colleague, paleontologist Roger Summons, had been promised the chance to analyze the new find. Summons, a pioneer at extracting biomolecules from

our efforts to undermine that thesis project.
A deal’s a deal. I put aside the chert and went back to the seemingly
endless list of other projects. But it sure was fun while it lasted.

EARTH’S OLDEST “FOSSILS”?
What does a negative carbon-isotope value tell us about an ancient
rock? This question came into focus following a surprising announcement in the November 7, 1996, issue of Nature of the discovery of
Earth’s most ancient fossil carbon. The Earth’s oldest known rocks,
3.85-billion-year-old banded-iron outcrops from the remote island of
Akilia off the southwest coast of Greenland, reveal not the slightest
trace of anything that looks like a fossil. Nevertheless, these rocks may
contain a modest store of carbon. Even though the rocks have experienced severe alteration through the ravages of temperature, pressure,
and time, some of that carbon is encased in the protective mineral
apatite. When Scripps Institution of Oceanography geochemist
Stephen J. Mojzsis (now at the University of Colorado) and his colleagues collected those rocks and performed the first carbon-isotope
analysis at UCLA in 1996, they were delighted to find light carbon, on
average a dramatic 3.7 percent lighter than reference limestone. No
known abiotic process produces that kind of value. That simple number, –37, was enough to convince many geologists that life had achieved
a firm foothold by that ancient date.
Such a result did much more than establish a world record for
ancient life. The work of Mojzsis and his colleagues seemed to narrow
the window for life’s origin, which presumably couldn’t have emerged
until after the last global sterilizing asteroid impact, roughly 4 billion
years ago. If signs of life persist in 3.85-billion-year-old rocks, then life
arose very quickly indeed.
But, as it turned out, the Akilia rocks posed problems. Earth’s oldest rocks have been through a lot: heated and squeezed and contorted
beyond belief. Billions of years inevitably alter the fabric of a rock.
Mojzsis interpreted the Akilia formation, with its appearance of intensely folded layers, as metamorphosed oceanic sediments—a perfectly reasonable residence for early cellular life. But when geologists

Christopher Fedo of George Washington University and Martin
Whitehouse of the Swedish Museum of Natural History performed a
more detailed geological analysis of the carbon-bearing outcrop, the
rocks proved to be an ancient molten igneous mass that gradually solidified deep underground from temperatures approaching 1,000°C.
The carbon deposits must have formed under extreme metamorphic
conditions deep in the crust. Under no circumstance could those rocks
have contained life at the time of their formation.
Scientists quickly came up with a range of plausible explanations
for the light carbon. Heating experiments, which preferentially release
recent organic contaminants, revealed that some of the rocks’ carbon
is modern. It’s also possible that some natural nonbiological processes
also generate light carbon. Today much of the carbon cycle is regulated
by life, and all carbon compounds derived from living organisms are
isotopically light. But before the first microbial life, there could have
been equally vigorous geochemical processes that separated carbon-12
from carbon-13. If so, then isotopes alone can provide scant help in
recognizing life in Earth’s most ancient formations—or from rocks on
other worlds, for that matter.
At best, the isotopic evidence from Greenland is ambiguous. And
so, in their search for unambiguous proof of ancient life, paleontologists have had to turn to even more elusive fossils—fragments of life’s
oldest biomolecules.

The ability of the major atomic components of the cell to
combine into molecules of considerable complexity . . . is
enormous. However, the actual number of compounds that

n a sense, you are what you eat. Nutrition labels on the side of every
packaged food underscore this biochemical fact: Fats, carbohydrates,
and proteins satisfy life’s energy requirements (i.e., calories) and provide life’s most basic molecular building blocks as well.
Carbon, the essential element of life, combines with other atoms
in every living cell to form the molecules of life. Even as ancient rocks
can entomb the original carbon isotopes from cells, so too, under the
right circumstances, they can preserve larger fragments of life’s
biomolecules. Such molecular remnants hold great promise for identifying ancient life, because terrestrial life is so remarkably, uniquely idiosyncratic in its choice of chemical building blocks.
SYNTHETIC QUIRKINESS
Consider the example of life’s hydrocarbons, the molecular family that
includes waxes, soaps, oils, and all manner of fuels, from gasoline to
Sterno. All cells require a rich variety of these molecules, which incorporate long, chainlike segments of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons, which we eat in the form of fats and oils, serve many
cellular functions, including the production of flexible cell membranes,
efficient energy storage, varied internal support structures, and more.

GENESIS

In life and in commerce, long hydrocarbon molecules are usually
made by linking smaller pieces end-to-end. When industrial chemists
want to synthesize hydrocarbons, or when these molecules arise by
natural nonbiological processes, the molecular chains are usually
lengthened one carbon group at a time. This process ordinarily yields a
suite of molecules with many different lengths, from just a few to many
dozens of carbon atoms long, but all formed by the same stepwise
mechanism.
Life builds hydrocarbons differently and in a strikingly idiosyncratic way. In each cell an amazing tool kit featuring half-a-dozen different protein catalysts, collectively called the “fatty acid synthase,”
facilitates the assembly of hydrocarbon chains by adding units of three
carbon atoms to a growing chain and then stripping one away. The net
result is carbon addition by pairs. So life’s biochemistry is often characterized by a preponderance of hydrocarbon chains with an even
number of carbon atoms: chains of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms occur
in preference to 11, 13, or 15. As a result, given a suite of molecules
from some unknown source and a mass spectrometer that can analyze
the size distribution of those molecules, it’s not too difficult to tell
whether the hydrocarbons came from living cells or from nonbiological processes.
Polycyclic compounds, an even more dramatic example of life’s
molecular idiosyncrasies, include a diverse group of carbon-based
molecules with several interlocking 5- and 6-member rings. A variety
of cyclic molecules are found everywhere in our environment. Even
before Earth was born, they were produced abundantly by chemical
reactions in interstellar space and during star formation—processes
that littered the cosmos and seeded the primitive Earth with cyclic organic molecules. The PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) found
in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 are examples of these ubiquitous
compounds. Cyclic molecules continue to be synthesized on Earth as
an inescapable by-product of all sorts of burning: They are found in
the soot of fireplaces and candles, the smoke of incinerators and forest
fires, and the exhaust of diesel engines. Travel to the remotest places on
Earth—the driest deserts of North Africa, deep ocean sediments, even
Antarctic ice—and you’ll find PAHs.
Every living cell manufactures a variety of polycyclic carbon compounds but, as with hydrocarbon chains, the polycyclic compounds

produced by life are much less varied than those produced by inorganic processes. The 4-ring molecules called sterols, including cholesterol, steroids, and a host of other vital biomolecules, underscore this
point. Literally hundreds of different 4-ring molecules are possible, yet
while the relatively random processes of combustion or interstellar synthesis yield a complex mixture of cyclic compounds, life zeroes in almost exclusively on sterols and their by-products.
Again, cells employ a remarkably quirky synthesis pathway. The
first step in forming a sterol is to manufacture lots of isoprene, a 5carbon branching molecule (which the cell makes from three smaller
molecules). Six isoprene molecules line up end-to-end to form

short line segment represents a chemical bond between two carbon atoms.

squalene, with 30 carbon atoms—24 of them in a chain, with six single
carbon atoms branching off at regular intervals. This long molecule
then folds up into the 4-ring sterol backbone.
Biochemical textbooks describe dozens of other examples of elaborate synthetic pathways: photosynthesis to make the sugar glucose, glycolysis (splitting glucose) to make the energy-rich molecule ATP
(adenosine triphosphate), metabolism via the citric acid cycle, the production of urea, and countless other vital chemical processes. Over and
over, we find that cells zero in on a few key molecules. DNA and RNA,
which carry the genetic code, rely on ribose and deoxyribose alone,
eschewing the dozens of other 5-carbon sugars. Proteins are constructed from only 20 of the hundreds of known amino acids. What’s
more, sugars and amino acids often come in mirror-image pairs—socalled “right-handed” and “left-handed” variants—but life uses righthanded sugars and left-handed amino acids almost exclusively.
The take-home lesson is that life is exceedingly choosy about its
chemistry. Of the millions of known organic molecules with up to a
dozen carbon atoms, cells typically employ just a few hundred. This
selectivity is perhaps the single most diagnostic characteristic of living
versus nonliving systems. If an ancient rock is found to hold a diverse
and nondescript suite of organic molecules, then there’s little we can
conclude, yea or nay, about its biological origins. It may once have held
life, or it may simply represent an abiotic accumulation of organic junk.
If, on the other hand, an old rock holds a highly selective suite of carbon-based molecules—predominantly even-numbered hydrocarbon
chains or left-handed amino acids, for example—then that’s strong
evidence that life was involved.
A crucial requirement, if this logic is to be implemented in the
search for life here or on other worlds, is that biomolecules must be
stable over time spans of billions of years. Large protein molecules
won’t last that long, and neither will the 20 amino acids that comprise
the building blocks of proteins. Nor will most carbohydrates or hydrocarbon chains. Over time, water attacks the bonds of these
biomolecules, breaking them into smaller fragments of no diagnostic
use. But polycyclic compounds, like sterols, degrade more slowly and
might survive over geological spans of time. Therein lies a possible
top-down path to the discovery of life that is distant in space or time.

THE HOPANE STORY

Copyright   2005. Joseph Henry Press. All rights reserved.

Once in a very great while, extremely old rocks are found to hold microscopic droplets of a petroleum-like black residue—hydrocarbons
that represent the remains of ancient marine algae. When such droplets were first discovered, decades ago, most scientists discounted the
possibility that these organic remains were very old; no oil could survive billions of years of geological processing, they said. But subsequent discoveries and improved analytical techniques have convinced
the geological community that a hardy breed of organic hydrocarbons
can survive in ancient rock provided that temperatures never got too
high.
In their quest for life signs, a group of Australian scientists has
focused upon what are perhaps the ideal biomarkers—distinctive sterol-derived polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules called hopanes. This
group of elegant 5-ring molecules is known in nature only from the
biochemical processes of cellular life, where it concentrates in protective cell membranes. Furthermore, different variants of hopanes point
to specific groups of microbes with distinctive biochemical lifestyles. If
an ancient rock happens to encase and preserve hopane-related molecular fragments with the diagnostic structures of once-living
biomolecules, then we have convincing evidence of ancient life.
In 1999, a team of scientists led by Roger Summons (then at the
Australian Geological Survey Organisation) presented compelling evidence for the survival of hopanes in a sequence of 2.7-billion-year-old

This 5-ring structure is characteristic of hopane, a distinctive biomolecule whose
backbone may be preserved for billions of years in ancient sediments.

sedimentary rocks called the Pilbara Craton, in Western Australia. The
black, carbon-rich shale layers in question came from a section of drill
core extracted from a depth of about 700 meters. The mineralogy of
the shale revealed that it had never experienced a temperature higher
than about 300°C—an unusually benign history for such an ancient
deposit.
Hopanes have been common biomolecules for a long time, so the
Australian team’s principal challenge was ruling out contamination
from more recent life. The rocks might have been contaminated hundreds of millions of years ago by subsurface microbes, or by groundwater carrying biomolecules from the surface, or perhaps even by oil,
seeping from some other sedimentary horizon. Summons and his colleagues discounted the last of these possibilities because they found no
trace of petroleum in adjacent sediment layers. Modern contamination from living cells, which abound in the lubricants that scientists
use to drill their deep holes in the host rock, was also a concern. The
team ruled out such contamination, too, because the suite of molecules
preserved in the shale was “mature,” containing none of the fragile organic species that would point to recent lubricants and accompanying
microbial activity.
Summons and his co-workers had to develop meticulous procedures to expose and clean unadulterated fresh rock surfaces: Break the
rock, wash the surface, and measure the wash for contamination. They
resorted to smaller and smaller rock fragments to avoid the inevitable
impurities that had seeped in along cracks. Summons found that properly prepared powdered shale contained a distinct suite of ancient hydrocarbon molecules at hundreds of times higher concentrations than
in adjacent chert and basalt layers from the same drill core. Nevertheless, the amount of hopanes was minuscule: of all the carbon-rich material extracted from the rock, no more than a precious few hundred
parts per million were hopanes and related polycyclic molecules. Still,
the very presence of hopanes provided evidence for ancient microbial
life.
Having overcome daunting hurdles, Summons and his colleagues
announced their finding in August 1999, in two remarkable papers,
one in Science and the other in Nature. The Science article detailed extraction of hopanes from 2.7-billion-year-old shale—results that broke
the previous record for the oldest molecular biomarker by about a billion years. The Nature article described the discovery of hopanes from

2.5-billion-year-old Australian black shale—a younger nearby formation, but with a twist. That formation included 2-methylhopanoid, a
hopane variant known to occur in cyanobacteria, which are the primitive photosynthetic microbes responsible for generating Earth’s oxygen-rich atmosphere. The Australian team had found suggestive
evidence that cyanobacteria were thriving long before 2 billion years
ago, when Earth’s atmosphere is thought to have achieved modern levels of oxygen.
By extracting and identifying unambiguous biomarkers in ancient
rocks, Summons and colleagues had made a major advance in detecting and characterizing ancient life. They also helped close the gap in
our ignorance of life’s emergence by embellishing the top-down story
and pushing it just a little bit further back in time.

BIOSIGNATURES AND ABIOSIGNATURES
The quest for unambiguous “biosignatures,” including hopanes and
other distinctive molecules, represents an effective strategy in the
search for ancient life on Earth and other worlds. However, the identification of “abiosignatures”—chemical evidence that life was never
present in a particular environment—might also prove important in
constraining models of life’s emergence.
Abiosignatures hold special significance to astrobiologists, who
search for life in Martian meteorites and other exotic specimens. Are
there physical or chemical tests that might preclude the presence of
past life in those specimens? “NO LIFE ON MARS!” would be a bummer of a headline, but would nevertheless carry great scientific, not to
mention philosophical, implications about the frequency of life’s
emergence.
Hopanes not only represent biosignatures for ancient life on Earth,
but they also point to a search strategy for other worlds, especially our
nearest neighbor, Mars. Based on what we now know about life and its
fossil preservation, we are unlikely to find unambiguous Martian fossils of single cells, much less animals or plants, at least not any time
soon. A Mars sample return mission won’t happen for at least a dozen
years, while human exploration of the red planet is many decades away.
And even with such hands-on exploration, we’d be incredibly lucky to
find a convincing fossil. We’re much more likely to find local concentrations of carbon-based molecules, from which we can determine the

GENESIS

carbon-isotopic composition. However, as the Greenland incident reveals, a simple isotopic ratio may not be sufficient to distinguish
nonbiological chemical systems from those that were once living.
Suites of carbon-based molecules, if we can find them, hold much
greater promise. An array of molecular fragments derived from a
colony of cells, if not too degraded, will differ fundamentally from a
geochemical suite synthesized in the absence of life. For now, molecules
represent our best hope of finding proof of life both here and elsewhere in our solar system.
The ideal molecular biosignatures—and abiosignatures as well—
must display three key characteristics. First, biosignatures should consist of distinctive molecules or their diagnostic fragments that are
essential to cellular processes. Similarly, abiosignatures should consist
of molecules that clearly point to nonbiological processes.
The second criterion is stability: biosignatures—and abiosignatures as well—must be molecules able to survive through geological
time. Even the least altered ancient sediments have been subjected to
billions of years of temperatures greater than the boiling point of water—conditions that significantly alter the chemical characteristics of
any suite of organic molecules, whether biological or not. This criterion of stability, consequently, focuses our attention on unusually
stable molecules.
Finally, the molecules must occur commonly and in reasonable
abundance. A molecular biosignature or abiosignature is of no use unless it can be detected by mass spectrometry or other standard analytical techniques.
Hopanes, and the related sterols, are unquestionably excellent diagnostic biosignatures from the standpoint of stability, and they’re reasonably easy to analyze. Many ancient deposits yield traces of these
molecules, and they will continue to be a tempting target for analysis,
as well as a model for finding other biosignatures. But hopanes are
probably not the ultimate answer in the search for signs of life: They
seldom occur in abundance, and their absence cannot be taken as a
reliable abiosignature.
An alternative to the search for reliable biosignatures and
abiosignatures might be to identify diagnostic ratios of molecular fragments, akin to the carbon-12/carbon-13 isotopic ratio. However, we’re
confronted with a vast multitude of possible molecule pairs. Which
pair of molecules should we study?

My first foray into the search for biomarkers occurred in the summer of 2004. Preliminary studies by George Cody on organic compounds in meteorites prompted us to look at the ratio of two of the
commonest PAHs: anthracene and phenanthrene. These 3-ring polycyclic molecules, both made up of 14 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen
atoms (C14H10), differ only in the arrangement of the rings: In anthracene the rings form a line, in phenanthrene a dogleg. We realized
that the ratio of these two molecules might fulfill the essential
biomarker requirements: Both are distinctive, relatively stable, common in the geological record, and easy to detect in trace amounts.
Phenanthrene and anthracene form in abundance through a variety of nonbiological processes, including any burning process that produces soot. These cyclic compounds are also synthesized in deep space,
where they contribute to the molecular inventory of the carbon-rich
meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites. The most celebrated of
these is the Murchison meteorite, which fell to Earth in a cow field
outside the small town of Murchison, about 100 miles north of
Melbourne, Australia, on September 28, 1969. Meteorites hit Earth all
the time, but the Murchison fall was special. For one thing, it was big—
several kilograms of rock. For another, it was fresh and relatively un-

Phenathrene (top) and anthracene are 3-ring polycyclic molecules that differ only
in their shape. The ratio of these two molecules differs in abiotic and biological
systems.

contaminated—a number of pieces were collected while they were still
warm. But, most important, the Murchison was a carbonaceous chondrite, containing more than 3 percent by weight of organic molecules.
That black, resinous matter, formed billions of years ago in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, held a treasure trove of the
molecules that could have accumulated on the prebiotic Earth.
George Cody had found that such meteorites often display about
a 1:1 ratio of phenanthrene to anthracene. But biochemical processes
seem to produce a different ratio. Many polycyclic biomolecules—including sterols and the varied hopanes—incorporate a 3-ring dogleg,
so phenanthrene is a common and expected biomolecular fragment,
and it should persist in rocks and soils, even when larger molecules
break down. But for some reason, life almost never uses anthracene’s
linear arrangement of three rings. Anthracene would thus seem to be
correspondingly rare as a biomolecular fragment. Cody had found that
biogenic coals typically hold 10 times more phenanthrene than
anthracene.
Is the ratio of phenanthrene to anthracene a useful biomarker?
Testing this idea required measuring the ratios of cyclic compounds in
lots of samples, so that was the task I gave to Rachel Dunham, a bright
and energetic undergraduate summer intern from Amherst College.
Over the course of her 10-week stay in Washington, Rachel assembled
dozens of natural and synthetic PAH-containing samples from around
the world, analyzed them with our gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, and managed to track down many more analyses from the vast
coal and petroleum literature, since it turns out that PAHs are especially abundant in some fossil fuels.
The first few data points seemed to support the hypothesis. The
Murchison and Allan Hills meteorites showed phenanthrene-to-anthracene ratios of 1.7:1 and 2:1, respectively. The biogenic Burgess
Shale and a mature coal, on the other hand, yielded much higher ratios, close to 15:1. But then results began to scatter. Some low-grade
coals had ratios less than 5:1, while the black, fossil-rich Enspel Shale
was only about 2:1. The promising hypothesis began to crumble.
After several weeks of effort, and a thorough review of the published literature, Rachel discovered that we were simply reinventing
the wheel. Coal experts have long known that anthracene is slightly
less stable than phenanthrene. Consequently, “high-grade” coals that
have experienced prolonged high temperatures and pressures have a

higher ratio of phenanthrene to anthracene, topping 20:1 in some
specimens. Such a high ratio in any sample may have resulted from
prolonged heating and have nothing at all to do with a biogenic past.
Our only useful conclusion was that unambiguously biological
specimens never seem to display ratios less than about 2. So a lower
ratio of phenanthrene to anthracene, as found in meteorites, syntheticrun products, and soot from burning carbon, may provide a valid
abiomarker.
The next step? Perhaps we’ll try another PAH ratio, such as that of
phenanthrene to pyrene, a particularly stable diamond-shaped molecule with four interlocking rings (C16H10). One thing is certain: we’ll
never run out of molecules to try.

LOOKING FOR LIFE ON MARS
The most exciting, important, and potentially accessible field area to
look for ancient alien life is Mars, which, like Earth, formed some 4.5
billion years ago. A mass of new data points to an abundance of surface
water during the planet’s first billion years, dubbed the Noachian epoch by Mars geologists. Sunlit lakes, hydrothermal volcanic systems,
and a benign temperature and atmosphere might have sparked life and
made Mars habitable long before Earth. Perhaps fossils, molecular and
otherwise, litter the surface.
The quest for Martian life has a checkered history. A century ago,
American astronomer Percival Lowell reported observations of a network of canals on the red planet—evidence of an advanced civilization, he thought. Such speculation fueled the imaginations of science
fiction writers, but hardened the scientific community to such unsubstantiated claims. NASA’s remarkable Viking Mars lander of the mid1970s carried an array of experiments designed to find organic
compounds and to detect cellular activity, but ambiguous results
merely led to more controversy. Hot debates over purported fossils in
the Allan Hills Martian meteorite represent just one more chapter in
this contentious saga. Given such a troubled context, NASA will choose
its next round of life detection experiments with the greatest of care.
Humans aren’t going to set foot on Mars anytime soon, but that’s
what NASA’s amazing rovers are for. Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and
other robotic vehicles provide the experimental platform; they haul
the instruments across the desolate Martian surface to probe tantaliz-

ing rocks and soils. The key to finding life (or the lack thereof) is to
design and build a flight-worthy chemical analyzer for life. That has
been the occupation of Andrew Steele throughout much of his career.
“Steelie,” my ebullient colleague at the Geophysical Laboratory, is
a microbial ecologist who got his start studying the microbial corrosion of stainless steel in nuclear reactors. British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
sponsored his PhD thesis, which is still largely classified and unpublished. Radioactive isotopes often contaminate the thin outer layer of
stainless steel that lines nuclear reactors—a difficult and costly cleanup problem. Steelie invented new microscopic techniques to study the
steel surfaces, and he found that some microbes secrete biofilms that
rapidly eat away steel, thus stripping off the affected layers and greatly
simplifying decontamination. [Plate 4]
In 1996, just two weeks after defending his PhD thesis in England,
the Allan Hills meteorite story broke. The timing was perfect, and
Steelie was hooked. Setting his sights on nonradioactive ecosystems, he
became obsessed with attempts to detect ancient life from the faint
molecular traces in rocks. He contacted the NASA team, who were lacking in microbiology expertise and thus eager for his help. David McKay
sent him a sample of the precious Martian rock, and within a year
Steele had applied his microscopic techniques to investigations of the
purported microbes. He made a memorable presentation at NASA’s
annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston and
landed himself a job as a NASA microbiologist working at the Johnson
Space Center under McKay’s guidance.
Steelie’s assignment at NASA was to head the JSC Blue Team (consisting of Steele and a fellow gadfly), who were to try out every possible
idea to disprove the hypothesis of Martian life in the Allan Hills meteorite. McKay led the significantly larger competing Red Team. McKay’s
strategy of examining both sides of the issue was laudable and in the
best tradition of scientific objectivity, but it may have backfired when
Steelie did his job too well. He performed a series of high-resolution
microscope studies and by 1998 had discovered that the Allan Hills
specimen (like virtually every other meteorite he had ever examined)
was riddled with contaminating Earth microbes. McKay was
unconvinced and continued to promote his original interpretation of
ALH84001. Discouraged at the cool reception accorded his findings,
and missing his wife and family in England, Steele left his steady NASA
employment in early 1999 for a hectic schedule of visiting professor-

ships and research jobs at the Universities of Montana, Oxford, and
Portsmouth, along with more NASA consulting.
About the time that Andrew Steele’s research was making him
something of a persona non grata at the Johnson Space Center, the
Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory found itself under new
leadership. Wes Huntress, the former associate administrator of the
NASA Office of Space Science (and the man who introduced the term
“astrobiology” to the NASA community), had been hired to shake
things up and expand Carnegie’s fledgling astrobiology effort. In a bold
and welcome move, Huntress made Steele his first staff appointment
in 2001. Steelie’s peripatetic scientific lifestyle seemed unsuited to the
traditional academic world, but his unconventional background was
just the ticket for the Geophysical Lab.
He arrived like a whirlwind, his shoulder-length blond hair and
open tie-dyed lab coat flying behind him as he dashed between office
and lab. Crates and boxes arrived by the dozen at his second-floor domain, two doors down from my own office. He crammed his lab space
with DNA sequencers, chip writers and chip readers (benchtop machines that prepare and read slides), and a bewildering array of other
microbiological hardware, most of which none of us geologists had
ever seen before. A small army of bustling postdocs followed and the
corridor took on new life. Chemist Mark Friese brought his collection
of orchids to grace one alcove with a forest of exotic blooms. Molecular biologist Jake Maule maintained his pro-level golf game by challenging all comers to putting contests—a regular stream of golf balls
began rolling past my open doorway.
In such an environment, new ideas fly thick and fast. Steelie had a
master plan. He wanted to build a life-detecting machine to fly to
Mars—a huge interdisciplinary project, given how much we still don’t
know. On the scientific side, he had to figure out what constitutes a
legitimate biosignature, so Steelie embarked on various paleontology
projects, principally with German postdoc Jan Toporski, who happens
to be his brother-in-law and soccer buddy. (There are also a lot of soccer balls and other soccer paraphernalia in the corridor.) They focused
on a 25-million-year-old fossil lake in Enspel, Germany, where wellpreserved fish, tadpoles, and other animals are found. Studies of their
molecular preservation would provide important hints about life’s
most stable and diagnostic molecular markers.
Then there was the detection part. It was essential to develop an

unambiguous procedure to find the tiniest amounts of any target molecule. That’s where Jake Maule came in. An aspiring astronaut trained
in clinical medical technology, Jake’s job was to develop molecular antibodies—proteins with specialized shapes that would lock onto only
one type of target molecule. [Plate 4]
Jake focused on producing hopane antibodies for use in a rapid
and sensitive field test for microbes. His procedure involved injecting
mice with hopanes and letting their immune systems do most of the
work. Hopanes are too small to evoke an immune response by themselves, so Jake attached hopane molecules to a big protein called BSA
(for bovine serum albumin). He injected 30 mice with a hopane–BSA
solution, waited a week, and gave each a booster shot. In about three
weeks, the mice manufactured a suite of hopane-sensitive antibodies.
From each mouse, Jake extracted a syringe full of blood, which was
centrifuged to separate out the red and white blood cells from the watery fluid that held the antibodies. Ultimately, each mouse yielded one
tiny, precious droplet of that antibody-rich fluid.
Armed with hopane antibodies, Maule was ready to analyze ancient rocks, in an elegant four-step process.
Step 1: He crushed various promising rock samples and washed
them in a solvent, which concentrated any hopane residues. Those solutions were loaded into the chip writer, a sleek benchtop machine
about the size of a breadbox that placed an array of tiny dots of the
solutions (some containing hopane and others not) and various standards onto a glass slide.
Step 2: With the chip writer, he applied a tiny amount of hopane
antibody onto each of the sample spots, then rinsed. Some spots then
retained hopanes with attached antibodies, while other spots were
washed clean.
Step 3: He then treated each spot with another solution, this one
containing a second antibody that locks onto any mouse antibody and
is also highly fluorescent. All the spots with hopanes attached to mouse
antibodies would thus fluoresce.
Step 4: Finally, he took the glass slide with its array of spots and
put it into a second sleek machine, the chip reader, which, as its name
suggests, recorded which spots fluoresced and which spots didn’t. Like
microscopic lightbulbs, his antibodies glowed when hopanes were
present in the rock sample.

Jake had devised a fast, automated process for identifying hopanes.
But all that work and more was mere prelude to the most crucial aspect of a flight-ready analytical instrument—the design and engineering. Concepts and benchtop demonstrations were one thing, but an
instrument on Mars has to be absolutely reliable, shock resistant, and
very, very small. Steelie began dealing with nitty-gritty questions of
how to collect a soil sample, how to introduce a small amount of sterile
solvent to dissolve the target molecules, how to excite a fluorescent
signal, and how to relay the information home to Earth, all in a tiny
box. Soon, armed with a million dollars of NASA funding, he planned
to fly the instrument on NASA’s 2013 mission to Mars.
Steelie’s baby is called MASSE—the Microarray Assay for Solar
System Exploration. Adapting the latest in chip writer/chip reader
technology, his team is building both flight-ready and handheld devices that use antibodies to detect trace amounts of dozens of diagnostic biomolecules: hopanes, sterols, DNA, amino acids, a variety of
proteins, even rocket exhaust. Carnegie is not alone in developing such
an instrument, and given the intense competition of other dedicated
design teams, there’s no guarantee that MASSE will ever fly. Steelie is
also competing against a seductive sample-return mission—a technically challenging effort to return a soda can-sized canister of Martian
rock and soil to Earth on the same 2013 mission. Only one instrument
package will be selected. Even if MASSE does fly, there’s no guarantee
that it will arrive safely, and if it does arrive safely that it will find
anything of interest. Of course, Steelie and his group are learning lots
of fascinating stuff along the way. And I’ve never seen scientists have
so much fun.

In our quest to understand life’s emergence, fossils provide essential
clues. Even lacking morphological evidence, fossil elements, isotopes,
and molecules point to the nature of primitive biochemical processes.
These microscopic remains also reveal a diversity of life-supporting
environments and help to constrain the timing of life’s genesis. What’s
more, if we’re lucky, fossils from Mars or some other extraterrestrial
body may eventually provide the best evidence that life has emerged
more than once in the universe.

And yet, valuable as these insights may be, all known fossils represent remains of advanced cellular organisms similar to those alive today. Few, if any, clues remain regarding the emergent biochemical steps
that must have preceded cells. To understand how life arose, therefore,
we must go back to the beginning and approach the question of origins from the bottom up.

Prologue

“Look at this!”
Harold Morowitz beamed as he hustled into my office. “The dielectric constant of water drops to about 20 at a kilobar and 350
degrees. That’s like an organic solvent!” He pulled up a chair to show
me the data.
It took me a moment to change gears and realize what he was so
excited about. Harold and I both teach undergraduate science courses
at George Mason University, where we often discuss biology’s “Big
Questions,” including the chemical processes that might have led to
life’s origin. For more than two decades Harold had puzzled over the
role of water, which poses a persistent problem in origin-of-life scenarios. Water is the medium of life, while carbon, by far the most versatile of all the chemical elements, forms the essential backbone of all
biomolecules. Yet researchers find that several key chemical steps in
assembling life’s carbon-based molecules do not work very well in water. So how could life have started on a wet planet?
One intriguing, though untested, possibility is that life’s initial
chemical reactions proceed more easily at high pressure and temperature. This idea had received a boost in the late 1970s, when Oregon
State University oceanographer Jack Corliss descended to the deep,
dark ocean floor in the research submersible Alvin and observed astonishing ecosystems at undersea volcanic vents. In these hellish zones,
without benefit of sunlight, life has found a way to survive crushing

pressures of 1,000 atmospheres—a kilobar—and scalding temperatures greater than 100°C. Perhaps, Corliss and co-workers suggested,
life first arose at such hostile extremes, and in total darkness.
Morowitz’s dense tabulation held a possible clue. Photocopied
from a 1970s text, it recorded variations of water’s physical and chemical properties with temperature and pressure. Sure enough, at extreme
pressure-cooker conditions water appeared to be a remarkably
different liquid from the stuff that comes out of the tap. Harold was
onto something. “So maybe Jack Corliss is right—maybe it is the vents.”
The mainstream origin-of-life community, wedded as they were
to the tradition of a globe-spanning ocean of “primordial soup”
bathed in sunlight, had rejected this speculation out of hand. In the
intervening two decades, no one had bothered to try the relevant hightemperature and high-pressure experiments. Yet the so-called hydrothermal-origins hypothesis was too intriguing and too testable to disappear. In the late 1980s, the German chemist and patent attorney
Günter Wächtershäuser put flesh on the bones of this idea by proposing a detailed chemical scenario for origin events in a deep hydrothermal zone rich in sulfide minerals.
Now Harold had uncovered data showing how the physical and
chemical properties of water might be very different at extreme conditions from those of everyday experience. Perhaps chemical reactions
that fail at Earth’s ordinary surface conditions could take place at those
extremes. There was only one way to find out.
“So, can you do the experiments?” Harold knew that my nearby
research base, the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory in
Washington, D.C., maintained an arsenal of high-temperature and
high-pressure apparatus. The laboratory specialized in chemical reactions at extreme conditions, so he hoped that my colleagues and I
might be able to tackle the complex carbon chemistry that underpins
the origin of life.
I hardly gave it a second thought. “Sure, why not? It’s an easy experiment.” I had no idea where that hasty promise would lead.

Harold Morowitz is one of the kindest scientists I know. More than a
few scientists wear a veneer of kindness—a pro forma geniality that
masks an intense and often competitive personality. Those of us whose

lives are devoted to indulging our curiosity tend to be a distracted, selfabsorbed lot. Harold is different. He smiles winningly at the slightest
encouragement and speaks with the calmness and quiet passion of a
rabbi or father confessor. He loves a good idea, and shares his richly
inventive vision of life’s origin without hesitation, without the conventional expectation of clever reciprocation. He came to George Mason
University in 1988, after a full and productive career on the biology
faculty at Yale, where he made his mark studying energy flow in cells.
Harold argues persuasively that modern cells carry hints of life’s earliest biochemical processes. Such molecular “fossils” persist in all of us
in all our cells he claims, and these molecules point to the chemistry of
life’s origins. [Plate 1]
Although at the time a novice at origins research, I was delighted
for an excuse to collaborate with Harold Morowitz. His name provided instant credibility in a field at times tarnished by questionable
data, contentious debates, or even outright quackery. Nevertheless, a
successful experiment must be planned with care, and Harold had already spent a lot of time thinking about strategy.
“Let’s start with pyruvate,” he urged. Pyruvate, an energy-rich, 3carbon molecule, was a natural choice for Harold, who had spent a
lifetime studying metabolism, the processes by which cells gather atoms and energy to sustain themselves, grow, and reproduce. Pyruvate
is a key ingredient in every cell’s metabolism. Most cells gain energy by
splitting the 6-carbon sugar, glucose, into two pyruvate molecules, after which the pyruvate is broken into smaller molecules to release further energy. Morowitz explained that some cells also use pyruvate as a
building block to construct larger molecules. So, for example, a pyruvate molecule and a molecule of carbon dioxide (one carbon atom
bonded to two oxygen atoms) can react to form a 4-carbon molecule
called oxaloacetate, which undergoes further reactions in metabolism.
It’s simple math: 3 + 1 = 4. But that reaction never works in water
at room pressure, at least not without a complex biological catalyst—a
molecule that greatly boosts the reaction rate. In the absence of a cell’s
sophisticated catalytic chemical machinery, pyruvate tends to break
down into fragments with only one or two carbon atoms. Perhaps,
Harold suggested, higher pressure and temperature would reverse this
trend and induce pyruvate plus carbon dioxide to form oxaloacetate. If
so—if we could demonstrate that hydrothermal conditions promote
such a key metabolic reaction—then hydrothermal vents would be-

come even more of a focus for the origin of metabolism. Experimentalists dream of such opportunities—a simple experiment with a big
potential payoff.
We agreed on a range of temperatures from 150°C to 300°C and
pressures from 500 to 2,000 atmospheres—conditions relevant to hydrothermal systems at and below Earth’s deep-ocean floor. But achieving such conditions is easier said than done.
It was time to pay Hat Yoder a visit.

Every scientific career rests on the support of colleagues who act as
teachers, collaborators, and employers. In my career, Hatten S. Yoder
Jr. served in all three roles. He is my scientific hero. Burly, handsome,
with big, powerful hands, Hat built his high-pressure lab at Carnegie’s
Geophysical Laboratory from scratch, shortly after returning from action with the Pacific Fleet in World War II. For more than half a century, he maintained this premier facility, working tirelessly in his quest
to understand the origins of rocks. [Plate 1] Even at the age of 75, I
knew he would jump at the chance to try something new.
“What P and T?” he asked.
My response was somewhat sheepish. Hat’s pressure lab was designed to achieve extreme conditions: pressures of 10,000 atmospheres
at more than 1,000°C. Running our proposed experiments at a measly
2,000 atmospheres and 250°C would be like using a blast furnace to
bake a cake. But an experiment is an experiment, and after only the
slightest raising of eyebrows and barely audible “hmmph!” Hat was
ready to go.
High-pressure experiments are not for the faint of heart. Even at
pressures of only a few atmospheres, hot gas can cause a nasty explosion. Your pressure cooker sustains no more than a pressure of 2 atmospheres, your car’s tires less than 3, and both can blow out violently.
Hat’s home-built device, aptly called a pressure bomb, worked at thousands of atmospheres with a volume about the size—and with the same
explosive power—of a stick of TNT. A catastrophic, explosive failure at
those pressures could knock out a corner of the lab building. But no
such worries attached to the pyruvate project.
Our experimental strategy relied on a classic metal-capsule technique for studying chemical reactions at high temperatures and pres-

sures: Simply seal reactants into tiny cylindrical gold tubes about the
size of a large grain of rice. The soft, chemically inert gold crushes
down on the reactants, providing an isolated high-pressure, high-temperature environment.
We crafted our capsules from a cylinder of gold a foot long, like a
precious soda straw. I cut the cylinder into 1-inch lengths and welded
each piece shut at one end. Water and pyruvate, both liquids, loaded
easily into the capsules with a syringe—50 milligrams of water and 3
milligrams of pyruvate, just a droplet. It’s difficult to weld shut a tube
containing a gas, so we adopted an old experimental trick and used a
white powdered chemical called oxalic acid dihydrate, which breaks
down to water plus carbon dioxide above 100°C.
My first attempts at welding the gold tubes shut were a mess. I
weighed and loaded the reactants, crimped shut the tube’s open end,
and placed the gold capsule into a vise, with the crimped end peeking
out above thin steel jaws. A successful weld requires one smooth flick
of the wrist with a carbon-arc welder, a graphite rod the size of a pencil
that carries an intense electrical current. The gold is supposed to melt
and flow, zipping up the capsule in a fraction of a second. But as my
welder heated the gold, a portion of the volatile pyruvate boiled away.
A sudden burp of smelly gas blew an ugly, gaping hole in the weld,
ruining the carefully weighed ratios of reactants. After a lot of trial and
error, I learned to weld one capsule end (using a microscope to see
what I was doing), while the other end was immersed in ultracold liquid nitrogen, a frigid –196°C bath that froze the volatile reactants. The
welder would erupt into blue-white flame and the gold would sputter
and melt, sealing the tube. Eventually my batting average rose above
0.500.

Hat inserted three identical gold capsules into a platinum holder inside a foot-long nickel metal cylinder that would serve as an electric
furnace. Decades of experience streamlined his routine. After the capsules are inserted, load the cylinder with ceramic filler rod, thermocouple wires, and ceramic end cap, and pack it all with a fine, sandlike
powder of white aluminum oxide. Attach that sample assembly to the
“head,” a fat steel plug that holds in pressure while providing insulated
channels for wires that carry electric current for the heater and tem-

perature sensors. Insert the cylinder and head into the massive metal
bomb. Seal the bomb with a giant 6-inch-long nut with a 6-sided head.
Tighten the nut with a 3-foot-long 20-pound wrench; use a 3-footlong pipe as an extension for added torque.
Hat banged away at the unwieldy wrench, making a horrendous
racket as he tightened the nut just a bit more for safety. “It’s always
good to make a lot of noise in the lab,” he said. “That way the director
will know you’re working.”
We retreated behind a wall of battleship gray, war-salvage naval
armor as Hat opened and closed a bewildering sequence of valves to
fill the system with pressurized argon, an inert gas. Ka-chunk, ka-chunk,
ka-chunk! The argon gas compressor pumped the bomb to 2,000 atmospheres in a matter of minutes. Hat set the computerized furnace
controls to ramp the temperature up to 250°C, and we were off. Deep
inside the steel bomb the gold tubes were being crushed and heated to
conditions similar to those found several miles beneath Earth’s surface. In such an extreme environment, the pyruvate was sure to do
something interesting. We went to lunch.
Two hours later, we were back in the high-pressure lab to quench
the run. When the current shut off, the temperature dropped rapidly,
cooling to below 100°C in about a minute or so. Hat released the pressure with a whoosh, unscrewed the big nut, and pulled out the sample
assembly. He dumped the cylinder’s contents into a shallow metal tray:
end cap, thermocouple, filler rod, platinum holder, lots of fine white
sand, and three fat, shiny gold capsules spilled out. Success! The capsules had held! We itched to know what was inside. Two capsules went
into the freezer, while I took the third upstairs for analysis.
There is nothing sophisticated about opening a gold capsule; you
simply snip open one end and pour out the contents. First I washed
the outside of the capsule in organic solvents to avoid any contamination by machine oil or fingerprints. Then I froze it in liquid nitrogen,
so that the contents would not leak out during the snip. I positioned
the capsule over a glass vial to catch the gold and its contents. Just a
little snip . . . usually does the trick. . . . Kapow! The gold weld blasted
off into some remote corner of the lab, propelled by the sudden release of what must have been several atmospheres of internal gas pressure. A bit shaken, I dropped the capsule into the bottom of the vial,
where it lay dormant for a few seconds. But then it began to hiss and
foam as a yellow-brown oily substance frothed out, coating the gold

and the glass. A pungent odor not unlike Jack Daniels permeated
the lab.
The pyruvate had clearly reacted, but it did not look anything like
colorless, odorless oxaloacetate. What had we made?
Time to consult George Cody [Plate 1], a recent arrival at the lab
and an organic geochemist trained to analyze messy, oily stuff. George
is enthusiastic, loquacious, and—luckily for us—he can’t seem to say
no. He is also an expert in the chemistry of coal; he tends to snow
visitors to his office with a blizzard of arcane chemical names and reactions. He thinks out loud and scribbles diagrams of molecules and reactions on any available surface, including the protective windows of
his lab’s chemical hoods. When I showed him the smelly goo, he knew
just what to do.
“GCMS,” he said, “We probably don’t need CI.” I nodded as if I
understood what he was talking about. “Let’s use BF3 propanol as the
derivatizing agent. The Supelco column should work fine.”
He had proposed that we analyze our suite of products by passing
them, together with a chemically inert gas, through a long, thin tube
filled with specially prepared organic molecules. This technique, gas
chromatography (the “GC” of GCMS), separates different molecules
according to how fast they move through the column. In general,
smaller, less reactive molecules move faster than bigger, “sticky” molecules. The gas chromatograph sorts a collection of different molecules
into separate little pulses, typically over a period of 30 or 40 minutes.
Then comes the mass spectrometer (the “MS” of GCMS), which
measures the relative masses of molecules and their fragments.
George’s mass spectrometer blasts molecules into lots of smaller pieces
of distinctive weights, so each pulse from the GC can be analyzed separately as a suite of characteristic mass fragments, providing a kind of
fingerprint of the product molecule.
It took a couple of hours of chemical processing to prepare the
concentrated liquid sample for analysis. George filled a syringe with
the pale yellow liquid and injected a tiny drop into the GCMS with a
practiced, swift motion. We sat back to watch as a spectrum gradually
appeared on the computer monitor. The first peak showed up at 10.79
minutes—a small molecule with probably only two or three carbon
atoms. Then another peak at 11.71 minutes, and another at 11.96.
Faster and faster peaks appeared, piling in on top of each other, every
spike representing additional molecular products. By the 20-minute

mark, a broad hump decorated with hundreds of sharp spikes was
emerging.
“Humpane,” George muttered in disgust. Pyruvate had reacted in
our capsules, to be sure. But instead of the simple 3 + 1 = 4 reaction
that Morowitz had proposed, we had produced an explosion of molecules—tens of thousands of different kinds of molecules. Not a trace
of oxaloacetate was to be found, but a bewildering array of other molecular species had emerged. It might take a lifetime to decipher the
contents of just one such molecular suite.
One conclusion was obvious. Some very dynamic organic reactions proceed rapidly at hydrothermal conditions. In one sense,
Morowitz’s hypothesis had failed: Pyruvate doesn’t react with carbon
dioxide to form oxaloacetate under those conditions. But we had
caught our first glimpse of a robust, emergent carbon chemistry in a
hydrothermal environment. This was chemistry worth exploring.
Where to begin? We were faced with choosing from among thousands of simple carbon-based molecules over a wide range of pressure,
temperature, and other experimental variables—work to devour a
hundred scientific lifetimes.
What were we getting ourselves into?

Terrestrial planet formation

3.1 Introduction
Kant (1755) and Laplace (1796) laid the foundations of our theory of planet
formation, arguing that the Solar System formed in a ﬂattened disk orbiting the Sun.
Today we know such disks to be a part of the star formation process (see Chapter 4),
and we have come a long way toward understanding the details of how a protostellar
disk turns itself into planets. Most importantly, for ten years now we have been
ﬁnding planets orbiting other stars; the current count of detected exoplanets exceeds
180, so that the Solar System now constitutes only a small minority of all known
planets. The bad news is that Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars remain the only
examples of terrestrial planets we know, since such bodies are still well below
the mass threshold for detection around ordinary stars. Thus, apart from a pair
of bodies orbiting the pulsar PSR1257 + 12 (Wolszczan and Frail, 1992), all
known exoplanets are giants: gaseous bodies like Jupiter or Saturn with a couple
of potentially Neptune-like examples recently added to the menagerie. However,
impressive as the ‘king of the planets’ and its kind are, it is a terrestrial planet – a
modest rocky body, three-thousandths Jupiter’s mass – which actually harbours the
life in our Solar System. And as we contemplate the possibility of life elsewhere
in the Universe, it is inevitably upon terrestrial planets that we focus our attention.
It is thus especially important to attempt to understand the process of terrestrial
planet formation, so that even in the absence of direct observations, we can assess
the likelihood of other planets like our own existing around other stars. At the
same time, such work allows us to plan ahead for future terrestrial planet-hunting
missions like KEPLER, COROT, and (if it is resurrected) the Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF).
This chapter gives an overview of the theory of terrestrial planet formation
as it currently stands. We begin with the formation of the basic building blocks,
planetesimals, in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, we look at how protoplanets grow from

the agglomeration of planetesimals. This brings us to the ﬁnal stage of terrestrial
planet formation in Section 3.4, wherein the protoplanets collide to produce
bodies like Earth and Venus. We examine the ‘standard mode’ of how this stage
plays out, together with some more recent variations, as well as the constraints
cosmochemistry places on the the timeline of the Earth’s formation. In Section 3.5,
we summarize the current state of the impact model for the origin of the Earth–Moon
system. In Section 3.6, we consider terrestrial planet formation and evolution from
an astrobiology perspective, including the concept of the habitable zone and the
puzzle posed by the Late Heavy Bombardment. A summary is given in Section 3.7.

3.2 The formation of planetesimals
In the ﬁrst phase of terrestrial planet formation, solids condense out of the
protostellar gas disk as dust grains, settle to the disk midplane, and eventually form
kilometre-sized planetesimals. The actual mechanism of planetesimal formation
remains unclear. Goldreich and Ward (1973) put forward a model in which the
dust layer becomes sufﬁciently thin that it undergoes gravitational instability,
contracting (in the terrestrial region) into kilometre-sized clumps and thus
producing planetesimals directly. However, Weidenschilling (1995) pointed out
that turbulent stirring of the dust layer would likely prevent gravitational instability.
The dust particles are on Keplerian orbits while the gas disk, being partly supported
by its own internal pressure, revolves at slightly less than the Keplerian rate. The
resulting vertical shear in velocity at the dust–gas interface induces turbulence in the
dust layer, preventing it from becoming thin enough for the onset of gravitational
instability.
Because of this problem, the most widely held current view is that dust particles
build planetesimals by pairwise accretion. Laboratory experiments suggest that
growth of dust to centimetre-sized aggregates proceeds quite easily, probably
in 106 y (Paraskov et al. (2005 and references therein). At metre size and larger,
the process is less well understood. For one thing, it is unclear how readily larger
bodies stick together. Turbulent eddies in the gas disk may play a role in bringing
about local particle concentrations (e.g., Barranco and Marcus (2005)). However,
orbital decay due to aerodynamic gas drag from the nebula seems to present a
problem. Due to the sub-Keplerian rotation of the gas, a solid body orbiting with
the disk experiences a headwind, loses energy, and experiences continual orbital
shrinking. Orbital decay rates are peaked for metre-sized bodies; for typical nebula
models, such planetesimals spiral from 1 AU (= astronomical unit, the mean radius
of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, which is 1.5 × 1013 cm) into the central star
on a timescale of order 100 years (Weidenschilling, 1977). Thus, it appears growth
through this size regime must be extremely rapid in order to avoid the loss of all

solids. Another possibility is that ﬂuctuations in nebular gas density, turbulent or
otherwise, may locally stall the migration.

3.3 The growth of protoplanets
Once the solids in the protoplanetary disk are mostly locked up in kilometresized bodies, their interactions become dominated by gravity, and in a sense
the dynamics becomes simpler. We will begin with a qualitative description of
what happens next. The planetesimals are on nearly circular coplanar Keplerian
orbits within the disk, although mutual perturbations induce slight deviations from
this. In terms of orbital elements, the planetesimals’ interactions induce in each
other non-zero orbital eccentricities (thus making neighbouring orbits cross) and
inclinations (thus vertically ‘pufﬁng up’ the disk). Since the self-stirring of the disk
is gravitational, the upper limit to the relative velocities induced in the planetesimals
is the surface escape velocity from the locally largest bodies. Therefore initially,
when two planetesimals collide, they usually do so at an impact velocity low enough
that accretion dominates over shattering. Larger-mass bodies have larger collision
cross-sections, so accretion eventually becomes a runaway process: a relatively
small subset of larger bodies, or protoplanets, grows very rapidly in the disk,
consuming the smaller neighbours. However, runaway growth eventually runs out
of steam when it becomes too successful; once the largest protoplanets are massive
enough to dominate the gravitational stirring of the nearby disk, the feedback for
accretion switches from positive to negative, and larger protoplanets grow more
slowly than smaller ones. Thus neighbouring protoplanets converge toward similar
sizes. For the little planetesimals it is now too late; with the large bodies having
taken over the stirring, they now smash into each other at impact velocities too high
for much accretion to occur, and they are reduced to serving as building material
for the protoplanets. With the population of similar-sized protoplanets now ﬁrmly
in charge, this regime is called oligarchic growth. The protoplanets keep sweeping
up planetesimals, and occasionally two neighbours merge, until there is nothing
but protoplanets left.
We can gain some additional insight from a more quantitative approach. To begin
with, a universally important quantity is the Hill radius (or Hill sphere), which gives
a measure of gravitational reach of a body orbiting a central mass. For a companion
of mass M orbiting a primary of mass M∗ at a distance r, it is deﬁned as


M 1/3
rH =

This is the radius within which a third body (with mass  M ) is able to orbit
around M . Thus a moon must be within its parent planet’s Hill sphere. Of course,

Terrestrial planet formation

this is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition; a would-be satellite approaching a
planet too fast will simply pass through the Hill sphere with some deﬂection, rather
than be captured.
If the relative velocities between neighbouring planetesimals are dispersiondominated – i.e., the main contribution to their relative velocities is their mutual
perturbations, rather than the difference in Keplerian speed between neighbouring
orbits – their growth rate can be estimated using a simple ‘particle in a box’approach
(Lissauer (1993) and references therein):

where ρplsmls is the density with which planetesimals are distributed in the
planetesimal disk, σ is the collisional cross-section of a planetesimal, and vrel
is the average relative velocity between nearby planetesimals. The collisional

As shown by Wetherill and Stewart (1989), planetesimal accretion is subject to
positive feedback, which results in runaway growth: the largest bodies grow the
fastest, rapidly detaching themselves from the size distribution of the planetesimals.
The reason for this can be seen from Equation (3.4): dM /dt ∝ M 4/3 , and so the
growth timescale is
tgrow ≡

M

dM /dt

thus larger bodies grow faster than smaller ones.

3.3 The growth of protoplanets

45

Ida and Makino (1993) showed that runaway growth only operates temporarily;
once the largest protoplanets are massive enough to dominate the gravitational
stirring of the nearby planetesimals, the mode of accretion changes. From this
point on, near a protoplanet of mass M , the planetesimal random velocity is
approximately proportional to the surface escape speed from the protoplanet, and
so v ∝ M 1/3 . Therefore, we now have

which makes

Thus growth becomes orderly; larger bodies grow more slowly, and we have the
onset of oligarchic growth (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). In the terrestrial region, the
transition from runaway to oligarchic growth already happens when the largest
protoplanets are still many orders of magnitude below an Earth mass (Thommes
et al., 2003). As a result, protoplanets spend almost all of their time growing
oligarchically.
As long as nebular gas is present, the random velocity v of the planetesimals
is set by two competing effects: gravitational stirring acts to increase v, while
aerodynamic gas drag acts to reduce it. One can estimate the equilibrium random
velocity by equating the two rates (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). In this way, one can
eliminate v and write the protoplanet growth rate (recall that there is essentially
no more planetesimal–planetesimal growth by this time) in terms of planetesimal
and gas disk properties. Also, for simplicity we approximate the planetesimal
population as having a single characteristic mass m. The result is (for details

Protoplanet growth by sweep-up of planetesimals ceases when all planetesimals
are gone. This leads to the notion of the isolation mass, which is the mass at which a
protoplanet has consumed all planetesimals within an annulus of width brH centred
on its orbital radius. The isolation mass is given by

falloff in the density of planetesimals. For any shallower surface density proﬁle,
Miso increases with r.
In order to obtain values for protoplanet accretion times and ﬁnal masses, a
useful starting point is the ‘minimum-mass Solar Nebula’(MMSN) model (Hayashi,
1981), which is obtained by ‘smearing out’ the refractory elements contained in the
Solar System planets into a power-law planetesimal disk, then adding gas to obtain

Since the exponent of the surface density power law is greater than −2, we know
from Equation (3.10) that the isolation mass will increase with distance from the
star (though from Equation (3.8), the time to ﬁnish growing also increases with r).
Using Equation (3.10) with b = 10, the MMSN yields an isolation mass of 0.07

mass of 10−12 M⊕ ), the growth timescale for an isolation-mass body at 1 AU is
tgrow ≡ M /(dM /dt) ≈ 6 × 104 y. Thus, the sweep-up of planetesimals into
protoplanets proceeds very rapidly in the terrestrial region, concluding long before
the nebular gas dissipates, which takes a few million years (Haisch et al., 2001).
Figure 3.1 plots the solution to Equation (3.8) at different times, showing the
progression of protoplanet growth through the terrestrial region during the ﬁrst
million years of the disk’s lifetime.

3.4 The growth of planets
With the protoplanets (or ‘oligarchs’) now starved of planetesimals, the ﬁnal stage
of terrestrial planet formation requires them to agglomerate with one another.
For this to happen, their orbits have to cross. This is referred to as the giantimpact (or chaotic) phase. We will begin with a description of how this unfolds
in the ‘standard model’, and then touch on some more recent efforts to tie up the
loose ends.
Traditionally, N -body simulations have been the tool of choice for characterizing
the giant-impact phase. The problem is particularly well suited to this approach,
because once all the planetesimals have been locked up in perhaps tens to hundreds
of protoplanets, N is no longer an intractably large number. The ﬁrst direct N -body
calculations (Cox and Lewis, 1980; Lecar and Aarseth, 1986) revealed a number of
key features of the giant-impact phase. They showed that an ensemble of lunar-to

Terrestrial planet formation

Martian-sized bodies, allowed to agglomerate with one another in collisions,
naturally formed Solar-System-like terrestrial planets. They also demonstrated that
this process is highly stochastic. Because only a few bodies remain at the end,
in any single simulation the notion of a characteristic planet mass as a function of
distance from the star becomes meaningless, and the approach we use in Section 3.3
can no longer be applied.
Taken together, the work of Chambers and Wetherill (1998), Agnor et al. (1999),
and Chambers (2001) can be said to delineate the ‘standard model’ of how the
ﬁnal stage of terrestrial planet formation plays out: simulations begin with a
population of 102 –103 lunar- to-Martian-sized protoplanets, the endproducts of
the previous oligarchic growth phase. Different realizations of a particular initial
condition typically vary only by the (randomly-generated) initial orbital phases of
the protoplanets; the stochastic nature of these systems ensures that this is enough
to make the details of the evolution completely different from one simulation to
the next. Nevertheless, averaging over enough simulations, a number of common
features emerge. On a timescale of ∼(1–3) × 108 years, these bodies collide with
each other and accrete to form planetary systems which, on average, resemble the
Solar System’s terrestrial planets in mass, number, and orbital radius. Mercury and
Mars, given their small sizes, seem to ﬁt into the picture as essentially primordial
oligarchs that managed to come through the whole process without undergoing
any major accretional collisions. The spin of each endproduct is dominated by
the last few major impacts on it, and to lowest order is randomly oriented. This
contrasts with the present-day Solar System, in which all terrestrial planet spins are
approximately perpendicular to their orbital plane. However, the obliquities of the
terrestrial planets have evolved signiﬁcantly by processes such as tidal interactions
and spin–orbit coupling, thus their spins are unlikely to be primordial. A more
puzzling issue is that of the ﬁnal orbital eccentricities and inclinations. Their timeaveraged values are almost universally larger (e, i  0.1, for i in radians) than
those of Earth and Venus today (e, i ≈ 0.03) (Chambers and Wetherill, 1998;
Nagasawa et al., 2006).
Because numerical models of late-stage terrestrial planet formation are otherwise
so successful, the problem of reproducing the low e and i of Earth and Venus has
been the subject of much effort; it really is a case of ‘so close and yet so far!’
Considering that we are demanding that the terrestrial region evolve directly from
wildly crossing orbits and giant impacts, to a very quiescent state of nearly circular,
coplanar orbits, this failure is not really surprising. In the most general terms, to
solve this problem an additional, dissipative physical process must be invoked,
which will damp away the planets’ non-circular motions. A number of different
mechanisms have been put forth and, as yet, nothing approaching a consensus
has been reached among theorists. Below, we look at three proposed models.

3.4 The growth of planets

49

Perhaps the most obvious candidate is the planets’ own leftover building
material. If a signiﬁcant mass in planetesimals is left in the system, this can exert
dynamical friction on the planets (e.g., Wetherill and Stewart (1989)): a population
of gravitationally interacting bodies with different masses evolves toward a state
where the energy in random velocities (relative to circular Keplerian orbits; see
Section 3.3) is the same for all bodies, regardless of mass. This makes smaller
bodies gain eccentricity and inclination at the expense of the larger ones, so that the
latter have their e and i damped. The problem is that the timescale for sweeping up
the planetesimals is, as we saw in Section 3.3, only ∼105 years. Thus, a signiﬁcant
reservoir of planetesimals is unlikely to persist long enough to affect the dynamics
after 108 years or more. Alternatively, a large number of small bodies, right down
to dust size, may be generated collisionally during the planet growth process
(Goldreich et al., 2004).
As long as the nebular gas persists, it also acts as a source of damping for
protoplanet eccentricities and inclinations. Though bodies larger than kilometre size
are not strongly affected by aerodynamic gas drag, their gravitational interaction
with the gas disk can have a signiﬁcant effect on them. Each planet launches density
waves into the interior and exterior part of the disk, exchanging energy and angular
momentum with it. The net result is that planets migrate inward while having their
eccentricities damped (Goldreich and Tremaine, 1980; Artymowicz, 1993; Ward,
1997; Papaloizou and Larwood, 2000). The approximate orbital and eccentricity
decay timescales for a planet of mass M orbiting a star of mass M∗ with initial

Terrestrial planet formation

of ∼7 × 105 y, and has its eccentricity damped on a timescale of ∼2 × 104 y.
Because of this difference in timescales, even when the gas disk has become so
tenuous that only very little planet migration is occurring, the planets can still be
subject to signiﬁcant eccentricity damping.
Kominami and Ida (2002, 2004) performed simulations of this scenario. They
found, ﬁrst of all, that the giant-impact stage tends to be delayed until the
gas is strongly depleted, such that te  106 y, approximately the crossing
time for adjacent oligarchs. Therefore in this scenario, the terrestrial region is
essentially frozen in the end state of oligarchic growth until the gas disk is tenuous
enough that dynamical evolution can resume. Kominami and Ida demonstrated
that low ﬁnal eccentricities of Earth and Venus analogues can be generated in
this way, but ﬁne tuning of the disk properties, speciﬁcally the gas dispersal
time, is required. Even then, on average six–seven bodies are left in the end,
signiﬁcantly more than the present-day number of Solar System terrestrial planets.
The fundamental problem is that making the oligarchs’ orbits cross and damping
their eccentricities are two conﬂicting objectives. Also, they found that including
the gravitational perturbations on the terrestrial region due to Jupiter and Saturn
tended to make the model work more poorly (in the sense that eccentricities and
inclinations became higher), leading them to speculate that the terrestrial planets
might have formed at a time when Jupiter and Saturn had not yet reached their
ﬁnal masses.
Nagasawa et al. (2005) (see also Nagasawa et al. (2006)) developed a model
for late-stage terrestrial planet formation via a large-scale dynamical shakeup.
The model likewise hinges on the dissipating gas disk; however, it also includes
the effect of the gas disk on the precession of all the embedded orbits, with the
result that things play out in a dramatically different way. This is due to the effect
of a secular resonance of Jupiter, a detailed discussion of secular resonances is
given in, e.g., Murray and Dermott (1999). Here, we will restrict ourselves to a
simpliﬁed, qualitative description: A secular resonance between two bodies occurs
(approximately) when the precession frequencies of their orbits are equal. In this
case, we are looking at the precession rate of terrestrial oligarchs relative to that of
Jupiter. The former precess due to the gravitational inﬂuence of the gas disk, Jupiter,
Saturn and, to a lesser extent, each other. Jupiter, meanwhile, is made to precess
by the inﬂuence of Saturn and the gas disk, as well as a small contribution from
the protoplanets themselves. When a given oligarch’s precession matches that of
Jupiter and a resonance occurs, a rapid exchange of angular momentum takes place
between the two bodies. Being much more massive, Jupiter’s orbit undergoes little
change. The orbit of the small protoplanet, however, rapidly gains eccentricity. For
a given gas disk density distribution, there is one particular orbital radius interior
(and exterior, though this plays no role in the model) to Jupiter at which a body

will be in secular resonance. As the gas disk dissipates (through a combination
of accreting onto the star, photoevaporation, and stripping by stellar winds), its
gravitational potential changes and so too do the precession rates of the embedded
(proto)planets and thus the location of the interior secular resonance. The resonance
begins near Jupiter in a massive gas disk, ﬁnally ending up – once the gas is all
gone – at its present-day location at 0.6 AU, just inside the current orbit of Venus
(Lecar and Franklin, 1997; Nagasawa and Ida, 2000). Along the way it thus sweeps
the asteroid belt and much of the terrestrial region and one after another the oligarchs
have their eccentricity sharply raised, thus crossing their neighbours’ orbits. In this
way, the giant-impact phase is kick-started when there is still a signiﬁcant amount
of gas left in the disk. Nagasawa et al. (2005) performed numerical simulations of
this process and found that accretion among oligarchs can ﬁnish rapidly in this way,
leaving enough time for the last remnants of the gas disk to damp the eccentricities
and inclinations of the end products. Another effect in evidence is a net inward
migration of material during the resonance sweeping process, since bodies forced
to high eccentricities in the presence of a damping force lose orbital energy as their
eccentricity is damped again, thus spiralling inward (Lecar and Franklin, 1997). This
offers a way to both clear the asteroid belt region (which is highly depleted relative
to even the MMSN planetesimal disk) and deliver water-rich building material for
the Earth (see Section 3.6).
Parent–daughter pairs of radioactive isotopes can be exploited as chronometers
to trace the timelines of processes in the early Solar System, potentially helping
us to decide among the different formation models. Two such pairs are Hf–W
and U–Pb. For both of these, the parent element is a lithophile that is retained
in silicate reservoirs during planetary accretion, whereas the daughter element is
segregated into the core. Since each of the large late-stage impacts would ‘reset
the clock’ by remixing core and mantle, measurements of relative abundances of
these elements in the Earth can be used to estimate how long ago the giant-impact
phase concluded. It is thought that the last impact was the Moon-forming one
(see Section 3.5). Measurements of Hf–W have been used to derive a growth time
of the Earth ranging from about 15 to 50 My (Yin et al., 2002; Kleine et al., 2002;
Wood and Halliday, 2005), intriguingly similar to the short timescales obtained by
Nagasawa et al. (2005). However, the U–Pb chronometer implies a later formation
time, ∼65–85 My (Halliday, 2004). It may be that U–Pb traces the last stages of
core segregation, while Hf–W traces the time for most of the core to ﬁnish forming
(Sasaki and Abe, 2005). Given the difﬁcult nature of these measurements, it should
not be surprising that the different groups’ results have still not been completely
reconciled with each other. Future developments in this area may yet allow us to
determine with some certainty whether the formation of the terrestrial planets was
rapid or drawn out.

Terrestrial planet formation

3.5 The origin of the Earth–Moon system
The leading model for the formation of the Moon is that a Mars-mass impactor
struck the proto-Earth, with the Moon accreting out of the resulting debris disk
(Hartmann and Davis, 1975; Cameron and Ward, 1976). This scenario naturally
results in a Moon depleted in volatiles and iron-poor (since the impact would have
preferentially splashed out mantle material from the proto-Earth). The giant-impact
model was explored further via a succession of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) simulations, greatly increasing over time in resolution as computing power
advanced (Benz et al., 1986; Cameron and Benz, 1991; Canup and Asphaug, 2001;
Canup, 2004). As mentioned in Section 3.4, this impact is thought to have been the
last major accretion event in the Earth’s history.
The latest simulations reproduce the Earth–Moon system best with an impactor
just over 0.1 M⊕ striking proto-Earth at about a 45◦ angle. This ejects about a
lunar mass of material exterior to Earth’s Roche radius (the distance inside which
a strengthless, self-gravitating body would be disrupted by Earth’s tidal forces) at
about 3 Earth radii (R⊕ ). The vast majority of this material comes from the impactor
itself. Initially, 10–30% of it is in the form of silicate vapour. The orbital period at the
Roche radius is only about 7 hours, thus subsequent evolution is very fast. Ida et al.
(1997) simulated the accretion of the Moon in the protolunar disk, showing that it
takes between a month and a year to get to a single remaining lunar-mass body. The
Moon’s current orbital radius is ≈ 60 R⊕ , thus its orbit has expanded signiﬁcantly
from the time it formed. This is effected by the Moon’s tidal interaction with the
Earth, which transfers angular momentum from the Earth’s spin to the Moon’s orbit.
Early on, interaction with the last remnants of the protolunar disk likely also made
a large contribution to the outward migration of the Moon (Ward and Canup, 2000).
It has been suggested that the Moon may have actually aided the development
of life on Earth (Benn (2001) and references therein): the Moon stabilizes the
Earth against chaotic obliquity variations, and thus against large variations in
climate. Also, without the Moon-forming impact, Earth may have retained its thick
primordial atmosphere and ended up more similar to Venus. Finally, a more closelyorbiting early Moon would have raised substantial tides on the Earth’s surface,
which may have aided the formation of life in tidal pools.

3.6 Terrestrial planets and life
The term ‘habitable zone’ (HZ) goes back to Huang (1959). The criteria adopted for
what constitutes a potentially life-supporting planet have varied widely. The most
durable has proven to be simply the requirement that liquid water can exist on the
planet surface (Rasool and de Bergh, 1970; Kasting et al., 1988). In fact, ‘Follow

the water!’ has become one of the guiding principles of astrobiology. Kasting et al.
(1993) used a climate model to calculate this zone for stars later than F0, which
have lifetimes exceeding 2 Gy, thus giving life ample time to evolve. The inner edge
of the HZ is set by water loss via photolysis and hydrogen escape; the outer edge
is set by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet by raising its albedo.
For G stars like the Sun, Kasting et al. (1993) conservatively estimated that the
HZ stretches from 0.95 to 1.37 AU. F stars, being hotter, have a more distant HZ,
while later type stars have a closer-in HZ (their Fig. 16). They point out that the
logarithmic width of HZs is approximately constant across stellar types. This is
signiﬁcant because the spacing between adjacent planets ought to be set at least
in part by their Hill radii; since rH ∝ r (Equation (3.1)) this implies (for a given
planetary mass) logarithmic spacing. Thus, the number of planets which ﬁt into an
HZ can be expected to be very roughly constant across stellar types. However, the
closer-in HZ of later type stars does lead to a potential obstacle to life: for M type
stars, planets in the HZ will become tidally locked into synchronous rotation with
the central star over a time less than the star’s age. The resultant eternally-dark
planetary hemisphere would likely be frozen and uninhabitable.
Water is the basis of life on Earth, but tracing the origin of the Earth’s water
is also central to understanding terrestrial planet formation. Most models of the
protosolar nebula have too high a temperature at 1 AU for water to condense
out of the gas (Nagasawa et al. (2006) and references therein). Hence, models of
terrestrial planet formation generally invoke a way to deliver water from reservoirs
at larger heliocentric distances. This idea is supported by the deuterium to hydrogen
(D/H) ratio of the Earth’s oceans, which is many times higher than expected in the
protosolar nebula at 1 AU. Still uncertain is what fraction of such material came
from the asteroid belt (e.g., Morbidelli et al. (2000)) vs the trans-Jupiter region
(e.g., Levison et al. (2001), Lunine et al. (2003), Raymond et al. (2004), Gomes et al.
(2005)), i.e., ‘wet asteroids’ vs comets. Observational evidence appears to favour
the asteroid belt, since the D/H ratio of carbonaceous chondrites is closer to that of
the Earth’s oceans than is that of comets (Balsiger et al., 1995; Meier et al., 1998;
Bockelee-Morvan et al., 1998; Dauphas et al., 2000; Drake and Righter, 2002).
One way to systematically deliver large amounts of icy material from beyond the
snow line to the terrestrial region is via the late-stage formation model of Nagasawa
et al. (2005) outlined in Section 3.4.
The cratering record on the Moon seems to suggest a spike in the impact rate about
700 My after the formation of the Solar System (e.g., Hartmann et al. (2000)). This
cataclysmic event in our early history turns out to be a puzzle from the point of view
of both celestial mechanics and the origin of life. Insofar as the latter is concerned,
there exists some (controversial) carbon isotopic evidence for the existence of life
3.7–3.85 Gy ago (Wells et al. (2003) and references therein), right around the time

Terrestrial planet formation

of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). This is surprising since the LHB is likely
to have sterilized the entire Earth (Sleep et al., 1989). One explanation put forward
by Maher and Stevenson (1988) is that around this time, life might simply have
arisen repeatedly and on fairly short timescales, only to be continuously frustrated
by catastrophic impacts. Thus as soon as the impacts ceased, life arose one last time
and took hold. Another possibility is that life found a way to weather the impacts,
either deep underground or in impact ejecta (Sleep et al., 1998). Such ejecta may
even have seeded life elsewhere in the Solar System, such as Mars – a sort of cosmic
enactment of not having all the eggs in one basket.
From a dynamics point of view, the timing of the LHB has also been the cause
of much study and speculation. As discussed in Section 3.3, the sweep-up of
planetesimals in the terrestrial region proceeds on a timescale well below a million
years. Where, then, do all the impactors for the LHB come from? Several different
scenarios have been proposed. Zappala et al. (1998) suggested the breakup of an
asteroid; however, to provide enough material for the LHB, the asteroid’s size must
have been an order of magnitude greater than Ceres (which, with a diameter of
950 km, is the largest body in the asteroid belt today). Chambers and Lissauer
(2002) showed that an extra planet beyond Mars, perhaps around 2 AU, could
have been the culprit. Such a planet could have become unstable on a 700 My
timescale, become eccentric, and crossed as-yet undepleted planetesimal reservoirs
in the inner asteroid belt. These planetesimals would then have been perturbed
onto orbits crossing the terrestrial region. The chief difﬁculty lies in preserving a
signiﬁcant planetesimal population between 2 AU and Jupiter for this length of
time. Finally, Gomes et al. (2005) devised a model in which the LHB is triggered
directly by Jupiter and Saturn. The giant planets almost certainly underwent a
period of gradual, divergent migration as they exchanged angular momentum via
the scattering of planetesimals (Fernández and Ip, 1996; Hahn and Malhotra, 1999).
Gomes et al. (2005) posited an initially compact conﬁguration for the giant planets,
with Uranus and Neptune between 11 and 15 AU, and Jupiter and Saturn just inside
their 1:2 mean-motion resonance. As the planetesimals are scattered back and forth
among the giant planets they migrate apart, and at the moment when Jupiter and
Saturn cross their 1:2 resonance divergently, both receive a kick in eccentricity,
as previously shown by Chiang et al. (2002). This excitation, then, serves as the
trigger for the LHB, delivering a large ﬂux of planetesimals from the outer disk
onto orbits that cross the terrestrial region. To a lesser extent, material remaining
in the asteroid belt may also participate.
The trick is to make this event happen so late; Gomes et al. (2005) showed
that the timing of the migration can be controlled by the distance between the
outermost giant planet and the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. Since many
planetesimals will have already been accreted or scattered during the giant planets’

formation, a distance of more than 1 AU between the giant planets and the inner
disk edge, as in their best-ﬁt model, is not implausible. However, although this
model constitutes a clever way to obtain an essentially arbitrarily long evolution
followed by a cataclysm, the initial locations of the giant planets need to be rather
ﬁnely tuned, without any obvious cosmogonical justiﬁcation.
In Section 3.4, we looked at one way in which the formation process of terrestrial
planets in the Solar System may have been driven by the dynamical inﬂuence of
Jupiter and Saturn. We now consider other, more general, ways in which giant
planets may affect terrestrial planets, with an emphasis on the issue of habitability.
While Section 3.4 describes a scenario in which the giant planets may help
terrestrial planet formation, it is just as possible for giant planets to hinder the
formation of terrestrial planets. In a mature planetary system, the existence of
a Jovian planet in or near the HZ will make it unlikely terrestrial planets will
have survived in the same region. Even a stable HZ is no guarantee of a friendly
environment for terrestrial planets. During the lifetime of the gas disk in the ﬁrst
few million years, substantial migration of planets, especially giant planets, is likely
to occur due to gravitational planet–disk interactions (Goldreich and Tremaine,
1980; Lin and Papaloizou, 1986; Ward, 1997). Numerous gas giants planets may
in fact be lost during this time by migrating inside a disk gap (‘Type II’ migration)
all the way into the central star (Trilling et al., 2002). If gas giants form by
core accretion (Pollack et al., 1996), growing giant planet cores, ∼10 M⊕ in
mass, likely migrate even faster than gas giants, so that even a system in which
no gas giant ever penetrates the terrestrial region may suffer an early period of
being repeatedly transited by Neptune-sized bodies (Thommes and Murray, 2006).
Dynamical studies do suggest, though, that even under such adverse conditions,
some fraction of the (proto)planets in the terrestrial region can survive (Mandell
and Sigurdsson, 2003; Fogg and Nelson, 2005). Finally, it is worth mentioning that
even in systems where a gas giant ends up right in the HZ, biology may have another
recourse: if the giant has one or more large moons, these may provide a suitable
setting for life to arise. Laughlin et al. (2004) argued that the formation of gas
giants ought to be unlikely around low-mass M dwarfs. They assumed that the disk
mass scales with the stellar mass; this would make for a longer growth timescale
and a lower ﬁnal mass for planets grown about such stars (M ≤ 0.4 M ). If gas
giants grow by core accretion, this makes it less likely that cores of large enough
mass to accrete the requisite massive gas envelope will grow within the time that
the gas disk persists, 10 My (GJ 876, M∗ = 0.3 M , orbited by two planets with
M sin i = 0.6 MJup and 1.9 MJup , is a notable counterexample). However, growing
a terrestrial planet is a much less demanding proposition, and effectively the only
time limit is the age of the system. Thus terrestrial planets ought to still be common
around M dwarfs. In fact, with fewer gas giants to threaten their stability, it is

Terrestrial planet formation

conceivable that terrestrial planets are actually more common on average around
lower-mass stars. Since M dwarfs are by far the most common stars, making up
about 70% by number of the stars in the Galaxy, the total number of HZ-dwelling
terrestrial planets is potentially very high.
Although a system with no giant planets at all may be a safer haven for terrestrial
planet formation and survival, a lack of gas giants may negatively impact the
habitability of the planets which do form, even those that end up in their respective
HZ. In the Solar System, Jupiter intercepts a large fraction of the comet ﬂux which
would otherwise cross the terrestrial region. It is thus often argued that without
such a dynamical barrier, life would never have arisen and survived on our planet,
and that a gas giant exterior to the HZ is an additional necessary condition for
habitability. However, the issue is perhaps not quite as clear-cut as it appears at ﬁrst
glance; after all, Jupiter’s perturbations also play a large role in producing shortperiod comets from the Kuiper belt and long-period comets from the Oort cloud
in the ﬁrst place. In fact, outward scattering of planetesimals by Jupiter plays the
main role in actually building the Oort cloud (Duncan et al., 1987). Quantifying the
difference in comet ﬂux into the HZ of a mature planetary system with and without
exterior gas giants is thus an important area for future work, and one which needs
to be undertaken before we can properly assess the potential for low-mass stars to
harbour life.

3.7 Summary
From the theorist’s perspective of how terrestrial planets form, perhaps the most
important aspect is that it seems to be relatively easy, much more so than making
giant planets. Numerical simulations have no problem producing such bodies in
the inner 1–2 AU of a system. Assuming a disk manages to produce planetesimals
(notwithstanding the problems outlined in Section 3.2), their sweep-up proceeds
rapidly in the terrestrial region, taking typically much less than 1 My. The simplest
scenario, in which the resultant protoplanets then interact and collide in a gasfree environment, results in the formation of Earth-mass planets on a timescale
of ∼108 y for a ‘minimum-mass’ distribution of solid material, i.e., one which
begins with essentially just the mass of the present-day terrestrial planets. This
is because planet formation in the inner few astronomical units is very efﬁcient;
with no systematic migration, almost all of the mass one puts in is built into
planets. Thus terrestrial planet formation is fundamentally a very robust process,
so much so that it may actually be difﬁcult to prevent it from happening in any
given system.
This being said, there are still a number of questions about the details of how
terrestrial planets grew in the Solar System and, by extension, how they form

around other stars. The low eccentricities of Earth and Venus seem to require
processes beyond the standard model. It is certainly possible that these low
eccentricities will turn out to be a peculiarity of the Solar System; eccentricities
< 0.1 are not in general necessary for long-term stability. Neither are they
required for habitability. However, this ‘small detail’ may in fact be pointing to
a fundamentally different course of events in the last stage of formation, such as
the secular-resonance ‘shakeup’ model outlined in Section 3.4. Another puzzle is
the nature of the LHB. What initiated it? Did life survive this event, or did it have
to wait until the end of the LHB to arise? How likely are analogues to the LHB
in other planetary systems? The probable ubiquity of terrestrial planet formation
means that any given star ought to have a good chance of harbouring one in its
HZ. This prospect may be ruined if a giant planet exists close enough to the HZ to
destabilize bodies within it.At the same time, though, the presence of (exterior) giant
planets may be required in order to protect the HZ against comet bombardment.
The HZ is deﬁned by the presence of liquid surface water, but the source of that
water is itself still not fully understood.
The discovery of the ﬁrst extrasolar terrestrial planet will certainly be a
momentous event. Until then, no amount of modelling can change the fact that
our sample size of terrestrial planet systems is one. As with the gas giants,
surprises may await which overturn our currently-held picture of how such
planets form. And, of course, the search for exo-terrestrial planets is made
especially exciting by the possibility that another life-bearing world is waiting to be
discovered.

From protoplanetary disks to prebiotic amino

4.1 Introduction
The robust formation of planets as well as abundant sources of water and organic
molecules are likely to be important prerequisites for the wide-spread appearance
of life in the cosmos. The nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace was the ﬁrst
to propose that the formation of planets occurs in gaseous disks around stars.
The construction of new infrared and submillimetre observatories over the last
decade and a half has resulted in the discovery of protoplanetary discs around
most, if not all, forming stars regardless of their mass (e.g., reviews by Meyer et al.
(2006), Dutrey et al. (2006)). The recent discoveries of extrasolar planets in over
a hundred planetary systems provides good evidence that Jovian planets, at least,
may be relatively abundant around solar-like stars (see Chapter 1). These results
beg the question of whether protoplanetary disks are also natural settings for the
manufacture of the molecular prerequisites for life. Life requires water and organic
molecules such as amino acids, sugars, nucleobases, and lipids as building blocks
out of which biological macromolecules and cellular structures are made, and many
of these can be manufactured in protoplanetary disks.
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter we review the properties of protoplanetary disks
and how planets are believed to form within them. We then consider the evidence
that these disks may be a major source of the water and biomolecules available
for the earliest life, as on the Earth. We focus on amino acids because they
are the key components of proteins and more is known about prebiotic synthesis
of amino acids than most other biomolecules. In the second part of this review,
we compare the different environments that have been proposed for amino acid
synthesis – including the atmosphere, hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean, and
protoplanetary disks – and show that there is considerable consensus on which
amino acids can be formed prebiotically, even if there is still disagreement on the
location.

4.2 Protoplanetary disks and the formation of planet systems

We will argue that the amino acids that were least thermodynamically costly
to form were the ones that were most abundant before life arose. Early organisms
could make use of existing amino acids in the ﬁrst proteins. Later organisms evolved
biochemical pathways to synthesize additional amino acids that were not common
prebiotically, thus increasing the diversity and functional speciﬁcity of the proteins
they could make.
The synthesis of speciﬁc proteins is only possible after the origin of the genetic
code (i.e., the mapping between codons in RNA and amino acids in proteins). We
will discuss the origin of the genetic code in the context of our understanding
of prebiotic amino acid frequencies. We will also consider the evidence that the
genetic code is optimized to reduce translational error and discuss how it came to be
this way.
It is likely that early proteins were composed of a smaller set of amino
acids than the 20 used currently. We will discuss several experimental studies
of proteins composed of deliberately reduced amino acid sets that indicate that
properly folded and functional structures could have formed in such proteins.
Bioinformatics techniques can also be used to make predictions about early proteins.
For example, using molecular phylogenetics it is possible to estimate the most likely
ancestral sequence for a given set of related proteins. Several studies indicate that
the abundances of amino acids in the ancestral proteins differed from average
abundances in modern organisms. It is possible that this is a relic of a time when
only a subset of amino acids was used.

4.2 Protoplanetary disks and the formation of planet systems
Stars and planets form within dense, cold clouds of gas and dust, known as molecular
clouds. Surveys of many molecular clouds show that most stars form as members of
entire star clusters. These stellar nurseries arise from dense regions within molecular
clouds known as clumps which extend over about 1 pc in physical scale (or about
3 light years, or 205 000 astronomical units – AU – where 1 AU = 1.5 × 1013
cm is the distance between the Earth and the Sun) and typical initial temperatures
around 20 K. The gas in clouds and clumps is stirred vigorously by supersonic
turbulence which also generates its ﬁlamentary structure. A single star, or a binary
stellar system, forms within a small, dense subregion of a clump (known as a core)
that, for stars like the Sun, extends over a scale of 0.04 pc and has a (particle)
number density ranging from 104 to 108 cm−3 .
Numerical simulations of supersonic turbulent gas under the observed conditions
show how stars and their protoplanetary disks form. Supersonic turbulence ﬁrst
sweeps up the gas into systems of shocked sheets and ﬁlaments. Dense core-like
regions are produced as such ﬂows develop. Also, the shock waves that produce

the cores are oblique and hence impart spin to the cores (see MacLow and Klessen
(2004) for a review). The eventual gravitational collapse of such slowly spinning
cores under their own weight preserves most of their angular momentum, resulting
in the formation of protoplanetary disks (e.g., Tilley and Pudritz (2004)).
Surveys of star-forming regions have established that disks are universal around
solar mass stars. Stars range over more than three decades in mass, and for all of
them, one has evidence for disks. The least massive of these is the disk around
an object that has only 15 MJ (Jovian masses)! (Note, the mass of Jupiter is one
thousandth the mass of the sun; MJ = 0.001 M .) Disks are commonly observed
around solar-like stars as they form. At the most massive end, rotating disks have
been found around B stars that are up to 10 M (e.g., Schreyer et al. (2005)).
Most studies generally do not resolve a disk around a star but infer its presence
from the excess of infrared emission that is seen in the spectrum of the star. Disks
around forming solar-type stars typically extend out to more than 100 AU, with the
temperature varying as a function of the radius r. In our Solar System, the orbital
radius of the Earth around the Sun is 1 AU, while that of the most massive outer
planet, Neptune, is 30 AU. The total emission from this collection of rings of gas
and dust, each of which emits radiation like a blackbody, adds up to the observed
excess infrared emission (known as the spectral energy distribution or SED).
For solar-type stars, the disk temperature that can be inferred from such
observations scales with disk radius as T ∝ r −0.6 , with a temperature at 100 AU of
about 30 K. Similarly, one can deduce that the column density of the disk (which
is the volume density integrated over the disk thickness at a given radius) varies as
 ∝ r −1.5 and has a value at 100 AU of 0.8 g cm−2 . Disks seen at these later stages
of their evolution are far less massive than are their central stars, having typically
10−2 M of gas and dust (e.g., Dutrey et al. (2006)). Hence, their dynamics are
governed by the gravitational ﬁeld of the central star, and the material is expected
√
to be in nearly Keplerian orbit about the star (i.e., vKep (r) = (GM∗ /r)).
Occasionally, one can also spatially resolve the disk around a young star. The
rotation curves of the disks can be measured under such conditions, as has been
done in molecular observations (Simon et al., 2000), and these have been found to
be nearly Keplerian. At a slightly later stage (a few hundred thousand years), after
the surrounding cloud is blown away by the young massive star, stars and their
disks still in formation can be seen in optical images. This is seen in the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) image in Figure 4.1, where we see several images of young
stars that are forming in the Orion Nebula Cluster. A massive star has created a
strongly illuminated background of glowing nebular gas. The HST image shows
a disk around each young star which is seen as a silhouette against this bright
background (McCaughrean and Stauffer, 1994). Disks are heated primarily by the
young star that they surround as well as by a massive nearby star in the case of

clustered star formation. They are also illuminated by ultraviolet radiation as well
as X-rays from the central star, and this drives the production of organic molecules
(as we discuss in the next section).
Studies of the frequency of disks in Orion also allow us to determine their
lifetimes. One can calibrate the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks because one can
measure the ages of the young stars that they encompass. The result is that 50% of
disks are gone by 3 million years after formation, and 90% are gone by 5 million
years. This lifetime for disks translates into a hard upper limit for the time for the
formation of massive Jovian planets. While Jupiter has an 8–10 Earth mass core,

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

its bulk consists of gas that was accreted from the protoplanetary disk in which it
formed.
The building of planets and molecules depends, in part, on the balance between
carbon and oxygen in the molecular gas within protoplanetary disks (e.g., Gaidos
and Selsis (2006)). These two elements are the most abundant in the interstellar
medium after hydrogen and helium and are predominantly bound in the form of
CO in molecular clouds. During gravitational collapse, however, the presence of
high pressure can shift this balance in favour of the formation of water and methane
(CH4 ) from CO and molecular hydrogen. Thus, if there is an excess of O over C,
then the extra O is taken up in the formation of water (through combination with
abundant molecular hydrogen). In the converse case, an excess of C over O is used
up in the formation of graphite and organic molecules. The balance between C and
O depends on the condensation and sedimentation of grains.
While the bulk of the mass of disks is dominated by gas, dust grains play several
important roles. Dust grains in more diffuse gas consist of a mixture of silicates
and carbon, with sizes ranging typically from 100 Å to 0.2–0.3 µm. Once dust
starts to collect in denser environments such as protostellar disks, it grows by
agglomeration via collisions. This growth continues up to the scale of kilometresized objects (called planetesimals) and, eventually, planets. Dust grains, while still
small, are the dominant form of opacity in protostellar disks and effectively absorb
the ultraviolet radiation that falls on disks from their central and surrounding stars
(e.g., Natta et al. (2006)).
Models of terrestrial planet formation agree that the process starts as dust
settles onto the midplane of protoplanetary disks (see Chapter 3). In the earliest
phases, dust grains condense and grow by collisions with other dust grains,
gradually settling to the disk midplane as they become more massive. After
the formation of planetesimals, an ‘oligarchic’ growth phase occurs wherein
gravitational interactions lead to focusing of orbits and collisions of planetesimals
resulting in large numbers of Moon- to Mars-sized objects. At a radial distance of
1 AU from the central star, this process occurs within a million years (e.g., Kokubo
and Ida (2002)). The gaseous disk is still present at this phase. The late collisions
of these oligarchs over 100 My produces a sparse system of massive planets.
If the Earth formed at around 1 AU in such a disk, it must have formed in a
very dry zone without much water. This is because the snow-line for water – that
radius in the protostellar disk which separates a hot inner region of the disk, where
water cannot condense, from an outer region, where the temperature is low enough
for water to freeze out and condense in grains and planetesimals – occurs at 2.5
AU. The Earth’s ocean probably arose as a consequence of the delivery of water
by bodies that formed beyond 2.5 AU and that later collided with the Earth. It is
now thought that water ice in comets is unlikely to be the source, as the deuterium

to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of comets is twice that found in Earth’s water. Perhaps
only 10% of the Earth’s ocean came from a cometary source. It has been suggested
(Morbidelli et al., 2000) that water arrived from the asteroid belt through the impact
of water-laden planetary embryos, such as those discussed above.
Massive planets, such as Jupiter, play a major role in this process. Numerical
simulations (Raymond et al., 2004) show that the presence of a Jovian mass planet
stirs up planetesimals and perturbs them into ever more eccentric orbits. Such orbits
carry the planetary embryos into the hot, dry inner regions of the disk where they can
undergo collisions with the Earth. This is a stochastic process, and the simulations
show that the majority of Earth-like planets that formed in the ‘habitable zone’
(0.8–1.5 AU) have water contents that are within an order of magnitude of that of
the Earth. The water content has a broad range, however, extending from some dry
worlds to a few watery ones that have more than 100 times more water than there
is on Earth.
In fact, massive gas-giant (Jovian) planets play a dominant role in the formation
and evolution of entire planetary systems. How they form is still is unclear, but
there are two major contemporary models that are under intense investigation. The
more popular of these is the core accretion picture wherein a rocky core that grows
to about 5–10 Earth masses can then rapidly accrete gas from the disk. This may
take a few million years, however – uncomfortably close to the observational limit
for disk lifetimes (Pollack et al., 1996). The alternative picture is that Jovian planets
form as a consequence of rapid gravitational instability in a fairly massive disk (e.g.,
Mayer et al. (2002)). Whatever the mechanism of its formation, the ﬁnal mass of
a giant planet is dependent strongly on the structure of the disk (its pressure scale
height) as well as the magnitude of its turbulent viscosity. Jovian planets cease
to grow when their mass (known as the gap-opening mass) is large enough to
exert a torque on their surrounding disks in the face of turbulent viscosity, thereby
opening a signiﬁcant gap in it. The disappearance of the corresponding ring of
emission from the gas at this radius translates into a notch-like feature in the SED,
which can be searched for in the spectra of forming stars. The advent of the highly
sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in the latter part of this decade
will allow such gaps to be imaged directly, as will the emission from the forming
Jupiter (e.g., Wolf and D’Angelo (2005)).
Planets exert signiﬁcant tidal forces on their natal disks and this results in the
inward migration of the planet (Lin and Papaloizou, 1993). This process is quite
general and explains why the newly discovered extrasolar planets observed around
solar-type stars have orbits well within 5 AU and sometimes at the equivalent radius
of the orbit of Mercury (see Chapter 1). Jupiter mass planets are thought to have
formed at much larger disk radii, where gas is more abundant, and migrated to
their present positions. Models show that planets can migrate very quickly – within

a million years or so – and are liable to be swallowed by the star. This presents
a problem as to why there are any planetary systems in the ﬁrst place. Also, the
migration of massive planets will strongly perturb the smaller terrestrial planets
and this is of profound signiﬁcance for the origin of life in such systems.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for saving planetary systems from such
rapid destruction by their central stars. One of possible universal applicability is
the role of so-called dead zones that occur in disks (Matsumura et al., 2007). Dead
zones are regions that are too poorly ionized to support the kind of hydromagnetic
turbulence in disks that makes them ‘viscous’. Such zones may extend up to 15 AU
or so and are marked by low viscosity. A massive planet that migrates into such a
region will readily open a large gap in the disk. Its radial inward migration is then
locked to the slow rate at which gas in the dead zone drifts inwards.

4.3 Protoplanetary disks and the formation of biomolecules
Well over 100 molecules, many of them organic, have been identiﬁed in interstellar
gas. The clumps and cores in molecular clouds out of which stars form have
densities ranging from 104 cm−3 to 108 cm−3 and low temperatures. In this state,
cold gas chemistry can account for the formation of simple molecules (CO, N2 ,
O2 , C2 H2 , C2 H4 , and HCN). The surfaces of dust grains play host to the formation
of more complex organic molecules, which include nitriles, aldehydes, alcohols,
acids, ethers, ketones, amines, amides, and long-chain hydrocarbons.
For decades, our knowledge of the chemistry in the solar nebula was based
on studies of planetary atmospheres, meteorites, and comets. Current observations
allow us to study directly the chemistry of disks around other stars. This work reveals
that active chemistry occurs near the surface regions of protoplanetary disks. This
chemistry is in disequilibrium and is similar observationally to that found in dense
regions directly exposed to ultraviolet and X-ray irradiation (Bergin et al., 2006).
Chemistry and reaction rates in protoplanetary disks depend on the local gas
density, temperature, and radiation ﬁeld. Disks are not ﬂat but are instead observed
to be ﬂared. Their surfaces, therefore, are exposed to radiation from the central
star. The vertical structure of disks arises from the fact that the pressure gradient
of the gas at any radius and scale height in the disk supports the weight of the
material above it. The force that must be balanced is the vertical component of the
gravitational ﬁeld of the central star (e.g., Dubruelle et al. (2006)).
Self-consistent calculations show that the heating of such ﬂaring disks is due
primarily to the ultraviolet radiation from the central star that is absorbed by dust
grains in such surface layers (Chiang and Goldreich, 1997; D’Alessio et al., 1998).
The dust in the disk envelope then reradiates this energy in the form of infrared and
submillimetre photons – about half of which escape vertically away from the disk,

while the remainder radiate downwards towards the disk midplane. These infrared
photons are then absorbed by the deeper lying dust and ultimately radiate out of
the disk. The gas is heated by collisions with the warm dust and cools by radiating
this energy in the form of molecular vibration–rotation emission lines that can
be observed. This overall process produces a disk that is hottest near the surface
layers and cooler towards the midplane. By balancing all of these heating and
cooling rates, one can determine the local disk temperature distribution and hence
the disk’s SED. The prediction that the temperature should scale as T ∝ r −0.5 is
close to that observed.
The vertical structure of disks at disk radii beyond 100 AU consists of three
layers; the radiation-dominated surface layer or ‘photon-dominated region’ (PDR),
which consists mainly of atomic and ionized species, a molecular layer at greater
depth beyond which most ultraviolet radiation has been absorbed by the grains, and
the cold midplane layer noted above. This midplane region turns out to be so cold
(around 20 K) that most heavy species, such as CO, freeze out on the dust grains.
Figure 4.2 shows a schematic of the disk. It is the molecular layer that is of primary
interest for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.
Observations of molecules so far are still limited by the sensitivity of telescopes
as the emission is so weak. By far, the most abundant molecule is molecular
hydrogen, H2 , but it is generally hard to detect. The most abundant species that
have been observed to date in disks include HCO+ , CN, CS, HCN, H2 CO, and
DCO+ (e.g., Dutrey et al. (1997), van Zadelhoff et al. (2001)). Silicates such as
Mg2 SiO4 (forsterite) have been detected in the hot surface layers of the inner regions
of the disk (r ≤ 1–10 AU). This is important because the shape and strength of
silicate features in disk spectra allow one to track the evolution and growth of
dust grains in disks with time. Ices of H2 O, CO2 , and CO are observed in the outer

regions of the disks, where temperatures drop to less than 100 K. The most abundant
organic molecules observed are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.
Their abundance per H atom is of the order of 10−7 . Up to 50% of carbon may
be locked up in such carbonaceous solids. They are important for disk chemistry
because they absorb ultraviolet radiation and act as potential sites for H2 formation.
Dust grains that are coated with simple icy mantles warm up as they are mixed
and transported to dense, active protostellar regions. This can occur in regions
such as the so-called hot cores that are hosts to massive star formation or the
innermost regions of protoplanetary disks. These regions are particularly rich in
organic molecules. Ultraviolet irradiation, or perhaps X-ray bombardment, then
breaks bonds, and allows reactions that can produce organic molecules. However,
evaporation of these simple dust grain surfaces can drive gas phase production of
organics.
It is now well established that organic molecules of extra terrestrial origin
are found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The best-studied of these is the
Murchison meteorite, in which 8 of the 20 biological amino acids have been found
(Engel and Nagy, 1982). Meteorites also contain many other organic molecules that
are relevant in astrobiology (Sephton, 2002), including lipids that have been shown
to be capable of membrane formation (see Chapter 5). The organic molecules in
meteorites may have originally arisen on dust grains, which were then incorporated
into comets and meteorites. The possibility that dust grains with icy mantles are a
site for amino acid synthesis has been investigated experimentally. Bernstein et al.
(2002) and Munoz-Caro et al. (2002) have shown that amino acids such as glycine,
alanine, and serine may result from the exposure of icy mantles consisting of HCN,
ammonia (NH3 ), and formaldehyde (H2 CO) to ultraviolet radiation.
Alternatively, it has been proposed that amino acids such as glycine and
alanine, and the base adenine can form during the gravitational collapse of a core.
Chakrabarti and Chakrabarti (2000) added reactions that make amino acids (e.g., by
the Strecker process – wherein an aldehyde starting material combines with HCN
in ammonia to form the corresponding aminonitrile, which upon hydrolysis forms
the amino acid) to the existing UMIST database of chemical reactions in molecular
clouds. This created a reaction network involving 421 molecular species. As an
example, they found that the glycine that was formed had a mass fraction of order
10−12 . It peaks at a radius of approximately 100 AU and a time of a million years
after the initiation of the collapse. The astronomical detection of interstellar amino
acids, such as glycine, would strengthen the link between the chemistry of disks
and observed amino acids in meteorites. A spectroscopic survey for amino acids in
clouds and disks will be possible with ALMA.
Organic molecules contained in comets and meteorites are delivered to Earth
when impact events occur, and it is known that impacts were frequent in the

early history of the Solar System. Impacts release huge amounts of energy which
might cause thermal degradation of macromolecules. However, Pierazzo and Chyba
(1999) predicted that molecules such as amino acids can survive such impacts
and that the rate of delivery of biomolecules from space could exceed the rate of
synthesis on Earth.

4.4 Measurements and experiments on amino acid synthesis
The previous section presents the case for synthesis of biomolecules in
protoplanetary disks, but several mechanisms of prebiotic synthesis on Earth have
also been debated for many years. In this section, we show that these results combine
to give a coherent picture of which amino acids were most abundant on the early
Earth. We focus on amino acids because of their fundamental importance in biology
and because they have been detected in a wide range of non-biological contexts
relevant to prebiotic synthesis.
In Table 4.1, each column contains observed amino acid concentrations,
normalized relative to glycine unless otherwise stated. In the following discussion,
column numbers refer to this table. Column M1 is the H2 O extract from the
Murchison meteorite (Engel and Nagy, 1982). Column M2 is the Murray meteorite
(Cronin and Moore, 1971), and column M3 is the interior, hydrolysed sample of
the Yamato meteorite (Shimoyama et al., 1979). Several amino acids that are not
used biologically are found to be as abundant in meteorites as the biological ones
(Kvenvolden et al., 1971). We will not consider non-biological amino acids in
this chapter. However, the question of why certain amino acids came to be used in
proteins and others did not is an important one, and in many cases reasons have been
proposed as to why the non-biological ones were avoided (Weber and Miller, 1981).
Column I1 shows measurements from an experiment simulating the chemistry on
icy grains (Munoz-Caro et al., 2002).
Miller and Urey showed that amino acids could be synthesized by exposure of
a mixture of reducing gases to ultraviolet radiation or electrical discharge. These
experiments were intended to show that synthesis was possible in the atmosphere of
the early Earth, which was presumed to be reducing. Column A1 shows the results
with an atmosphere of CH4 , NH3 , H2 O, and H2 (Miller and Orgel, 1974), and
column A2 shows the results with an atmosphere of CH4 , N2 , H2 O, and traces
of NH3 (Miller and Orgel, 1974). Although yields are lower in non-reducing
atmospheres, column A3 shows an experiment using proton irradiation of an
atmosphere of CO, N2 , and H2 O (Miyakawa et al., 2002), which is not a strongly
reducing mixture.
Another competing theory is that life originated in high-temperature, highpressure environments in the deep sea (Amend and Shock, 1998). Chemical

syntheses of amino acids in hydrothermal conditions have been reported. Column
H1 is from Marshall (1994), and H2 is from Hennet et al. (1992). Each of these
columns gives the number of times that the amino acid was observed in greater
than trace amounts in a large number of experiments. The ﬁnal three columns
are miscellaneous chemical synthesis experiments: S1 is shock synthesis from a
gaseous mixture (Bar-Nun et al., 1970); S2 is synthesis from ammonium cyanide
(Exp. 2 of Lowe et al., 1963); S3 is synthesis from CO, H2 , and NH3 at high
temperature in the presence of catalysts (Yoshino et al., 1971). This column shows
the number of positive identiﬁcations of the amino acid from many experiments.
It is possible that the organic molecules that were present when life began were
synthesized by several different mechanisms. A central issue is to estimate what
fraction originated on Earth and what fraction was brought to Earth after synthesis
in protoplanetary disks (Whittet, 1997). The yields on Earth are dependent on
the mixture of gases in the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is non-reducing, yields
on Earth are low, and delivery of molecules from space is more relevant (Chyba
and Sagan, 1992; Kasting, 1993; Pierazzo and Chyba, 1999). Although there is
now a reasonable consensus that the atmosphere was not strongly reducing, the

4.5 A role for thermodynamics

73

importance of synthesis in the atmosphere is maintained by some (Lazcano and
Miller, 1996; Miyakawa et al., 2002), and this type of synthesis still works to some
degree in intermediate atmospheres. Despite this uncertainty, the results in Table
4.1 are surprisingly consistent as regards which amino acids can be synthesized,
even if they are in disagreement about where and how they were formed.
In his studies of the origin of the genetic code, Trifonov (2000, 2004) collected 60
criteria by which the amino acids can be ranked. A consensus order was obtained by
averaging the rankings. This procedure incorporates diverse criteria that are not all
consistent with one another, and some of these must be misleading. Nevertheless,
the consensus order that emerges appears to be a useful one. We shall call the average
ranks derived from genetic code criteria Rcode . In this section we derive our own
ranking, Robs , based only on observed frequencies of amino acids in non-biological
syntheses, i.e., we use non-speculative criteria.
We ranked the amino acids according to each criterion in Table 4.1 separately.
For example, for criterion M2, G is most frequent and is given rank 1. The next
two, D and E, are equally frequent, and are both given rank 2.5. The next three are
A, V, and P, with ranks 4, 5, and 6. All the remaining amino acids are not observed,
and are given an equal bottom rank 13.5 (the average of the numbers between 7
and 20). Robs is the mean of the ranks obtained from the 12 columns.
Several points are worth noting from Table 4.1. G is the most abundant amino
acid in all but column A2, where it is second. A, D, and E are also abundant in
most experiments. The next six (V, S, I, L, P, T) are all found in the Miller–Urey
experiment (A2), at least one of the meteorites, and several of the other cases.
Therefore, there is good evidence for prebiotic synthesis of all the amino acids
down as far as T on the list. The following four (K, F, R, H) are not found in
the Miller experiments or in meteorites and occur only in one or two of the other
chemical synthesis experiments. The remaining amino acids (N, Q, C, Y, M, W)
are not formed in any of the experiments. In our view, the data are not sufﬁcient to
make a deﬁnite distinction between K, F, R, H and N, Q, C, Y, M, W.
4.5 A role for thermodynamics
Thermodynamic arguments can help us to understand what the mixtures of amino
acids available to early organisms may have been like, and why there is considerable
consensus among the experiments considered in the previous section. Table 4.2
lists the amino acids and their properties according to the ranking Robs derived
above. We will refer to the top ten amino acids as ‘early’ and the bottom ten as
‘late’. Early amino acids were easily synthesized by non-biological means and
were, therefore, available for use by early organisms. Late amino acids were not
available in appreciable quantities until organisms evolved a means to synthesize

them. The early–late distinction is relevant in the discussion of the origin of the
genetic code in the following section. Our ranking, Robs , is close to the ranking,
Rcode , taken from Table V of Trifonov (2004). The top three are the same, and nine
amino acids are in the top ten of both orders. We prefer Robs on the grounds that it is
derived directly from experimental observables; however, the conclusions drawn
from both rankings are very similar.
The ranking can be interpreted on thermodynamic grounds. Amend and Shock
(1998) have calculated the free energy of formation of the amino acids from
CO2 , NH+
4 , and H2 in two sets of conditions. Gsurf in Table 4.2 corresponds
to surface seawater conditions (18 ◦ C, 1 atm), and Ghydro corresponds to deepsea hydrothermal conditions (100 ◦ C, 250 atm). Figure 4.3 shows that Robs is closely
related to Gsurf . For the ten early amino acids, there is a strong correlation between
the two (r = 0.96).
The late amino acids have signiﬁcantly higher Gsurf than the early ones.
The means and standard deviations of the groups are 169.3 ± 42.0 and 285.0 ±
94.1 kJ/mol. Table 4.2 also lists the molecular weight (MW) of each amino acid
and the ATP cost, which is the number of ATP molecules that must be expended
to synthesize the amino acids using the biochemical pathways in E. coli bacteria

linear regression for the early amino acids.

(Akashi and Gojobori, 2002). The means and standard deviations of MW for early
and late groups are 116.2 ± 20.6 and 157.3 ± 23.2 Da, and the ﬁgures for ATP cost
are 18.5 ± 6.9 and 36.2 ± 17.3. Thus it is clear that the late group are larger and
more thermodynamically costly.
We have omitted the two sulphur-containing amino acids, Met and Cys, from
Figure 4.3. Several of the experiments in Table 4.1 do not include sulphur in the
reaction mixture, so these amino acids are bound to be absent from the products.
Thus, the value of Robs for Met and Cys is unclear. Nevertheless, Met and Cys are
absent from the meteorites, and are late according to Rcode , so it seems reasonable to
classify them in the late group. Additionally, there are some uncertainties associated
with Met and Cys in the data used in the calculation of Gsurf by Amend and
Shock (1998): the concentration of Cys in seawater was not reported; Met and Val
were not distinguishable, which makes the concentration of Met uncertain; and
the concentration of H2 S was below detection (this affects Gsurf for Met and
Cys but not the other amino acids). The value of Gsurf = 113.22 kJ mol−1 for
Met is puzzling. This is lower than for any of the other late amino acids, and is
particularly surprising as it is lower than the ﬁgure for Cys (Met is a larger molecule
than Cys). For all these reasons it seemed preferable to omit Met and Cys from
this ﬁgure.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

All the formation reactions are endergonic (Gsurf > 0). The amino acids
with the smallest Gsurf should be formed most easily, as they require the
least free energy input. Figure 4.3 demonstrates this. The values of Gsurf
are predictive of what we see in a wide range of meteorite and prebiotic
synthesis experiments. If the mixture of compounds were in equilibrium, then we
would expect the concentrations to depend exponentially on G via the Boltzmann
factor exp(−G/kT ). The ranking procedure linearizes this relationship and makes
the correlation easier to see. The exponential dependence explains why the amino
acids with high G are not seen in experiment: their concentration would be too
low to detect. Observed concentrations also depend on the rates of formation and
not just on equilibrium thermodynamics. The middle-ranking amino acids show
considerable ﬂuctuation between the columns of Table 4.1, being present in some
cases and not others. This may reﬂect differences in rates of synthesis between
different experimental conditions. The ranking procedure averages out these
ﬂuctuations.
The picture becomes less clear when we consider the free energy of formation
under hydrothermal conditions. The central message of Amend and Shock (1998)
is that many of the formation reactions are exergonic (Ghydro < 0) under
hydrothermal conditions, and that even the endergonic ones are less positive than
they are at the surface. They use this to explain why hydrothermal vents might be a
good place for current life, and to support the idea that the ﬁrst organisms might have
been deep-sea chemosynthesizers. However, there is no correlation between rank
and Ghydro , and no signiﬁcant difference in Ghydro between early and late amino
acids. The two experiments designed to simulate hydrothermal systems (H1 and H2)
give results that agree fairly well with the combined ranking from the other data.
The Ghydro values do not seem to agree with the H1 and H2 experiments any
better than they agree with the overall ranking. Although this does not rule out the
possibility of a hydrothermal origin of life, what does appear clear is that the ten
early amino acids identiﬁed by the ranking procedure can be predicted on the basis
of Gsurf and not Ghydro .
4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code
One of our main motivations for discussing prebiotic amino acid formation above
is that we are interested in the origin of the genetic code and protein synthesis. The
previous section gives us a good idea which were the early amino acids available
at the time the genetic code evolved. However, many other types of biomolecules
would have been around as well as amino acids, and life must already have reached
a rather advanced stage before the genetic code and protein synthesis could have
evolved. In this chapter, we will not attempt to discuss the origin of life itself, but

4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code

77

we will present our reasons for believing that an RNA world stage existed in the
early history of life, that the genetic code arose in the context of an RNA world,
and that the mixture of prebiotic amino acids available inﬂuenced the structure of
this code.
Current life is based on DNA and proteins: proteins carry out the majority of
catalytic roles in the cell, and DNA stores the genetic information. Proteins are
made using the information speciﬁed in the DNA sequence (genome) of the cell.
Proteins do not have their own hereditary mechanism. Double-stranded DNA does
have a hereditary mechanism because each strand can act as a template for synthesis
of the complementary strand. In current organisms, DNA synthesis is catalysed by
protein enzymes. Thus, DNA and proteins are mutually dependent, and it is difﬁcult
to see how one could have existed without the other. The RNA world hypothesis was
proposed as a way out of this chicken-and-egg dilemma. The RNA world is a period
thought to have existed in the early stages of life in which RNA molecules carried
out both catalytic and genetic roles. This is supported by the fact that there are many
viruses in which the genome is RNA (although no longer any cellular organisms),
and by the increasing repertoire of catalytic RNAs that are being synthesized by
in vitro selection techniques (Joyce, 2002).
It is thought that when organisms evolved the ability to synthesize speciﬁc
proteins, these proteins took over most of the catalytic roles formerly performed by
RNA. Also DNA took over the role of information storage from RNA at some stage.
Nevertheless, RNA was retained as an intermediate between DNA and proteins:
information in the DNA gene sequence is ﬁrst transcribed into an RNA sequence
and then translated into a protein sequence. There are also a certain number of types
of RNAs with key biochemical roles that occur widely in all domains of life and
that are thought to be relics of the RNA world (Jeffares et al., 1998). Joyce (2002)
likened this situation to a primitive civilization that existed before recorded history
but which left its mark on the modern civilization that followed.
There are still important gaps in our understanding of the RNA world, and it is
not known if complex self-replicating RNAs could have originated de novo. It may
be that there was no single self-replicating RNA, and that life began with a network
of reactions of many molecular components (Shapiro, 2006). These components
could have been RNAs or other types of biomolecules. Nevertheless, we are
persuaded that life on Earth passed through an RNA world stage, even if something
preceded this. Translation is the process by which the sequence information in an
RNA molecule is used to make a speciﬁc protein. Translation depends on RNA
in several ways. Firstly, the messenger RNA contains the sequence information;
secondly, ribosomal RNA is the active component of the ribosome – the complex of
macromolecules that catalyses formation of proteins (Moore and Steitz, 2002); and
thirdly, the transfer RNAs are the ‘adaptors’that make the link between nucleic acids

and amino acids. Therefore, it is likely that translation originated in organisms in
which RNAs played a central role and in which a mechanism of accurate replication
of relatively long RNA sequences had already evolved.
The key to translation is the genetic code. This is the set of assignments between
the 64 possible codons (three-letter sequences composed of U, C, A, and G
nucleotides) in RNA and the 20 possible amino acids in proteins. The genetic
code is decoded by complementary base pairing between the codon sequence in
the messenger RNA and the anticodon sequence on the transfer RNAs (readers
requiring more information should consult any biology textbook). The canonical
genetic code shown in Table 4.3 is shared by the three domains of life (archaea,
bacteria, and eukaryotes). Therefore, it evolved prior to the last universal common
ancestor (LUCA). Understanding how it arose is a fundamental question in
evolutionary biology.
As prebiotic synthesis of the early group of amino acids seems to be possible in
a number of environments, it is likely that these early amino acids were available
to RNA-based organisms. Prior to the evolution of the genetic code, amino acids
could have played a role in metabolism, and it is possible that polypeptides might
also have been synthesized if peptide bond formation was catalysed by a ribozyme.

4.6 The RNA world and the origin of the genetic code

79

For more details of possible types of chemistry that could have existed in this
period, see Pascal et al. (2005). However, before the genetic code evolved, any
peptides would have had stochastic amino acid compositions. When the genetic
code arose, it became possible to synthesize speciﬁc proteins where the amino acid
sequence was predetermined by the RNA sequence. Speciﬁc proteins can have
speciﬁc structures and hence speciﬁc functions; therefore, they are much more
useful to an organism than are stochastic peptides. The invention of the genetic
code is a stroke of evolutionary brilliance which couples the hereditary mechanism
inherent in the template-directed replication of nucleic acids to the catalytic
possibilities of proteins. Prior to the genetic code, proteins could not undergo
evolution.
Early versions of the code probably used a smaller repertoire of amino acids, each
with a larger number of codons. The codon table was divided up into progressively
smaller blocks as successive amino acids were added. This idea goes as far back
as Crick (1968). Each addition would have opened up a whole new world of
protein possibilities. Thus, there is a selective drive for adding new amino acids
in the early stages of code development. This brings us back to question of the
order of addition of amino acids to the genetic code. We have shown above that
the early group of amino acids can be identiﬁed based on their appearance in
meteorites, the Miller–Urey experiment, and a variety of other chemical syntheses
designed to simulate prebiotic conditions. The strong correlation between the
ranking, Robs , that we derive and the free energy of formation, Gsurf , suggests
that this ranking is a meaningful prediction of the relative frequencies of abiotically
synthesized amino acids that would have been available to the ﬁrst organisms.
Essentially the same amino acids are placed early in Rcode (Trifonov, 2004)
as well.
We therefore envisage an organism in the RNA world that learned to use the
available amino acids to synthesize proteins in a prescribed way and found this
to be extremely useful. Such an organism would have begun to evolve metabolic
pathways to synthesize these amino acids itself from other chemicals so that it
was no longer reliant on the prebiotic supply. As this process proceeded, pathways
developed for synthesis of the more complex, late group of amino acids that were
never present in appreciable quantities prebiotically. At some point along the line,
proteins became so useful and so essential that the RNA-based organisms were
replaced by modern DNA/protein-based organisms. This scenario has long been
advocated by Wong (1975) as part of what is known as the coevolution theory for the
origin of the code. In an updated version of this theory, Wong (2005) proposed the
same set of early and late amino acids as us, based on synthesis from atmospheric
gases. We have shown above that this set of early amino acids seems likely, even
if the place of origin is different.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

4.7 How was the genetic code optimized?
There is considerable evidence that the canonical code has evolved to minimize the
effect of errors (Freeland et al., 2003). Mutations create errors in the gene sequence
that are passed to the protein sequences translated from this gene. Translational
errors due to codon–anticodon mispairing or mischarging of a tRNA will introduce
occasional non-heritable errors into proteins. These errors are likely to involve only
one of the three bases in the codon most of the time. Errors can be minimized by
arranging for codons that differ by only one base to code for the same amino acid or
amino acids with similar physical properties. Thus, when an error leads to an amino
acid replacement, it is usually replaced by a similar amino acid, and the deleterious
effect on the protein is minimized. The canonical code has been compared with
large numbers of random codes created by reshufﬂing the amino acid positions in
the table of codons. The fraction of random codes for which the average effect
of an error is less than in the canonical code is as small as 10−6 (Freeland and
Hurst, 1998), and can be even smaller than this if the effect of unequal amino acid
frequencies is also accounted for (Gilis et al., 2001).
It was originally thought that the canonical code was shared by all organisms
and that it was frozen and unable to change. However, although the majority of
organisms use the canonical code, there are now a large number of cases known
where small changes to the code have occurred in speciﬁc lineages (Knight et al.,
2001). There are several different mechanisms by which codon reassignment can
occur despite the negative selective effects that are present during the changeover
period (Sengupta and Higgs, 2005, Sengupta et al., 2007). The variant codes have
all arisen since the establishment of the canonical code. In this chapter, we are more
concerned with the origin of the canonical code itself.
One remarkable pattern in the code is that the ﬁve highest ranking amino acids,
Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, and Val, all have codons of the form GNN (codons with ﬁrst
position G are on the bottom row of Table 4.3). It is possible that only these GNN
codons were assigned in the ﬁrst code. Trifonov (1987) argued that the ﬁrst position
G is important for maintaining the correct reading frame during translation. Eigen
and Winkler-Oswatitsch (1981) proposed an initial code with only the four GNC
codons assigned (one codon each for Gly, Ala, Asp, and Val). However, such a
system has the disadvantage that a large fraction of codons are unassigned, and that
most mutations in a gene sequence would create untranslatable codons. It would
be advantageous to rapidly progress to a stage where all codons were assigned,
as this reduces the mutational load. A possibility that we consider likely is that
there was a stage in which the code was divided simply into four columns: all
NUN codons were Val, all NCN codons were Ala, all NAN codons were Asp (or a
mixture of Asp and Glu), and all NGN codons were Gly. In this pattern, there is still

a shift of three bases between successive codons, but only the second position base
carries information. This means that the code can become more speciﬁc later by
assigning signiﬁcance to ﬁrst and third positions without destroying the information
contained at the second position (Crick, 1968). Later, preﬁx and sufﬁx codons may
have arisen (Wu et al., 2005), where either the ﬁrst and second or the second and
third bases were signiﬁcant. This would have broken up the four columns into
smaller divisions.
This proposal is consistent with the observation that the code is error-minimizing.
Selection would have acted to ensure each new amino acid was added in a favourable
position. This would mean that amino acids would be added into positions that used
to be occupied by an earlier amino acid with similar properties. Work by H. Goodarzi
(personal communication) also makes this point. In the ﬁrst column Phe, Leu, Ile,
and Met are similar to Val, and in the second column Ser, Pro, and Thr are similar
to Ala. A general property of the code is that amino acids in the same column are
much more similar than those in the same row (Urbina et al., 2006). This may be a
relic of an early four-column stage of the code where all codons in the same column
coded for the same amino acid.
Wong (1975, 2005) also supposes that large blocks of codons were divided up
into smaller ones as new amino acids were added to the code; however, there are
important differences to our argument above. From the pathways of biosynthesis of
amino acids in modern organisms, it is possible to deﬁne precursor–product pairs.
Wong argues that later amino acids were assigned to codons that were formerly
occupied by their biochemical precursors. The earliest code would have contained
only the amino acids that are at the start of the biochemical pathways. Di Giulio
and Medugno (1999) showed the complex pattern of assignments that would have
existed in the early code if every current amino acid were replaced by its earliest
precursor. This pattern seems unlikely to us because it would require a very complex
molecular recognition process for tRNA charging. The initial four-column pattern
that we propose would require straightforward molecular recognition of the second
base in the anticodon. The precursor–product argument predicts that precursor–
product pairs in the canonical code should occupy neighbouring codons. The
statistical signiﬁcance of this depends on the details of how precursor–product
pairs are counted (Ronneberg et al., 2000) and is not as high as was previously
claimed. Our argument is that later amino acids were added to positions that were
formerly occupied by amino acids with similar properties, irrespective of whether
the earlier amino acid was a precursor of the later. This predicts that amino acids
on neighbouring codons should have similar properties, i.e., the code should be
optimized in the sense of Freeland and Hurst (1998). The statistical evidence for
this is much more robust, as discussed above.

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

In contrast to both these theories, it has also been proposed that there were speciﬁc
interactions between amino acids and their codons or anticodons. Evidence for this
comes from selection experiments on random RNA pools (Yarus et al., 2005).
Although this is intriguing, to us it is the error-minimizing properties of the code
that most demand an explanation. An error-minimizing code can be reached by
a pathway in which natural selection acts each time a new amino acid is added.
Precursor–product relationships and RNA–amino acid interactions might inﬂuence
which codons were most likely to be ‘tried out’ for a new amino acid, but selection
would eliminate those trial codes in which an amino acid was added in ‘the wrong
place’, and would favour the addition of a new amino acid in a place that was
consistent with its physical properties. Thus our principle for amino acid addition
explains how the code became optimized.

4.8 Protein evolution
The previous section envisages early proteins composed of a small set of amino
acids. Several studies have considered whether such proteins could be functional.
Using only three amino acids (Gln, Leu, and Arg), proteins with strong helical
structure were found (Davidson et al., 1995). Doi et al. (2005) found that random
sequences of the ﬁve most abundant early amino acids according to our ranking,
Gly, Ala, Asp, Glu, and Val, were more soluble than random sequences of 20 amino
acids or Gln–Leu–Arg proteins. Riddle et al. (1997) took a 57-residue structural
domain of a naturally occurring protein and found that almost all residues could be
replaced by an amino acid from a simple alphabet of Ile–Lys–Glu–Ala–Gly. The
smallest amino acids, Gly and Ala, were essential parts of this alphabet. The large
aromatic amino acids, Trp, Phe, and Tyr, which are late according to our theory,
were not able to be replaced by amino acids from the simple alphabet. Babajide
et al. (1997) used inverse-folding programmes to locate sequences that are likely to
fold to a speciﬁed natural protein structure. Suitable sequences could be found for
some very small alphabets (including Ala–Asp–Leu–Gly, which is very similar to
our proposed original set) but not others (including Gln–Leu–Arg). Taken together,
these studies suggest that proteins composed of the early group of amino acids
could well have formed similar structures to modern day proteins and could have
performed useful functions in early organisms.
Another unusual proposal that is worth mentioning is the proteins-ﬁrst hypothesis
of Ikehara (2005). The same amino acids are again ﬁrst in this theory, but proteins
composed of Gly–Ala–Asp–Val evolve replication and metabolism prior to the
origin of RNA. It is not clear to us how genetic information could be passed on by
proteins alone, however.

4.8 Protein evolution

83

We considered above the role that thermodynamics has in prebiotic synthesis
of amino acids. It also seems likely that thermodynamics effects the evolution of
modern proteins. Akashi and Gojobori (2002) showed that organisms appear to be
sensitive to the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis (listed in Table 4.2). Speciﬁcally,
the most highly expressed proteins had the highest frequency of the low-cost amino
acids. Seligmann (2003) also found considerable evidence that amino acid usage
in proteins is affected by cost minimization. Gutierrez et al. (1996) observed an
increase in frequency of the base G in the ﬁrst codon position in highly expressed
genes, which can be interpreted as selection for low-cost amino acids Gly–Ala–
Asp–Glu–Val.
It is possible that modern day proteins may still contain a signal of which amino
acids were abundant in the early stages of evolution. Phylogenetic methods can
be used to reconstruct estimates of ancestral sequences and hence to determine
the frequencies of amino acids in those sequences. Brooks et al. (2002) estimated
frequencies of amino acids in the LUCA, and found them to be noticeably different
from current proteins. In Table 4.2, p = pLUCA −pcurrent . Jordan et al. (2005) used
a method that involved comparing sequences from triplets of related species. The
earliest diverging species in each triplet can be used to give a direction to the amino
acid substitutions occurring on the branches leading to the other two species. It is
found that forward and backward substitution rates between pairs of amino acids
are not equal, and that amino acids frequencies show an increasing or decreasing
trend. dp/dt is the estimate of the rate of change of the amino acid frequencies.
There are some limited points of agreement between dp/dt and p. The most
rapidly decreasing amino acid is Ala in both cases, and the three most frequent
early amino acids, Gly, Ala, and Asp, are all decreasing. Beyond that, there is little
agreement: only seven amino acids have the same sign in both studies. We would
expect early amino acids to be decreasing and late amino acids to be increasing.
Thirteen amino acids have the right sign according to p, and 14 have the right
sign according to dp/dt. This is suggestive but not fully convincing. McDonald
(2006) has cast doubt on the Jordan et al. (2005) study on methodological grounds,
and a second study of Brooks et al. (2004) produced results that differ from their
previous study (Brooks et al., 2002) as to which amino acids are increasing and
which decreasing. Our position is that trends in amino acid frequencies like this
would have occurred over time and it makes sense to look for them. However, it
is a long time since the LUCA and it may not be possible to see convincing trends
above the noise.
One observation of Brooks et al. (2004) is relevant to the extremophile theme
of this book. They found that the estimated frequencies of amino acids in the
LUCA were closer to those of hyperthermophiles than mesophiles, which might

Protoplanetary disks, amino acids, and the genetic code

suggest that LUCA was a hyperthermophile. It has also been argued that the genetic
code was established at high temperature (Di Giulio, 2000) and high pressure
(Di Giulio, 2005) based on comparison of amino acid frequencies in extremophiles
and mesophiles. The hyperthermophile nature of LUCA is still controversial, and
some cold water is poured on this idea in Chapter 8.

4.9 Summary
In this chapter, we have done our best to combine information from astrophysics,
organic chemistry, molecular evolution, and bioinformatics. It became apparent to
us that the strands of knowledge that link these diverse disciplines are becoming
ever stronger and, indeed, are required to understand how life may have arisen
in our Solar System and perhaps in others. The generality of planet formation
and the universality of the organic chemistry (that is just starting to be explored)
in protoplanetary disks is very encouraging. It suggests that the astrophysics of
protoplanetary disks could play a major role in understanding how one goes from
dust and gas to watery worlds equipped with the biomolecules that may have served
as the ﬁrst building blocks of life. Beyond this, we have also shown that the
abundance and distribution of early amino acids may have played an important
role in the origin of the earliest genetic code and how it may have subsequently
evolved.

Emergent phenomena in biology: the origin
of cellular life

5.1 Introduction
The main themes of this chapter concern the phenomenon of emergence, the origin
of life as a primary example of emergence, and how evolution begins with the
inception of cellular life. The physical properties of certain molecular species
are relevant to life’s origins, because these properties lead to the emergence of
more complex structures by self-assembly. One such property is the capacity of
amphiphilic molecules such as soap to form membranous boundary structures,
familiar examples being soap bubbles and cell membranes. A second example is
the chemical bonding that allows biopolymers such as nucleic acids and proteins to
assemble into functional sequences. Self-assembly processes can produce complex
supramolecular structures with certain properties of the living state. Such structures
are able to capture energy available in the environment and initiate primitive
reactions associated with metabolism, growth, and replication. At some point
approximately 4 billion years ago, cellular compartments appeared that contained
macromolecular systems capable of catalysed growth and replication. Because each
cellular structure would be slightly different from all others, Darwinian evolution by
natural selection could begin, with the primary selective factor being competition
for energy and nutrients.
5.2 Deﬁning emergence
Researchers increasingly use the term emergence to describe processes by which
more complex systems arise from seemingly simpler systems, typically in an
unpredictable fashion. This usage is just the opposite of reductionism, the belief
that any phenomenon can be explained by understanding the parts of that system.
Although reductionism has been a powerful tool in the sciences, the concept of
emergence is also useful in referring to some of the most remarkable phenomena
that we observe in nature and in the laboratory.

Emergent phenomena in biology: the origin of cellular life

One example is the way that orderly arrangements of molecules appear when
a relatively simple system of molecules undergoes a transition to a much more
complex system. For instance, if we add soap molecules to water, at ﬁrst there
is nothing present except the expected clear solution of individual molecules
dissolved in the water. At a certain concentration, additional molecules no longer
dissolve, but instead begin to associate into small aggregates called micelles. As the
concentration increases further, the micelles begin to grow into membranous layers
that cause the originally clear solution to become turbid. Finally, if air is blown
through a straw into the solution, much larger structures appear at the surface, the
soap bubbles that are familiar to everyone.
Such emergent phenomena are called self-assembly processes, or sometimes
self-organization. Typically the process is spontaneous, but in other instances an
input of energy is required to drive self-assembly. One of the deﬁning characteristics
of an emergent property is the element of unpredictability. If we did not know by
observation that soap molecules have properties of self-assembly, we could not have
predicted that micelles would be produced simply by increasing the concentration
of soap molecules in solution. Even knowing that micelles form, there is no physical
theory available that can predict exactly what concentration of soap is required to
form the micelles. And if soap bubbles were not such a common phenomenon,
we would be astonished by their appearance when a soap solution is disturbed by
addition of free energy in the form of an air stream.

5.3 Emergence of life: a very brief history
The origin of life was strongly dependent on physical conditions of the early Earth
environment. Imagine that we could somehow travel back in time to the prebiotic
Earth 3.9 billion years ago. The ﬁrst thing we would notice is that it is very hot, with
temperatures near the boiling point of water. Impacting objects the size of comets
and asteroids add water, carbon dioxide, silicate minerals, and small amounts of
organic material to the planetary surface. They also produce craters on the Moon
that remain as a permanent record of the bombardment. The atmosphere has no
oxygen, but instead is a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Land masses are
present, but they are volcanic islands resembling Hawaii or Iceland, rather than
continents. We are standing on one such island, on a beach composed of black lava
rocks, with tide pools containing clear seawater. We can examine the seawater in
the tide pools with a powerful microscope, but there is nothing to be seen, only a
dilute solution of organic compounds and salts. If we could examine the mineral
surfaces of the lava rocks, we would see that some of the organic compounds have
formed a ﬁlm adhering to the surface, while others assembled into aggregates that
disperse in the seawater.

5.4 The ﬁrst emergent phenomena: self-assembly processes on the early Earth

91

Now imagine that we return 300 million years later. Not much has changed.
The primary land masses are still volcanic in origin, although small continents are
beginning to appear as well. The meteorite impacts have dwindled, and the global
temperature has cooled to around 70 ◦ C. We are surprised when we examine the tide
pools, in which a turbidity has appeared that was not apparent earlier, and the mineral
surfaces are coated with layers of pigmented ﬁlms. When we examine the water and
ﬁlms with our microscope, we discover immense numbers of bacteria present in
the layers. Life has begun.
What happened in the intervening time that led to the origin of life? This is a
fundamental question of biology, and the answer will change the way we think about
ourselves, and our place in the universe, because if life could begin on the Earth,
it could begin by similar processes on Earth-like planets circling other stars in our
galaxy. The origin of life is the most extraordinary example of emergent phenomena,
and the process by which life began must involve the same kinds of intermolecular
forces and self-assembly processes that cause soap to form membranous vesicles
and allow monomers like amino acids and nucleotides to form functional polymers.
The origin of life must also have incorporated the reactions and products that are
the result of energy ﬂowing through a molecular system, thereby driving it toward
ever more complex systems with emergent properties.

5.4 The ﬁrst emergent phenomena: self-assembly processes
on the early Earth
All cellular life today incorporates two processes we will refer to here as selfassembly and directed assembly. The latter process always involves the formation
of covalent bonds by energy-dependent synthetic reactions, and requires that a
coded sequence in one type of polymer in some way directs the sequence of
monomer addition in a second polymeric species. The ﬁrst process – spontaneous
self-assembly – occurs when certain compounds interact through non-covalent
hydrogen bonds, electrostatic forces, and non-polar interactions to form closed
membrane-bounded microenvironments. The self-assembly of membranes is by
far the simplest of the processes associated with the origin of cellular life. It occurs
whenever lipid-like molecules are present in an aqueous environment, and does not
require the covalent bond formation needed for the synthesis of polymers such as
proteins and nucleic acids. For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that membrane
formation preceded the appearance of catalytic and replicating polymers. Boundary
structures and the compartments they produce make energy available in the form
of ion gradients, and can also mediate a selective inward transport of nutrients.
Furthermore, membranous compartments are, in principle, capable of containing
unique systems of macromolecules. If a replicating system of polymers could be

encapsulated within a membrane-bounded compartment, the components of the
system would share the same microenvironment, and the result would be a major
step toward cellularity, speciation, and true cellular function (Deamer and Oro,
1980; Morowitz et al., (1986); Morowitz, 1992; Dyson, (1995)).
We know very little about how this event might have occurred at the origin
of cellular life, but recent advances have provided clues about possible sources of
self-assembling molecules and processes by which large molecules can be captured
in membrane-bounded microenvironments. Here we will describe the chemical
and physical properties of such systems, and several experimental models that
incorporate certain properties related to the origin of cellular life.

5.5 Sources of amphiphilic molecules
The most striking examples of self-assembling molecules are called amphiphiles,
because they have both a hydrophilic (‘water loving’) group and a hydrophobic
(‘water hating’) group on the same molecule. Amphiphilic molecules are among
the simplest of life’s molecular components, and are readily synthesized by nonbiological processes. Virtually any hydrocarbon having ten or more carbons in its
chain takes on amphiphilic properties if one end of the molecule incorporates a polar
or ionic group. The simplest common amphiphiles are therefore molecules such as
soaps, more technically referred to as monocarboxylic acids. A good example is
decanoic acid, which is shown below with its ten carbon chain:

CH3 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –CH2 –COOH
McCollom et al. (1999) and Rushdi and Simoneit (2001) demonstrated that a
series of alkanoic acids and alcohols in this size range can be produced from very
simple organic compounds by Fischer–Tropsch reactions that simulate geothermal
conditions on the early Earth. It has been found that such molecules readily form
membranous vesicles, as shown in Figure 5.1 (Apel et al., 2002). This fact will
become important later when we discuss the emergence of cellular life.
Two possible sources of organic compounds on a primitive planetary surface
are delivery during late accretion, followed by chemical evolution, and synthesis
by geochemical processes in the early atmosphere or hydrosphere. Early
investigations focused on chemical synthesis of monomers common to the primary
macromolecules involved in living systems, with the goal of determining whether it
was possible that biologically relevant compounds were available on the primitive
Earth. Most of these studies emphasized water-soluble compounds such as amino
acids, nucleobases, and simple carbohydrates. The classic experiments of Miller
(1953) and Miller and Urey (1959) showed that amino acids such as glycine

and alanine could be obtained when a mixture of reduced gases was exposed
to an electrical discharge. The mixture was assumed to be a simulation of the
original terrestrial atmosphere which, by analogy with the outer planets, would
have contained hydrogen, methane, ammonia, and water vapour. At sufﬁciently
high energy ﬂuxes, such mixtures of reducing gases generate hydrogen cyanide
and formaldehyde, which in turn react to produce amino acids, purines, and a
variety of simple sugars.
The possibility that organic compounds could be synthesized under prebiotic
conditions was given additional weight when it was convincingly shown that
carbonaceous meteorites contained amino acids, hydrocarbons, and even traces
of purines (Kvenholden et al., 1970; Lawless and Yuen, 1979; Cronin et al.,
1988). Such meteorites are produced by collisions in the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids range up to hundreds of kilometres in diameter, and
are examples of planetesimals that happened to avoid accretion into the terrestrial
planets. Asteroids and their meteoritic fragments therefore represent samples of the
primitive Solar System in which the products of prebiotic chemical reactions have
been preserved for over 4.5 billion years. It was reasonable to assume that similar
reactions and products were likely to have occurred on the Earth’s surface.
In the late 1970s it became increasingly clear that the archaean atmosphere
was largely of volcanic origin and composed of carbon dioxide and nitrogen

Emergent phenomena in biology: the origin of cellular life

rather than the mixture of reducing gases assumed by the Miller–Urey model
(Holland, 1984; Kasting and Broun, 1998). This is consistent with the fact that
approximately 65 atmosphere equivalents of carbon dioxide are present in the
Earth’s crust as carbonate minerals, all of which must have passed through the
atmosphere at some point as a gaseous component. Carbon dioxide does not support
synthetic pathways leading to chemical monomers, so interest was drawn to the
second potential source of organic material, extraterrestrial infall in the form of
micrometeorites and comets. This was ﬁrst proposed by Oró (1961) and Delsemme
(1984) and more recently extended by Anders (1989) and Chyba and Sagan
(1992). The total organic carbon added by extraterrestrial infall over ∼108 years
of late accretion can be estimated to be in the rage of 1016 –1018 kg, which
is several orders of magnitude greater than the 12.5 × 1014 kg total organic
carbon in the biosphere (www.regensw.co.uk/technology/biomass-faq.asp). From
such calculations it seems reasonable that extraterrestrial infall was a signiﬁcant
source of organic carbon in the prebiotic environment. Even today meteorites and
interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) deliver organic materials to the modern Earth
at a rate of ∼106 kg/y−1 (Love and Brownlee, 1992; Maurette, 1998).
The discovery of biologically relevant compounds in meteorites also indicated
that organic synthesis can occur in the interstellar medium, which immediately
leads to the question of sources and synthetic pathways. The most important
biogenic elements (C, N, O, S, and P) form in the interiors of stars, then are
ejected into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) at the end of the star’s
lifetime during red giant, nova, and supernova phases. Following ejection, much
of this material becomes concentrated into dense molecular clouds from which
new stars and planetary systems are formed (Ehrenfreund and Charnley, 2000;
Sandford, 1996). At the low temperatures in these dark molecular clouds, mixtures
of molecules condense to form ice mantles on the surfaces of dust grains where they
can participate in additional chemical reactions. Comparison of infrared spectra
of low-temperature laboratory ices with absorption spectra of molecular clouds
indicates that interstellar ices are mainly composed of H2 O mixed with CO, CO2 ,
CH3 OH, NH3 , and other components, the last ingredients generally comprising
5–15% of the total. The ices are exposed to ionizing radiation in the form of
cosmic rays (and secondary radiation generated by their interaction with matter),
and ultraviolet photons from stars forming within the cloud.
Laboratory experiments have shown that illuminating such ices with ultraviolet
light leads to more complex molecular species (Greenberg and Mendoza-Gomez,
1993; Bernstein et al., 1995; Gerakines et al., 2000; Ehrenfreund et al., 1995).
Hundreds of new compounds are synthesized, even though the starting ices contain
only a few simple common interstellar molecules. Many of the compounds formed
in these experiments are also present in meteorites, comets, and 10 Ps, and some

are relevant to the origin of life, including amino acids (Munoz-Caro et al.,
2002; Bernstein et al., 2002; Bernstein et al., 2001), and amphiphilic material
(Dworkin et al., 2001).
Although it is now clear that organic molecules are synthesized in dense
molecular clouds, the molecules must be delivered to habitable planetary surfaces if
they are to take part in the origin of life. This requires that they survive the transition
from the dense cloud into a protostellar nebula and subsequent incorporation
into planetesimals, followed by delivery to a planetary surface. During the late
bombardment period, which lasted until about 4 billion years ago, the amount of
extraterrestrial organic material brought to the prebiotic Earth was likely to have
been several orders of magnitude greater than current rates of infall (Chyba and
Sagan, 1992). Thus, the early Earth must have been seeded with organic matter
created in the interstellar medium, protosolar nebula, and asteroidal/cometary
parent bodies.

5.6 The emergence of primitive cells
Life on the Earth most likely arose from vast numbers of natural experiments in
which various combinations of organic molecules were mixed and recombined
to form complex interacting systems, then exposed to sources of energy such as
light, heat, and oxidation–reduction potentials presented by donors and acceptors
of electrons. This mixing and recombination probably did not occur in free solution,
but rather in ﬂuctuating environments at aqueous–mineral interfaces exposed to the
atmosphere under conditions that would tend to concentrate the organic material so
that reactions could occur. Through this process, incremental chemical evolution
took place over a period of several hundred million years after the Earth had cooled
sufﬁciently for water vapour to condense into oceans. At some point, membranebounded systems of molecules appeared that could grow and reproduce by using
energy and nutrients from the environment. An observer seeing this endproduct
would conclude that such systems were alive, but would be unable to pinpoint the
exact time when the complex structures took on the property of life.
Here we will assume that the structures described above would be recognizable
cells, and that cellular compartments were required for life to begin. This assumption
differs from the conjectures of Kauffman (1993) and Wächtershäuser (1988) that
life began as a series of reactions resembling metabolism. In their view, autocatalytic
pathways were ﬁrst established, perhaps on mineral surfaces. Over time the systems
became increasingly complex to the point that self-reproducing polymers were
synthesized, with cellular compartments appearing at a later stage. There is as yet
little experimental evidence that allows a choice between the two perspectives of
‘compartments ﬁrst’ or ‘metabolism ﬁrst’. However, because membrane structures

Emergent phenomena in biology: the origin of cellular life

readily self-assemble from amphiphilic compounds known to be present in mixtures
of organic compounds available on the prebiotic Earth, it is highly likely that
membranous compartments were among the ﬁrst biologically relevant structures
to appear prior to the origin of life.
Evidence from phylogenetic analysis suggests that microorganisms resembling
today’s bacteria were the ﬁrst form of cellular life. Traces of their existence can
be found in the fossil record in Australian rocks at least 3.5 billion years old. Over
the intervening years between life’s beginnings and now, evolution has produced
bacteria which are more advanced than the ﬁrst cellular life. The machinery of life
has become so advanced that when researchers began subtracting genes in one of the
simplest known bacterial species, they reached a limit of approximately 265–350
genes that appears to be the absolute requirement for contemporary bacterial
cells (Hutchinson et al., 1999). Yet life did not spring into existence with a full
complement of 300+ genes, ribosomes, membrane transport systems, metabolism,
and the DNA → RNA → protein information transfer that dominates all life today.
There must have been something simpler, a kind of scaffold life that was left behind
in the evolutionary rubble.
Can we reproduce that scaffold? One possible approach was suggested by the
RNA World concept that arose from the discovery of ribozymes, which are RNA
structures having enzyme-like catalytic activities. The idea was greatly strengthened
when it was discovered that the catalytic core of ribosomes is not composed
of protein at the active site, but instead is composed of RNA machinery. This
remarkable ﬁnding offers convincing evidence that RNA likely came ﬁrst, and then
was overlaid by more complex and efﬁcient protein machinery (Hoang et al., 2004).
Another approach to discovering a scaffold is to incorporate one or a few genes
into microscopic artiﬁcial vesicles to produce molecular systems that display certain
features associated with life. The properties of such systems may then provide clues
to the process by which life began in a natural setting of the early Earth. What would
such a system do? We can answer this question by listing the steps that would be
required for a microorganism to emerge as the ﬁrst cellular life on the early Earth:
• Boundary membranes self-assemble from amphiphilic molecules.
• Energy is captured either from light and a pigment system, or from chemical energy, or

both.
• Ion concentration gradients are produced and maintained across the membrane by an

energy-dependent process. The gradient is a source of energy to drive metabolism and
synthetic reactions.
• The energy is coupled to the synthesis of activated monomers, which in turn are used to
make polymers.
• Macromolecules are encapsulated, yet smaller nutrient molecules can cross the membrane
barrier.

• The macromolecules grow by polymerizing the nutrient molecules, using the energy of

metabolism.
• Macromolecular catalysts speed the metabolic reactions and growth processes.
• The macromolecular catalysts themselves are reproduced during growth.
• Information is contained in the sequence of monomers in one set of polymers, and this

set is duplicated during growth. The information is used to direct the growth of catalytic
polymers.
• The membrane-bounded system of macromolecules can divide into smaller structures.
• Genetic information is passed between generations by duplicating the sequences and
sharing them between daughter cells.
• Occasional errors (mutations) are made during replication or transmission of information
so that a population of primitive living organisms can evolve through selection.

Looking down this list, one is struck by the complexity of even the simplest form
of life. This is why it has been so difﬁcult to ‘deﬁne’ life in the usual sense of a
deﬁnition, i.e., boiled down to a few sentences in a dictionary. Life is a complex
system that cannot be captured in a few sentences, so perhaps a list of its observed
properties is the best we can ever hope to do. Given the list, one is also struck by the
fact that all but one of the functions – self-reproducing polymers – have now been
reconstituted individually in the laboratory. For instance, it was shown 40 years ago
that lipid vesicles self-assemble into bilayer membranes that maintain ion gradients
(Bangham et al., 1965). If bacteriorhodopsin is in the bilayer, light energy can be
captured in the form of a proton gradient (Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1973). If
an ATP synthase is in the membrane, the photosynthetic system can make ATP
by coupling the proton gradient to form a pyrophosphate bond between ADP and
phosphate (Racker and Stoeckenius, 1974). Macromolecules such as proteins and
nucleic acids can be easily encapsulated and can function in the vesicles as catalysts
(Chakrabarti and Deamer, 1994) and as membrane transport agents. The system
can grow by addition of lipids, and can even be made to divide by imposing shear
forces, after which the vesicles grow again (Hanczyc et al., 2003). Macromolecules
like RNA can grow by polymerization in the vesicle, driven by catalytic proteins
(Monnard and Deamer, 2006). And ﬁnally, samples of cytoplasm from a living cell
like E. coli are easily captured, including ribosomes. A micrograph of such vesicles
is shown in Figure 5.2.
The ability to capture structures as large as ribosomes has led to attempts to
demonstrate translation in closed vesicles. This was ﬁrst achieved by Yu et al.
(2001) and later by Nomura et al. (2003), who captured samples of bacterial
cytoplasm from E. coli in large liposomes. The samples included ribosomes, tRNAs
and the hundred or so other components required for protein synthesis. The mRNA
containing the gene for green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) was also included in the mix,
which permitted facile detection of protein synthesis. The encapsulated translation

systems worked, but only a few molecules of GFP were synthesized in each vesicle,
because the only amino acids available were those captured within the vesicle. This
limitation was resolved by Noireaux and Libchaber (2004), who included not only
the mRNA for GFP in the mix, but also a second mRNA coding for the pore-forming
protein alpha hemolysin. The hemolysin produced a channel in the lipid bilayer that
allowed externally added ‘nutrients’ in the form of amino acids and ATP to cross the
membrane barrier and supply the translation process with energy and monomers
(Figure 5.3). The system worked well, and GFP synthesis continued for as long as
four days.
These advances permit us to consider whether it might be possible to fabricate a
kind of artiﬁcial life which is reconstituted from a complete system of components
isolated from microorganisms. The system would by deﬁnition overcome the
one limitation described above, the lack of a self-reproducing set of polymers,
because everything in the system would grow and reproduce, including the
catalytic macromolecules themselves and the lipid components of the boundary
membrane. However, such a system requires that the genes for the translation
system (ribosomes, tRNA, and so on) for DNA replication and transcription, and
for lipid synthesis must all be present in a strand of synthetic DNA. When one adds
up the number of essential genes, the total is over a hundred. This might at ﬁrst
seem like a daunting task, but in fact it is within the realm of possibility, in that the
complete set of genes required to synthesize the polio virus has been assembled in
a strand of synthetic DNA (Cello et al., 2002).

Fig. 5.3. Translation in a microenvironment. In the upper ﬁgure, amino acids and
ATP encapsulated in the vesicle volume are used to make small amounts of GFP and
alpha hemolysin (a-HL). The membrane prevents access to external amino acids
and ATP, so the system will quickly exhaust the ‘nutrients’ trapped in the vesicle.
However, because the a-HL is a pore forming protein, it migrates to the membrane
and assembles into a heptamer with a pore large enough to allow amino acids
and ATP to pass into the vesicle (lower ﬁgure). The system can now synthesize
signiﬁcant amounts of new protein, and the vesicle begins to show ﬂuorescence
from the accumulation of GFP (Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004).

This thought experiment clearly points out the limitations of our current
understanding of the origin of cellular life. It does make clear that life could not
begin as a complex molecular system of a hundred or more genes required to
fabricate the simplest possible artiﬁcial cell that uses DNA, RNA, and ribosomes
for self-reproduction. Instead, as noted earlier, there must have been a kind of
molecular scaffold that was much simpler, yet had the capacity to evolve into the
living systems we observe today. Is there any hope that we might discover such a
system? One possible lead is to ﬁnd a ribozyme that can grow by polymerization,
in which the ribozyme copies a sequence of bases in its own structure (Johnston
et al., 2001). So far, the polymerization has only copied a string of 14 nucleotides,
but this is a good start. If a ribozyme system can be found that catalyses its own
complete synthesis using genetic information encoded in its structure, it could
rightly be claimed to have the essential properties that are lacking so far in artiﬁcial
cell models: reproduction of the catalyst itself. Instead of the hundred or so genes
necessary for the translation system described above, the number is reduced to just a
few genes that allow the ribozyme to control its own replication, synthesize catalysts

related to primitive metabolism, including synthesis of membrane components,
and perhaps a pore-forming molecule that allows nutrient transport. Given such
a ribozyme, it is not difﬁcult to imagine its incorporation into a system of lipid
vesicles that would have the basic properties of the living state.

5.7 Self-assembly processes in prebiotic organic mixtures

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

We can now return to considering process that are likely to have occurred on the
prebiotic Earth, ultimately leading to the beginning of life and initiating Darwinian
evolution. We will ﬁrst ask what physical properties are required if a molecule is
to become incorporated into a stable cellular compartment. As discussed earlier,
all membrane-forming molecules are amphiphiles, with a hydrophilic ‘head’ and a
hydrophobic ‘tail’ on the same molecule. If amphiphilic molecules were present in
the mixture of organic compounds available on the early Earth, it is not difﬁcult to
imagine that their self-assembly into molecular aggregates was a common process.
Is this a plausible premise? In order to approach this question, we can assume
that the mixture of organic compounds in carbonaceous meteorites such as the
Murchison meteorite resembles components available on the early Earth through
extraterrestrial infall. A series of organic acids represents the most abundant watersoluble fraction in carbonaceous meteorites (Cronin et al., 1988). Samples of the
Murchison meteorite have been extracted in an organic solvent commonly used to
extract membrane lipids from biological sources (Deamer and Pashley, 1989). When
this material was allowed to interact with aqueous phases, one class of compounds
with acidic properties was clearly capable of forming membrane-bounded vesicles
(Figure 5.4).

Fig. 5.5. Membranous compartments composed of very simple amphiphiles are
capable of encapsulating macromolecules in stable vesicles. In the image above,
DNA molecules have been trapped in decanoic acid vesicles. The DNA is stained
with acridine orange so that it can be visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy. Bar
shows 20 µm.

From these results, it is reasonable to conclude that a variety of simpler
amphiphilic molecules were present on the early Earth that could participate in
the formation of primitive membrane structures. Even if membranous vesicles
were commonplace on the early Earth and had sufﬁcient permeability to permit
nutrient transport to occur, these structures would be virtually impermeable to larger
polymeric molecules that were necessarily incorporated into molecular systems
on the pathway to cellular life. The encapsulation of macromolecules in lipid
vesicles has been demonstrated by hydration–dehydration cycles that simulate
an evaporating lagoon (Shew and Deamer, 1985). Molecules as large as DNA
can be captured by such processes. For instance, when a dispersion of DNA and
fatty acid vesicles is dried, the vesicles fuse to form a multilamellar sandwich
structure with DNA trapped between the layers. Upon rehydration, vesicles reform
that contain highly concentrated DNA, a process that can be visualized by staining
with a ﬂuorescent dye (Figure 5.5).

5.8 Emergence of membrane functions
Membranes have many functions in addition to acting as a container for the
macromolecular polymers of life. Three primary membrane functions associated
with a protocell would include selective inward transport of nutrients from the

environment, capture of the energy available in light or oxidation–reduction
potentials, and coupling of that energy to some form of energy currency such as
ATP in order to drive polymer synthesis.
The simplest of these functions is that of a permeability barrier which limits free
diffusion of solutes between the cytoplasm and external environment. Although
such barriers are essential for cellular life to exist, there must also be a mechanism
by which selective permeation allows speciﬁc solutes to cross the membrane. In
contemporary cells, such processes are carried out by transmembrane proteins that
act as channels and transporters. Examples include the proteins that facilitate the
transport of glucose and amino acids into the cell, channels that allow potassium and
sodium ions to permeate the membrane, and active transport of ions by enzymes
that use ATP as an energy source. It seems unlikely that the ﬁrst living cellular
systems evolved such highly specialized membrane transport systems, which
brings up the question of how early cells overcame the membrane permeability
barrier. One possibility is that simple diffusion across the bilayer may have been
sufﬁcient. To give a perspective on permeability and transport rates by diffusion,
we can compare the ﬂuxes of relatively permeable and relatively impermeable
solutes across contemporary lipid bilayers. The measured permeability of lipid
bilayers to small, uncharged molecules such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide
is greater than the permeability to ions by a factor of ∼109 . Such values mean
little by themselves, but make more sense when put in the context of time
required for exchange across a bilayer: half the water in a liposome exchanges
in milliseconds, while potassium ions have half-times of exchange measured
in days.
We can now consider some typical nutrient solutes like amino acids and
phosphates. Such molecules are ionized, which means that they would not
readily cross the permeability barrier of a lipid bilayer. Permeability coefﬁcients
of liposome membranes to phosphate, amino acids, and nucleotides have been
determined (Chakrabarti and Deamer, 1994; Monnard et al., 2002) and were found
to be similar to ionic solutes such as sodium and chloride ions. From these ﬁgures
one can estimate that if a primitive microorganism depended on passive transport
of phosphate across a lipid bilayer composed of a typical phospholipid, it would
require several years to accumulate phosphate sufﬁcient to double its DNA content,
or pass through one cell cycle. In contrast, a modern bacterial cell can reproduce
in as short a time as 20 minutes.
If solutes like amino acids and phosphate are so impermeant, how could primitive
cells have had access to these essential nutrients? One clue may be that modern
lipids are highly evolved products of several billion years of evolution, and typically
contain hydrocarbon chains 16–18 carbons in length. These chains provide an
interior ‘oily’ portion of the lipid bilayer that represents a nearly impermeable

5.9 Emergence of growth processes in primitive cells

barrier to the free diffusion of ions such as sodium and potassium. The reason
is related to the common observation that ‘oil and water don’t mix’. Using
more technical language, ion permeation of the hydrophobic portion of a lipid
bilayer faces a very high energy barrier which is associated with the difference
in energy for an ion in water to ‘dissolve’ in the oily interior of a lipid bilayer
composed of hydrocarbon chains. However, studies have shown that permeability
is strongly dependent on chain length (Paula et al., 1996). For instance, shortening
phospholipid chains from 18 to 14 carbons increases permeability to ions by nearly
three orders of magnitude. The reason is that thinner membranes have increasing
numbers of transient defects that open and close on nanosecond timescales, so
that ionic solutes can pass from one side of the membrane to the other without
dissolving in the oily interior phase of the bilayer. Ionic solutes even as large as
ATP can diffuse across a bilayer composed of a 14-carbon phospholipid (Monnard
and Deamer, 2001). On the early Earth, shorter hydrocarbon chains would have
been much more common than longer chain amphiphiles, suggesting that the
ﬁrst cell membranes were sufﬁciently leaky so that ionic and polar nutrients
could enter, while still maintaining larger polymeric molecules in the encapsulated
volume.
There are several implications of this conjecture. First, if a living cell is to take
up nutrients by diffusion rather than active transport, the nutrients must be at a
reasonably high concentration, perhaps in the millimolar range. It is doubtful that
such high concentrations would be available in the bulk phase medium of a lake
or sea, which suggests that early life needed to be in an environment such as a
small pond undergoing periodic wet–dry cycles that would concentrate possible
nutrients. On the other hand, that same cell also was likely to have metabolic waste
products, so it could not be in a closed system or it would soon reach thermodynamic
equilibrium in which the waste product accumulation inhibits forward reactions
required for metabolism and synthesis. And ﬁnally, a leaky membrane may allow
entry of nutrients, but it would also be useless for developing the ion gradients that
are essential energy sources for all modern cells. All of these considerations should
guide our thinking as we attempt to deduce conditions that would be conducive for
the origin of cellular life.
5.9 Emergence of growth processes in primitive cells
Reports (Walde et al., 1994) showed that vesicles composed of oleic acid can
grow and ‘reproduce’ as oleoyl anhydride spontaneously hydrolyzed in the reaction
mixture, thereby adding additional amphiphilic components (oleic acid) to the
vesicle membranes. This approach has been extended by Hanczyc et al. (2003), who
prepared myristoleic acid membranes under deﬁned conditions of pH, temperature,

and ionic strength. The process by which the vesicles formed from micellar solutions
required several hours, apparently with a rate limiting step related to the assembly
of ‘nuclei’ of bilayer structures. However, if a mineral surface in the form of clay
particles was present, the surface in some way catalysed vesicle formation, reducing
the time required from hours to a few minutes. The clay particles were spontaneously
encapsulated in the vesicles. The authors further found that RNA bound to the clay
was encapsulated as well. In a second series of experiments, Hanczyc and coworkers
(Hanczyc et al., 2003; Hanczyc and Szostak, 2004) showed that the myristoleic
acid vesicles could be induced to grow by addition of fatty acid to the medium,
presumably by incorporating fatty acid molecules into the membrane, rather than
by fusion of vesicles. If the resulting suspension of large vesicles was then ﬁltered
through a polycarbonate ﬁlter having pores 0.2 µm in diameter, the larger vesicles
underwent a kind of shear-induced division to produce smaller vesicles which could
undergo further growth cycles (Figure 5.6). This remarkable series of experiments
clearly demonstrated the relative simplicity by which complex system of lipid,
genetic material and mineral catalysts can produce a model protocellular structure
that can undergo a form of growth and division.

5.10 Environmental constraints on the ﬁrst forms of life

5.10 Environmental constraints on the ﬁrst forms of life
Although self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules promotes the formation
of complex molecular systems, the physical and chemical properties of an
aqueous phase can signiﬁcantly inhibit such processes, possibly constraining the
environments in which cellular life ﬁrst appeared. One such constraint is that
temperature strongly inﬂuences the stability of vesicle membranes. It has been
proposed that the last common ancestor, and even the ﬁrst forms of life, were
hyperthermophiles that developed in geothermal regions such as hydrothermal
vents (Baross et al., 1983) or deep subterranean hot aquifers (Pace, 1991). Such
environments have the advantage of providing chemical energy in the form of
redox potentials as well as abundant mineral surfaces to act as potential catalysts
and adsorbants. However, because the intermolecular forces that stabilize selfassembled molecular systems are relatively weak, it is difﬁcult to imagine how
lipid bilayer membranes assembling from plausible prebiotic constituents would be
stable under these conditions. All hyperthermophiles today have highly specialized
lipid components, and it seems likely that these are the result of more recent
adaptation than a molecular fossil of early life.
A second concern is related to the ionic composition of a marine environment.
The high salt concentration of the present ocean has the potential to exert signiﬁcant
osmotic pressure on any closed membrane system. All marine organisms today have
highly evolved membrane transport systems that allow them to maintain osmotic
equilibrium against substantial salt gradients across their membranes. Furthermore,
the concentrations of divalent cations, in particular Mg2+ and Ca2+ , were likely to
exceed 10 mM in the early oceans, similar to their concentrations in seawater today.
In the absence of oxygen, Fe2+ would also be present at millimolar concentrations,
rather than the micromolar levels in contemporary seawater. At concentrations
in the millimolar range, all such divalent cations have a strong tendency to bind
to the anionic head groups of amphiphilic molecules. This causes aggregation
and precipitation, strongly inhibiting the formation of stable membranes
(Monnard et al., 2002).
These considerations suggest that, from the perspective of membrane biophysics,
the most plausible planetary environment for the origin of life would be at moderate
temperature ranges (< 60 ◦ C), and the ionic content would correspond to low
ionic strength and pH values near neutrality (pH 5–8) with divalent cations at
submillimolar concentrations. This suggestion is in marked contrast to the view
that life most likely began in a marine environment, perhaps even the extreme
environment of a hydrothermal vent. One argument favouring a marine site for life’s
beginning is that fresh water would be rare on the early Earth. Even with today’s
extensive continental crust, fresh water only represents ∼1% of the contemporary

Emergent phenomena in biology: the origin of cellular life

Earth’s reservoir of liquid water. Another concern about a fresh water origin of
life is that the lifetime of fresh water bodies tends to be short on a geological time
scale. On the other hand, if sea water, with its high content of sodium chloride
and divalent ions, markedly inhibits self-assembly processes and reactions that are
essential to the emergence of cellular life, we may need to reconsider the assumption
that life inevitably began in a marine environment. A more plausible site for the
origin of cellular life may be a low ionic strength lacustrine environment such as
a pond or lake. After the ﬁrst form of cellular life was able to establish itself in a
relatively benign environment, it would rapidly begin to adapt through Darwinian
selection to more rigorous environments, including the extreme temperatures,
salt concentrations and pH ranges that we associate with the limits of life on
the Earth.

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for
the search for life in the universe

6.1 Introduction
Of the three big questions astrobiology addresses, none has captured the public
imagination as much as the question, ‘Are we alone?’As knowledge increases about
the physical environments available in the universe, organisms on the Earth are used
to gauge the minimum envelope for life. Organisms that live on the physical and
chemical (and perhaps, biological) boundaries are called ‘extremophiles’. Members
of the domain Archaea are undoubtedly the high-temperature champions on Earth,
surviving at temperatures far above the boiling point of water. However, a wide
phylogenetic variety of organisms are able to inhabit other extremes, from low
temperature to high salinity, from desiccation to high levels of radiation. In some
cases, the adaptation is as simple as keeping ions out of the cell (low pH), but
in others more profound adaptations are required. Reactive oxygen species are
highly toxic, and thus organisms that are aerobic are arguably extremophilic. Thus,
extraterrestrial habitats previously thought to be uninhabitable have been shown to
be, at least theoretically, habitable, thus informing the search for life elsewhere.
Extremophilic organisms, or ‘extremophiles’, are integral to understanding the
three big questions in astrobiology: Where do we come from? Where are we
going? Are we alone? We do not know the environmental conditions under which
life arose, although speculation includes hydrothermal areas; nor do we know the
environments in which the earliest life forms existed. The future study of life on this
planet and elsewhere is likely to include extremophiles, as our nearest neighbours
present environments that are, in many respects, extreme. Herein, I focus on the
importance of extremophiles for deﬁning the boundary conditions for life. The focus
will involve exploring the diversity of extremophiles, mechanisms for adaptation,
examples of extreme ecosystems, and space as an extreme environment.
Although this chapter contains examples of organisms that live in extreme
environments on Earth that overlap with environmental conditions found elsewhere,

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

this does not entail these organisms will be found elsewhere. In fact, if they were,
then their presence may be considered prima facie evidence of contamination,
as it is extraordinarily unlikely that identical organisms would be found on other
celestial bodies any other way. The critical point is that by studying extremophiles
on Earth, currently the only source of living organisms, we can deﬁne an envelope
for life in the Universe. We must be aware that this provides the minimum envelope
for life. The envelope is likely to be extended as we discover new organisms, and
life on Earth may not be able to or have had the opportunity to test all possible
environmental habitats.

6.2 What is an extremophile?
The word ‘extremophile’, coined by Bob MacElroy (1974) from the Latin
‘extremus’ and the Greek ‘philos’, literally means ‘lover of extremes’.
Unfortunately, even the deﬁnition is not as clear as one might think. Extreme is
usually taken to refer to physical, chemical, or, rarely, biological conditions. But
what is extreme?
There is an objective deﬁnition of extreme, owing to the fact that life on Earth is
based on organic carbon with water as a solvent. Thus, conditions that disrupt the
integrity or function of aqueous solutions of organic compounds are extreme.
Must extremophiles ‘love’extreme conditions? Scientists tend to be inconsistent;
when it comes to temperature, extremophiles thrive optimally at the extreme
temperatures. However, for many extremes, from pH to radiation, the extremophile
organisms grow well, or even grow better, under less-extreme conditions.
The ability to thrive under extreme conditions may be limited to particular life
stages. For example, some species of frogs, turtles, and snakes can tolerate freezing
of extracellular water, but only after the production of appropriate antifreeze
molecules in the autumn (Storey and Storey, 1996).
Which taxa contain extremophiles? With attention focused on temperature and
salt tolerance, biologists tend to equate Archaea with extremophiles. This is
inaccurate, as many extremophiles are Eubacteria and Eukarya, and additionally
an increasing number of non-extremophilic Archaea are being uncovered.
Reasons for studying extremophiles are listed in Table 6.1. Only the last ﬁve
are primarily or exclusively the territory of astrobiologists: the future use of
extremophiles in space – perhaps for life support, perhaps for terraforming; the
biodiversity of life on Earth, mechanisms to survive extreme environments, and
the limits for life in the universe.
It is interesting to note that extremophiles have been used to look for life in
the Universe not as a recent construct of astrobiology, but rather as a nineteenthcentury suggestion. Richard Proctor, a popular science writer for the public, was

probably the ﬁrst to connect the study of life in extreme environments and life on
other planets (Proctor, 1870, Chapter 1):
If we range over the [E]arth, from the arctic regions to the torrid zone, we ﬁnd that none of
the peculiarities which mark the several regions of our globe sufﬁce to banish life from its
surface.

While this chapter will focus almost exclusively on microbes, even humans inhabit
extreme environments, including outer space (for a fascinating review of human
adaptations to extreme environments, see Ashcroft (2001)).

6.3 Categories of extremophiles
The challenges posed by extreme environments range from physical factors such
as temperature and pressure to chemical extremes such as pH and oxygen tension
(reviewed in Rothschild and Mancinelli (2001); Table 6.2).

6.4 Environmental extremes
6.4.1 Temperature
Why should temperature make a difference to organisms? Organisms rely on
biomolecules, all of which will break down at some temperature. For example,
chlorophyll degrades near 75 ◦ C (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001). The melting
temperature of nucleic acids depends on the base composition (A–T bonds are less
thermostable than are G–C bonds), the length of the polymer, and the solvent
including the concentrations of ions in solution, but even DNA normally will
degrade well below 100 ◦ C.

As temperature increases, proteins denature, which results in loss of quaternary,
tertiary, and even secondary structures. This rules out their use as structural
compounds.
Denatured enzymes lose their catalytic activity. But even when active, enzymes
have a minimum, a maximum and an optimum temperature for function. By
deﬁnition, at temperatures above or below the maximum, enzymatic function slows.
The solubility of gases in a liquid, including water, varies depending on
temperature. As anyone who has opened a cold bottle of soda knows, the solubility
of gases in liquids decreases with increasing temperature. As aquatic organisms
often utilize soluble gases, such as CO2 or O2 , high temperature decreases the
availability of gases.
At low temperatures, water freezes. During freezing, solutes concentrate creating
high, perhaps toxic, concentrations of solutes. Once the water is frozen, the ice
crystals may act like tiny swords, piercing the cell membranes, and thus destroying
cellular integrity.
These effects of temperature on biological compounds strongly suggest that life
should have a fairly narrow temperature range, from above the freezing point of
water to well below its boiling point. Thus, it was surprising to Tom Brock when,
in July 1964, he detected living organisms in the run-off channels of hot springs in
Yellowstone National Park. Later in the summer he noticed pink, gelatinous mats
in Pool A of Octopus Spring, about six miles south of Old Faithful (Figure 6.1).
At the time ‘high temperature’ was considered to be 60 ◦ C. In 1966, Brock’s
graduate student, Hudson Freeze, cultured YT-1 (later known as Thermus aquaticus)
from Mushroom Spring. T. aquaticus is the source for Taq polymerase which,
when used as part of the polymerase chain reaction, revolutionized biology in
the late twentieth century. Inspired by reports of this work (Brock, 1967), as
well as the work of Woese (e.g., Woese and Fox (1977)) revealing the presence
of the Archaea, Karl Stetter became the leading ﬁgure in thermophile research
(see Chapter 7).
In 1977, the exploratory submarine Alvin travelled through the Panama Canal
for the ﬁrst time. Geological work in the Galapagos Rift was completed during
February and March. The major discovery of an abundance of exotic animal life
on and in the immediate proximity of warm water vents prompted theories about
the generation of life. Because no light can penetrate through the deep waters,
scientists concluded that the animal chemistry there is based on chemosynthesis,
not photosynthesis. Since then, Alvin has located more than 24 hydrothermal sites
in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans. It also has allowed researchers to ﬁnd and record
about 300 new species of animals, including bacteria, foot-long clams and mussels,
tiny shrimp, arthropods, and red-tipped tube worms that can grow up to 3 m long
in some vents.

bacterium, Thermocrinis ruber (Reysenbach et al., 1994; Huber et al., 1998). The
mats are growing at approximately 81 ◦ C. Note that Octopus is 7352 ft above
sea-level, and therefore the boiling point of water is depressed. In the front of
the photo is a section of the source, which is boiling, yet it too contains living
hyperthermophiles. Photo captured 3 August 2006.

The ability to withstand ﬁre is not normally considered an extreme-environment
adaption, but it is worth mention here. Fire-triggered germination is widespread in
the plant families Fabaceae, Rhamnaceae, Convolvulaceae, Malvaceae, Cistaceae,
and Sterculiaceae. The trigger is either heat shock or the chemical products of
combustion, rather than ﬁre itself (Keeley and Fotheringham, 1998).
The ability of organisms to thrive in cold temperature environments has a
much longer history. The great nineteenth-century microbiologist, Ferdinand Cohn,
noticed algae that grow on snow, a phenomenon often referred to as ‘watermelon
snow’ (Figure 6.2). Cold temperature organisms, or psychrophiles, were studied
from the marine environment by Certes in the 1980s and Conn in the early
twentieth century. ZoBell and his students – particularly Dick Morita – studied
these organisms and were the ﬁrst to get deep-sea samples from the 1957 Galathea
expeditions to ocean trenches. They were the ﬁrst to study these psychrophiles
and barophiles. By the 1980s, multiple ﬁeld campaigns were being staged to
the Dry Valleys of the Antarctic to study the microbes in the permanently
ice-covered lakes (Figure 6.3). These lakes were seen as a model system for

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

6.4.2 pH limits for life
The acidity of a solution, referred to as pH, quantiﬁes the activity of hydrogen ions.
In dilute solutions, the activity is approximately equal to the numeric value of the
concentration of the H+ ion, denoted as [H+ ]. Thus,

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

pH ∼ − log10 |[H+ ]|

(6.1)

Seawater (currently) has a pH of 8.2. This means that it has a [H+ ] of 10−8.2
mol l−1 , or approximately 6.31 × 10−9 mol l−1 . While the pH scale is thought of
as ranging from 0 to 14, a pH below 0 or above 14 is possible. For example, acid
mine run-off can have a pH of −3.6, corresponding to a molar concentration of H+
of 3981 M. The cytoplasm of most cells is near neutral, which is pH 7.
Life at pH extremes is difﬁcult. At low pH, in the absence of a proton pump,
hydrogen ions can rush into the cell, lowering the pH of the internal environment,
thereby disrupting the internal biochemistry of the cell. At extremely low pH,
proteins denature, which is the principle behind preservation at extremely low pH.
Organisms that live at high pH and use proton pumps ﬁnd it difﬁcult to locate
enough protons.
Yet, in spite of this, eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes from low pH
environments have been observed for several decades. The red alga, Cyanidium
caldarium (Fig. 6.3), can live at pH ∼ 0 (Seckbach, 1999). The Archaea Picrophilus
oshimae and Picrophilus torridus live in dry soils below pH 0.5 (Schleper et al.,
1995); and Ferroplasma acidarmanus, isolated from acid mine drainage, can
grow at pH 0 (Edwards et al., 2000). A diversity of organisms, from bacteria to
cyanobacteria to rotifers, can live at pH 10.5 (e.g., Martins et al. (2001)). Microbial
communities live at pH 12.9 in the soda lakes of Maqarin, Jordan (Pedersen et al.,
2004). It should be noted that soda lakes, in general, tend to be highly productive,
with high concentrations of cyanobacteria because of the high concentration of
dissolved CO2 (Grant et al., 1990; Rees et al., 2004).
Work on life at low pH started because of the use of acidic conditions for food
preservation (e.g., sauerkraut), but more recently low pH organisms have been
useful as model systems for biochemistry research. In the late 1960s in particular
(e.g., Seckbach et al. (1970)), but still to the present day, acidophiles have been
used as model systems for a potential life form on Venus (e.g., Schulze-Makuch
et al. (2004) and references therein).
The biotechnical potential also is enormous, as there are times in industrial
processes where it is most economical to conduct the reactions at either high or
low pH. An example of the economic signiﬁcance of these organisms comes from
the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), who planned to launch a multimillion dollar
legal claim against Genencor and Procter & Gamble, alleging that a microbial

cellulase enzyme illegally obtained from a soda lake in the country was used as an
ingredient in the latter company’s Tide laundry detergent (Sheridan, 2004).
6.4.3 Life in high salt
Red waters have been noted since biblical times, and Charles Darwin observed
red ponds in South America during his voyage on HMS Beagle. But halophiles,
organisms that live in 2–5 M salt, were ﬁrst noted in the early twentieth century
in conjunction with spoilage of food preserved in salt and yet red. In preparation
for the Viking missions to Mars, halophiles became of importance in the search
for life elsewhere. More recently, the discovery of evaporites on Mars and life in
evaporites on Earth, and the presumed radiation resistance of halophilic organisms
have also contributed to the astrobiological interest in halophiles (e.g., Rothschild
(1990), Rothschild et al. (1994), Forsythe and Zimbelman (1995), McLennan et al.
(2005)).
Halophiles are predominantly found among the Archaea and Bacteria. One
eukaryote, the green alga Dunaliella salina, is well known from a variety of
hypersaline environments. D. salina has been particularly useful commercially
because the glycerol and β-carotene that it accumulates can be harvested.
Halophiles are also desiccation resistant.

6.4.4 Desiccation (anhydrobiosis)
Desiccation is one of the oldest methods of food preservation. In ancient times,
the sun and wind would have dried foods naturally, as they do with grapes on the
vine producing raisins. There is evidence that the Middle Eastern cultures actively
dried food in the sun as early as 12 000 BCE. The Romans in particular were fond
of any dried fruit, but meats, especially pork, and cereal grains such as rice and
wheat, have been dried or smoked for millennia. Desiccation preserves because all
life on Earth relies heavily on the presence of liquid water, although it is possible
that some lichens can survive on water vapour.
So, as with the other extremophiles that we have considered here, many organisms
are extremely good at tolerating this extreme (Crowe et al., 1992). Many microbes
and plants use desiccation-resistant spores to weather dry periods and for dispersal.
A variety of invertebrates, including nematodes and rotifers, are anhydrobiotic
(Watanabe, 2006), and some, such as tardigrades, are known to survive desiccation
for well over 100 years dried on herbarium samples.
Organisms that can survive extreme dehydration are also resistant to freezing to
very low temperatures, elevated temperature for brief periods, and the effects of
ionizing radiation (Crowe and Crowe, 1992).

6.4.5 Pressure
Organisms can live at extraordinarily high pressures, as evidenced by the lush
microbial and invertebrate communities in the deep sea. Some of these organisms
can also survive normal atmospheric pressure, while others cannot. Interestingly,
the surface bacteria Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis have been shown
to be metabolically active up to 1600 MPa, substantially higher than ambient
pressure (0.1 MPa) (Sharma et al., 2002).

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

6.4.6 Radiation
Organisms are exposed to a variety of types of radiation on Earth. Some types
of radiation have been constant for organisms over geological time, such as
those from naturally occurring radioactive substances, while ultraviolet radiation
received by organisms has varied as the Sun has aged and atmospheric oxygen has
risen. Solar radiation exposure also varies seasonally and diurnally. Throughout
the history of Earth, ultraviolet radiation below 200 nm has been blocked from
reaching the surface by atmospheric CO2 . Since the rise of atmospheric oxygen
and ozone over 2 billion years ago (see Chapter 11), much of the radiation
below 300 nm has been attenuated as well. This is particularly important because
the peak absorption for nucleic acids is ∼260 nm and that for proteins is, on
average, ∼280 nm.
More recently, life has been exposed to radiation from man-made sources, such
as nuclear reactors. And, of course, with the advent of space exploration, organisms
from Earth have gone beyond its protective atmosphere to low orbit, the Moon, and,
now, beyond the edge of our Solar System as hitchhikers on the Voyager spacecraft.
Radioactivity, a term coined by Marie Curie, was found to be hazardous to living
organisms very quickly after the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Roentgen in
1895. Radiation damages nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids directly and indirectly
through the production of reactive oxygen radicals. While the types of radiation
vary, the types of damage are similar, ranging from modiﬁed bases to singlestrand and double-strand breaks. With oxidative damage, oxidation of lipids and
proteins can also occur. Thus, in 1956, when a can of γ radiation-sterilized
meat surprisingly spoiled, Arthur W. Anderson at Oregon Agricultural Experiment
Station in Corvallis, investigated and found the culprit: the aerobic bacterium
Deinococcus radiodurans.
D. radiodurans is not just phenomenally radiation-resistant, but it is also
desiccation-resistant. This has led to the hypothesis that the radiation resistance
is incidental to desiccation resistance (Battista, 1997). Certainly organisms that
are desiccated are not able to repair DNA damage; so, upon rehydration, there is
pressure to repair the accumulated damage rapidly.

6.4.7 High oxygen
High oxygen seems an odd addition to a list of extreme parameters; are we not
exquisitely adapted to living in 21% oxygen? In fact, oxygen levels on Earth are
thought to have been as high as 35% during the Permo-Carboniferous, 248–354
million years ago (Berner et al., 2003), deep into the age of multicellular life.
Although we consider an aerobic lifestyle to be ‘normal’, I will argue that, in
reality, oxygen presents one of the most severe challenges to organisms based on
organic carbon, concluding that we, like all aerobes, are extremophiles.
Aerobic metabolism arose and became dominant because it is far more efﬁcient
than anaerobic metabolism, generating 18 times more ATP per molecule of glucose
metabolized. However, during the reduction of oxygen to water, or the oxidation
of water, a series of reactive oxygen species is produced, the worst of which, for a
biological system, is the hydroxyl radical (·OH). These reactions, from oxygen to
the superoxide anion (O−
2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), the hydroxyl radical (·OH),
and H2 O, are shown in Equation (6.2).
O2 ↔ O2− ↔ H2 O2 ↔ OH ↔ H2 O

(6.2)

Oxidative damage to DNA is well known and includes modiﬁcation of bases
to single-strand breaks to double-strand breaks. Reactive oxygen species also
cause damage to lipids and proteins. Current research suggests that the increased
production of reactive oxygen species is a feature of most, if not all, human disease,
including cardiovascular disease and cancer (Jacob and Burri, 1996).

6.5 How do they do it?
Sometimes, evolution ﬁnds the route of the least number of changes, which I dub
‘the laziness principle’. If the internal environment of a cell alters radically, there
would have to be a massive reworking of the internal environment necessitating
massive changes in the biomolecules and possibly pathways.
For these reasons, the simplest approach to living in extreme environments is to
keep the external environment out. This is what we do by wearing clothes, mammals
do by growing fur, and so on. Living under protective materials, such as sand or
salt, is another strategy (Rothschild and Giver, 2003). A similar approach is taken to
living at low pH. Acidophiles maintain a roughly neutral internal pH by evolving a
strong proton pump or having low permeability to protons. Conversely, alkaliphiles
(organisms that live at high pH) maintain an internal pH two or more units below
the external medium by evolving an effective proton transport system.
As with pH, a variety of organisms can withstand anhydrobiosis, suggesting that
this adaptation is relatively straightforward to evolve. Usually the synthesis of a

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

disaccharide such as trehalose in microbes, animals, and fungi, or sucrose in plants,
is sufﬁcient to survive desiccation (Crowe et al., 1992). Trehalose may provide
effective protection against desiccation because it has superior biochemical and
physicochemical properties for stabilizing membranes and biomolecules including
proteins and lipids (Watanabe, 2006) by hydrogen bonding to polar residues in the
dry macromolecular assemblages (Crowe et al., 1998). However, both trehalose and
sucrose form glasses in the dry state; so it has been suggested that glass formation
(vitriﬁcation) is in itself sufﬁcient to stabilize dry biomolecules (Sun et al., 1998).
Crowe et al. (1998) have shown that, while vitriﬁcation is required, it is not in itself
sufﬁcient to allow anhydrobiosis.
A further complication arises because anhydrobiosis occurs in the absence of
trehalose or other disaccharides in bdelloid rotifers (Lapinski and Tunnacliffe,
2003). Thus, there may be alternative pathways to desiccation resistance.
Similarly, halophiles often are able to cope by the accumulation of a compatible
solute. The internal osmotica include K+ for Archaea, glycine betaine and organic
compounds in Bacteria, and glycerol in the eukaryote Dunaliella salina.
If the external environment cannot be kept out, sometimes small modiﬁcations
can be made to the internal environment. For example, enzyme activities can adapt
to lower temperatures, and the lipid composition of the membrane can be altered
to avoid loss of ﬂuidity at low temperatures. At temperatures below freezing, ice
forms, which is doubly dangerous. First, as the ice forms, it removes water and
increases the concentration of solutes in the remaining water. Second, ice crystals
themselves can cause physical damage to cell membranes. Antifreeze molecule(s)
can prevent this damage. For example, the accumulation of glycerol in frogs allows
natural tolerance to freezing (Schmid, 1982), as do the antifreeze proteins in ﬁsh
provide the same function (e.g., Davies and Hew (1990), Clarke (2003)).
High temperature is normally lethal for a number of reasons, ranging from
lowered solubility of gases at high temperature, to denaturation of proteins and
nucleic acids. High temperature can be avoided by use of cold water circulation
over the exterior, such as in the pompei worm. However, hyperthermophiles are
required to make multiple changes to their internal biochemistry for survival. Salt
bridges have long been known to stabilize proteins in thermophiles (Perutz, 1978).
With increasing temperature, prokaryotes tend to acquire adenine and lose cytosine,
while keeping thymine and guanosine relatively constant (Lambros et al., 2003).
Because of the economic interest in hyperthermophiles, this is an active area of
interest.
Resistance to radiation damage, and the related phenomenon of oxidative
damage, is critical for life. Thus, multiple pathways exist in all organisms
(reviewed extensively elsewhere; e.g., Yasui and McCready (1998), Petit and Sancar
(1999), Smith (2004)). These include photorepair, excision repair, and homologous

recombinational repair, among others. However, the key to the remarkable ability
of D. radiodurans to resist radiation might be the fact that the DNA is held in a
ring-like structure, thus enabling the cell to ligate the broken strands in the correct
order (Levin-Zaidman et al., 2003), although its ability to accumulate manganese
while keeping a low intracellular level of iron also may be a contributing factor to
resistance (Daly et al., 2004).

6.6 Examples of extreme ecosystems

Even excluding our nearly ubiquitous high oxygen terrestrial environment,
there is a remarkable diversity of extreme habitats on Earth (Table 6.2;
Figures 6.1–6.4). These range from the ice at the poles to the searing heat of
hydrothermal vents. Paralana Spring, in the Flinders Ranges of Australia, bubbles
radioactivity (Figure 6.4). As suggested above, many of these have multiple
extreme environments simultaneously. Thus, while the source of Octopus Springs
in Yellowstone National Park is at the boilina pH ∼8.2, a pH similar to that of the
ocean, Congress Springs also is boiling but with a pH of near 0. Laguna Colorada,
a hypersaline lake in the Bolivian Altiplano, has a moderately alkaline pH of 8.4,
but is hypersaline and, thus, populated by halophiles. At an altitude of 4364 m,
and a location of 22 ◦ 15.836 S; 67 ◦ 48.970 W, the organisms are also subjected

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

to exceptionally high levels of UVB radiation in the austral summer (Rothschild,
unpublished).
An extreme environment that is poorly studied is that of the air. An airborne organism must deal with the effects of desiccation, decreasing temperature,
ultraviolet radiation, and a nutrient-poor environment. Of course, with increasing
elevation, oxygen decreases as well. The great microbiologist Louis Pasteur did
some of the early work on aerobiology, but current work is conducted primarily
for military reasons, to investigate spread of air-borne pathogens, and to preserve
monuments.
While many extreme environments occur naturally, there are new, human-made
environments as well. In particular, nuclear reactors (high radiation) and acid mine
drainage (high metals, low pH) can provide novel challenges.

6.7 Space: new categories of extreme environments
Assuming that all organisms on Earth are indigenous to this planet, outer space
provides new extreme environments. Life beyond Earth is difﬁcult for at least six
reasons.

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

(i) Atmospheric composition is likely to be grossly different.
(ii) Gravity can range from nearly zero to lower than on Earth on other rocky planets
(although higher on the gas giants).
(iii) Space itself is almost a vacuum.
(iv) Temperature extremes occur even in our planetary neighbourhood.
(v) Nutrient sources are different and may well be non-existent.
(vi) The radiation regimes are grossly different.

Cosmic and solar particle radiation are non-existent on Earth, but quickly
add to the woes of increased ultraviolet ﬂux beyond Earth’s atmosphere and
magnetosphere.
A series of experiments has been conducted, primarily by the Europeans under
the aegis of the ESA, to test the ability of terrestrial organisms to withstand the
rigours of space. The ﬁrst studies were done on balloons and rockets, and, later,
on spacecraft in low Earth orbit and outside the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (Apollo
missions 16 and 17). The low Earth orbit experiments have been conducted on a
variety of platforms including Spacelab 1, Spacelab D2, the Exobiology Radiation
Assembly (ERA) on the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), NASA’s Long
Duration Exposure-Facility (LDEF), and Biopan on the Russian satellite Foton.
From 1994 to 2006, 25 exobiology experiments were performed on Biopan, an
ESA space-exposure platform on a satellite, allowing two-week ﬂight opportunities
(Schulte et al., 2006). Samples were exposed to the rigours of outer space vacuum

and the resulting desiccation and radiation regime. Plans are ﬁnalized for a similar
exposure facility to be attached to the outside of the International Space Station
in 2007. The plan is that EXPOSE will allow one-year experiments. Isolated short
duration experiments continue (e.g., Saffary et al. (2002)).
Early on Horneck showed that the spores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis
could survive such exposure (e.g., Horneck et al. (1984), Horneck (1993, 1999)).
Since then, bacterial spores mixed with Mars soil analogues, permafrost soil
samples with their embedded bacterial spores, and viruses also have survived. But,
whereas spores are expected to be particularly resistant to environmental extremes
(e.g., Nicholson et al. (2000)), Mancinelli et al. (1998) were the ﬁrst to show
survival of cells in the vegetative state. Since then, lichens and yeast have also been
shown to survive space travel.
6.8 Life in the Solar System?
While planet Earth is the only body in the Solar System, indeed our Universe, that
we know to be infested with life, there are several other possible habitats. Assuming
that liquid water is a necessity (see Benner et al. (2004) and Shulze-Makuch and
Irwin (2004) for a discussion of this and alternatives), there are two planets (Venus
and Mars), and several moons (e.g., Europa and Enceladus) that currently are the
most-likely candidates to harbour life (see Chapter 5). If one assumes that an organic
solvent, such as methane alone or in combination with water, could be a solvent for
life, then the search extends to Titan.

6.8.1 Venus
While Proctor and others have discussed the possibility of an extant Venusian
biosphere, most people believe Venus to be sterile today. The surface of Venus is
the hottest in the Solar System at 477 ◦ C, so there is no liquid water. This was caused
by a run-away greenhouse effect where the carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere (96%
CO2 with 3% N2 ) trapped incident sunlight raising temperatures. Additionally,
clouds of sulphuric acid abound and the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that
of Earth at sea level. The information we have on the surface of Venus was obtained
from the Russian Venera landers from the 1980s, which survived on the surface for
about 60 minutes. Additional information has been gained from NASA’s Magellan
spacecraft, the Russian Venera orbiters and the ESA’s Venus Express mission, which
entered Venusian orbit on 11 April 2006.
In many ways, Venus began as Earth’s close sister, perhaps even ‘twin’. Although
Venus is approximately 30% closer to the Sun than the Earth, it is similar in size,
mass, density, and volume. Venus coalesced out of the same materials as the Earth
and should have a similar bombardment history, so it is likely to have been similar

Extremophiles: deﬁning the envelope for the search for life in the universe

when the planets formed. Since life arose on Earth by 3.8 billion years ago, and
quite possibly much earlier, it is reasonable to assume that life could have arisen
on Venus during that time as well. And, if life is not indigenous to Venus, transport
from Earth or Mars during the time may have been possible (Gladman et al., 2005).
Unfortunately, reworking of the Venusian surface means that it is unlikely that we
will ever know for certain.
First Sagan (1961) and more recently Cockell (1999), Grinspoon and SchulzeMakuch and others (e.g., Schulze-Makuch et al. (2004)) have envisioned a scenario
where life could still be present on Venus. While the surface pressure and
concentration of CO2 , though high, does not prohibit life, the high temperature
does. However, in the lower and middle cloud layers of Venus, the temperatures
are lower and water vapour is available, and thus these clouds could provide a
refuge for life. Perhaps acidophilic sulphate-reducing chemoautotrophs suspended
as aerosols could survive there even today. Ultraviolet radiation ﬂux would be
high, but Schulze-Makuch et al. (2004) have suggested a way that the ﬂux could
be attenuated allowing life to survive.

6.8.2 Mars
Mars is half again as far from the Sun as the Earth. Its mass is 0.12 that of the Earth,
so there is one-sixth the gravity on the surface. As is the case for Venus, early Mars
was similar to early Earth, and therefore if life is inevitable, or even likely, under
early Earth conditions, it ought to have arisen on Mars as well. Unlike Venus, or
even Earth, preservation of early fossils is possible, and, thus, Mars is a tantalizing
target for palaeontologists.
The interest in extant life on Mars continued well into the twentieth century,
inspired in part by the discovery of canali on Mars in 1877 by Giovanni Schiaparelli
in Milan (see Zahnle (2001) for the history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century
views of the habitability of Mars). It was NASA’s Mariner IV mission, which gave
the ﬁrst close-up glimpse of the Martian surface, that ﬁnally destroyed all hope of
a civilization on Mars or even extensive vegetation. Mariner IV arrived at Mars
on 14 July 1965 and returned photos showing a heavily cratered barren landscape.
In addition, the thinness of the atmosphere was realized.
The 1960s ended on a different note with Mariner 9’s superior photos revealing
gigantic volcanoes and a grand canyon stretching 4800 km across its surface.
More surprisingly, the relics of ancient riverbeds were carved in the landscape
of this seemingly dry and dusty planet. Thus, attention turned to the possibility
of microbial life on Mars, even extant life. NASA’s Viking landers arrived at
Mars in 1976 with a variety of life detection experiments: a camera and a gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to detect organic compounds, and

three metabolic experiments: labelled release, pyrolytic release, and gas exchange.
While the approach was clever and the performance was excellent, unambiguous
signs of life were not detected. Worse, organic carbon was not detected by the
GC-MS. Lack of surface water and strong surface oxidants were suspected to be
the culprits. Attention in the exobiology community turned to the possibility of
ﬁnding signs of extinct life.
More recently, the possibility of extant microbial life has been revived. And,
whether the Mars meteorite ALH84001 indeed harbours an extinct Martian biota
(McKay et al., 1996) or has only whetted our appetite for further studies, it
remains one of the most exciting science stories of the twentieth century. The
life forms would be found in the polar ice caps, in subsurface communities, in
hydrothermal systems or in endoliths or evaporites (Rothschild, 1990). Terrestrial
analogues exist for all of these potential life forms, and all circumvent the high
ﬂux of ultraviolet radiation on the surface. Primarily for these reasons, and the
likelihood of eventual human settlement, Mars remains a prime target for missions,
if not speciﬁcally to look for life, then to better understand the environment of
the planet. By understanding the environment, habitability can be gauged. These
include NASA’s Mars Pathﬁnder, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, the Mars
Exploration Rovers, and ESA’s Mars Express. Sadly the British-designed Beagle 2
lander which was intended speciﬁcally to look for life, failed to communicate with
Mars Express after its release in December 2003, and is now presumed ‘dead’.

6.8.3 Europa
If water is the sine qua non for life, any body known to have liquid water instantly
becomes a prime target in the search for life. For years it was thought that any
body far from the Sun would not be able to harbour liquid water, but today there
are several moons beyond Mars thought to contain liquid water beneath an icy
covering. The best known of these is Europa.
Europa was discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 along with Jupiter’s other three
large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto. In 1951, using Earth-based telescopes,
H. Jeffreys proposed that Callisto might be partially or totally composed of water in
the form of ice. This was suggested by Callisto’s very low density and also its albedo.
The presence of frost or ice on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto was conﬁrmed by
using infrared reﬂectivity observed from the solar telescope at Kitt Peak National
Observatory. John Lewis (1971) and, later, others suggested that there could be a
liquid water ocean beneath an icy crust. First the Voyager spacecraft, and, since the
1990s, NASA’s Galileo spacecraft, have returned photos of ice-covered surfaces
with coloured cracks (reviewed in Greenberg and Geissler (2002) and Greenberg
(2005)). Current thinking focuses on the idea of a liquid water ocean beneath an icy

crust that is under 50 million years old, so is actively resurfacing (Khurana et al.,
2002). The ocean is maintained by tidal resonance with Io and Ganymede and tidal
friction with Jupiter.
As soon as it became known that there might be liquid water on Europa
discussions began on the possibility that there might also be life there. Guy
Consolmagno, who worked on the theoretical models of oceans on Europa,
Ganymede, and Callisto with John Lewis at MIT, included an appendix in his
1975 Master’s thesis ‘Thermal history models of icy satellites’, where he suggested
that Europa could have the beginnings of organic chemistry if the rocky core is
as rich in carbon as some of the primitive meteorites. He concluded by writing
‘. . . we stop short of postulating life forms in these mantles; we leave such to
others more experienced than ourselves in such speculations.’ Since then a dozen
or so papers have appeared with similar speculations, including Gaidos et al.
(1999), Chyba and Phillips (2002), and Greenberg (2005). While pictures of large
invertebrates prowling the Europan ocean have entered the popular imagination,
a more constrained microbial biosphere is widely discussed. Future missions,
though long and expensive compared to Mars missions, are ardently desired.

6.8.4 Enceladus
Suddenly in March 2006 there was a new body in the Solar System in the ranks of
suspected harbourers of life (Porco et al., 2006). Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn,
orbits in the outermost ring, the E ring. The Cassini mission had revealed a cloud of
oxygen in the E ring, and Enceladus was suspected to be the source. Enceladus is
thought to have an internal heat source and is geologically active, resulting in cold
geysers that throw out water vapour and ice. The water decomposes into clouds of
oxygen. Thus, there may be large pools of liquid water beneath the surface, and
where there is water, the possibility for life exists.
6.9 Conclusions
Life ‘as we know it’ — and are likely to know it — is based on organic carbon.
Furthermore, water is the solvent that supports life on Earth and, again, is likely to
be used elsewhere, although the certainty is not quite as high as the argument for
organic carbon. Based on these facts alone, environments that would be challenging
to any life form exist.
The story of the so-called extremophiles is a conglomeration of many stories
gathered for a multitude of purposes over the years. They reveal an envelope for
life that is far beyond what we could have imagined 40 or even 10 years ago. For
this reason, the potential habitats for life in the Universe have also expanded.

Some of the adaptations that organisms have made on Earth to these extreme
environments are relatively simple from an evolutionary viewpoint, whereas others
have required a suite of evolutionary changes. Particularly in the former case,
examples of convergent evolution to solve the same problem the same way are
known. Convergence suggests a relative simplicity to the adaptation, and thus
increases the likelihood that it could occur elsewhere.
While it is impossible to predict whether extremophiles will be found elsewhere,
two things are of near certainty. Terrestrial extremophiles will be among the ﬁrst
settlers of extraterrestrial bodies and the environmental limits for life presented here
will someday be extended through further exploration of extreme environments on
Earth.

Hyperthermophilic life on Earth – and on Mars?
Karl O. Stetter
Universität Regensburg

7.1 Introduction
Every living organism is adapted to a speciﬁc growth temperature. In the case
of humans, this is 37 ◦ C and an increase by 5 ◦ C becomes fatal. In the world
of microbes, the growth temperature range is much more diverse: heat lovers
(‘thermophiles’) grow optimally (fastest) at temperatures up to 65 ◦ C (Brock, 1978;
Castenholz, 1979). Since the time of Pasteur, it had been assumed generally that
growing (vegetative) cells of bacteria were killed quickly by temperatures of 80 ◦ C
and above. The Pasteurization technology is based on this observation. In contrast,
during the past few decades, hyperthermophiles (HT; Stetter, 1992) that exhibit
unprecedented optimal growth temperatures in excess of 80 ◦ C have been isolated
(Stetter et al., 1981; Zillig et al., 1981; Stetter, 1982). HT turned out to be very
common in hot terrestrial and submarine environments. In comparing the growth
requirements of these present-day HT with the conditions on ancient Earth, similar
organisms could or even should have existed already by Early Archaean times.
Propelled by impact energy, microbes could have spread in between the planets
and moons of the early Solar System. Is there any evidence for the existence of
microbes at that time? Most likely, yes. But the recognition of ancient microfossils
on the basis of morphology turned out to be difﬁcult, leading to controversy.
Nevertheless, there are chemical traces of life within rocks from Precambrian
deep sea vents (Schopf et al., 1987; Brasier et al., 2002; van Zullen et al.,
2002).
In my research, I search for HT, their environments, properties, and modes of
living. So far, I have gathered a collection of more than 1500 strains of HT, among
them are isolates that survive autoclaving at 121 ◦ C. Whether such organisms are
growing slowly or just surviving at 121 ◦ C is unresolved (Blöchl et al., 1997;
Kasheﬁ and Lovley, 2003; Cowan, 2004).

Hyperthermophilic life on Earth – and on Mars?

7.2 Biotopes
HT form complex communities within water-containing geothermally and
volcanically heated environments situated mainly along terrestrial and submarine
tectonic spreading and subduction zones. Availability of liquid water is a
fundamental prerequisite of life. At an increased boiling point of water (for example
by elevated atmospheric, hydrostatic or osmotic pressure), several HT exhibit
growth temperatures exceeding 100 ◦ C. Due to the presence of reducing gasses
like H2 S and the low solubility of O2 at high temperatures, the biotopes of HT
essentially are oxygen-free (anaerobic). HT have been isolated from terrestrial and
submarine environments.

7.2.1 Terrestrial biotopes

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Natural terrestrial biotopes of HT are mainly hot springs and sulfur-containing
solfataric ﬁelds (named after Solfatara, Italy), with a wide range of pH values
(pH 0–9) and usually low salinity (0.1–0.5%). Solfataric ﬁelds consist of soils, mud
holes, and surface waters, heated by volcanic exhalations from magma chambers
several kilometres below (Figure 7.1). Very often, solfataric ﬁelds are found close
to active volcanoes and activity increases greatly during eruption phases. The
chemical composition of solfataric ﬁelds is very variable and site-dependent.
Many are rich in iron minerals, like ferric hydroxides and pyrite. Less usual
compounds may be enriched at some sites, with magnetite and arsenic minerals like

realgar and auripigment in Caldera Uzon, Kamchatka. Hydrogen may be formed
either pyrolytically from water or chemically from FeS and H2 S (Drobner et al.,
1990). Steam within the solfataric exhalations is responsible mainly for the heat
transfer. In addition, sites may contain carbon dioxide, variable amounts of H2 ,
methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and traces of nitrate and ammonia. Active
volcanoes may harbour hot-water lakes, which are heated by fumaroles. Usually,
those abound in sulfur and are very acidic. Other suitable biotopes for HT are
deep, subterranean, geothermally heated oil stratiﬁcations, approximately 3500 m
below the bottom of the North Sea and the surface of the permafrost soil at the
North Slope, Northern Alaska (Stetter et al., 1993). The ﬂuids produced in these
regions contained up to 107 viable cells per litre of different species of HT. Artiﬁcial
biotopes include smouldering coal refuse piles and hot outﬂows from geothermal
and nuclear power plants.

7.2.2 Marine biotopes
Marine biotopes of HT consist of various hydrothermal systems situated at shallow
to abyssal depths. Similar to ambient seawater, submarine hydrothermal systems
usually contain high concentrations of NaCl and sulfate and exhibit a slightly
acidic to alkaline pH (5.0–8.5). Otherwise, the major gases and life-supporting
mineral nutrients can be similar to those in terrestrial thermal areas. Shallow
submarine hydrothermal systems are found in many parts of the world, mainly on
beaches with active volcanism, like at Vulcano Island, Italy, with temperatures of
80 to 105 ◦ C.
Most impressive are the deep sea ‘smoker’ vents (Figure 7.2), where mineralladen hydrothermal ﬂuids with temperatures up to approximately 400 ◦ C escape
into the cold (2.8 ◦ C), surrounding deep sea water and build up huge rock chimneys.
Although these hot ﬂuids are sterile, the surrounding porous smoker rock material
appears to contain very steep temperature gradients, which provide zones of suitable
growth temperatures for HT. Some smoker rocks are teeming with HT (for example
108 cells of Methanopyrus per gram of rock inside a Mid Atlantic Snake Pit hot
vent chimney). Deep sea vents are located along submarine tectonic fracture zones
(for example the ‘TAG’ and ‘Snake Pit’ sites situated at the Mid Atlantic Ridge in a
depth of about 4000 m). Another type of submarine high temperature environment
is provided by active sea mounts. Close to Tahiti, there is a huge abyssal volcano,
Macdonald Seamount (28◦ 58.7 S, 140 ◦ 15.5 W), the summit of which is situated
approximately 40 meters below the sea surface. Samples taken during an active
phase from the submarine eruption plume and rocks from the active crater contained
high concentrations of viable HT (Huber et al., 1990).

7.3 Sampling and cultivation
Samples of possible HT containing hot waters, soils, rock and sediments may serve
as primary material to set-up enrichment cultures in the laboratory. Special care has
to be taken to avoid contamination of the sample by oxygen. In the presence of high
temperatures of growth, it is toxic to anaerobic HT. In contrast, at low temperatures
(for example: 4 ◦ C) in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic HT may survive for years.
Transportation and shipping can be performed at ambient temperature. In the lab,
anaerobic samples (in tightly stoppered 100 ml storage bottles and stored at 4 ◦ C)
can be used for successful enrichment cultures at least for 10 years.
Enrichment cultures can be obtained by simulating the varying geochemical and
geophysical composition of the environments. Various plausible electron donors
and acceptors may be used under anaerobic, microaerophilic, or aerobic culture
conditions. Depending on the (unknown) initial cell concentration and the doubling
time of the organism, positive enrichment cultures of HT can be identiﬁed by
microscopy within 1–7 days. For a deeper understanding of the organisms, the
study of pure cultures is required. Due to the high incubation temperatures, the
traditional manner of cloning by plating does not perform well in HT (even by
using heat stable polymers like Gelrite). Therefore, we developed a new procedure
for cloning single cells under the laser microscope, by employing optical tweezers
(Ashkin and Dziedzic, 1987; Huber et al., 1995). Large cell masses are required for
biochemical and biophysical investigations. For mass culturing of HT, a new type
of high temperature fermentor was invented in collaboration with an engineering

company (Figure 7.3). Its steel casing is enamel-protected in order to resist the
highly corrosive culture conditions. Sharp-edged parts like stirrers, gasing and
sampling pipes and condensers are made of titanium. The cell yield of a 300 l
fermentation may vary from approximately 3 g to 2 kg (wet weight), depending on
the HT isolate.

7.4 Phylogenetic implications
Hot volcanic environments are among the oldest biotopes existing on Earth. What
is known about the phylogenetic relationships of the organisms living there? Based
on the pioneering work of Carl Woese, the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ss-rRNA)
is widely used in phylogenetic studies of prokaryotes (Woese and Fox, 1977; Woese
et al., 1990). It consists of approximately 1500 nucleotides and is homologous to
its eukaryotic counterpart. On the basis of sequence comparisons, a phylogenetic
tree is now available (Figure 7.4). It shows a tripartite division of the living world
into the bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryal domains. Within this tree, deep branches
are evidence for early separation. The separation of the Bacteria from the stem
shared by Archaea and Eukarya represents the deepest and earliest branching
point. Short phylogenetic branches indicate a rather slow rate of evolution.
In contrast to the eukaryal domain, the bacterial and archaeal domains within the
phylogenetic tree exhibit some extremely short and deep branches. Surprisingly,

those are covered exclusively by hyperthermophiles, which therefore form a cluster
around the phylogenetic root (Figure 7.4, bulky lineages). The deepest and shortest
phylogenetic branches are represented by the Aquiﬁcales and Thermotogales within
the Bacteria and the Nanoarchaeota, Pyrodictiaceae, and Methanopyraceae within
the Archaea. Long lineages represent mesophilic and moderately thermophilic
Bacteria and Archaea (e.g., Gram-positives, Proteobacteria; Halobacteriales;
Methanosarcinaceae) indicating their ss-rRNA had experienced a fast rate of
evolution. Now, several total genome sequences are available. Phylogenetic
trees based on genes involved in information management (for example, DNA
replication, transcription, translation) parallel the ss-rRNA tree. Genes involved in
metabolism, however, are prone to frequent lateral gene transfer, and a network
rather than a tree might reﬂect their phylogenetic relations (Doolittle, 1999).

7.5 Physiologic properties

141

To date, approximately 90 species of HT Archaea and Bacteria, which had been
isolated from different terrestrial and marine thermal areas in the world, are known.
HT are very divergent, both in their phylogeny and physiological properties and
are grouped into 34 genera and 10 orders (Boone and Castenholz, 2001).

7.5 Physiologic properties
7.5.1 Energy sources

Copyright   2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Most species of HT exhibit a chemolithoautotrophic mode of nutrition. Inorganic
redox reactions serve as energy sources (chemolithotrophic), and CO2 is the
only carbon source required to build up organic cell material (autotrophic).
Therefore, these organisms ﬁx CO2 by chemosynthesis and are designated
chemolithoautotrophs. The energy-yielding reactions in chemolithoautotrophic HT
are those involved in anaerobic and aerobic respiration (Figure 7.5). Molecular
hydrogen serves as an important electron donor. Other electron donors are sulﬁde,
sulfur, and ferrous iron. As in mesophilic respiratory organisms, in some HT,
oxygen may serve as an electron acceptor. In contrast, however, oxygen-respiring
HT are usually microaerophilic and, therefore, grow only at reduced oxygen
concentrations. Anaerobic respiration types are the nitrate-, sulfate-, sulfur- and
carbon dioxide-types. While chemolithoautotrophic HT produce organic matter,
there are some HT that depend on organic material as energy and carbon
sources. They are designated as heterotrophs. Several chemolithoautotrophic HT
are opportunistic heterotrophs. These are able to use organic material alternatively
to inorganic nutrients whenever they are available from the environment (e.g., by

7.5.2 General physiologic properties
HT are adapted to environmental factors including composition of minerals and
gases, pH, redox potential, salinity and temperature. Similar to mesophiles, they
grow within a temperature range of about 25–30 ◦ C between the minimal and
maximal growth temperature (Table 7.1). Fastest growth is obtained at their optimal
growth temperature, which may be up to 106 ◦ C. Generally, HT do not propagate
at 50 ◦ C or below. Although unable to grow at the low ambient temperatures, they
are able to survive for years. Based on their simple growth requirements, HT could
grow on any hot, wet place, even on other planets and moons of our solar system,
like Mars and Europa. Today, the surface of Mars is too cold and contains no liquid
water and therefore is hostile to life as it is known on Earth. However, in a depth
of a few kilometres below the permafrost layer, there may be hot liquid water and
nutrients to support growth of HT. Life could have spread onto Mars via meteorites
during the great bombardment, about 4 GA ago. At that time, the surface of Mars
had been much hotter and contained liquid water, therefore being favourable to HT.

7.6 Examples of recent HT organisms
Within the Bacteria domain, the deepest phylogenetic branch is represented
by the HT Aquifex (Huber et al., 1992). Its type species Aquifex pyrophilus
is a motile rod-shaped chemolithoautotroph (Figure 7.6). It is a facultative
microaerophilic anaerobe. Under anaerobic conditions, Aquifex pyrophilus grows

by nitrate reduction with H2 and S0 as electron donors. Alternatively, at very low
oxygen concentrations (up to 0.5%, after adaptation), it is able to gain energy by
oxidation of H2 and S0 , using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Members of Aquifex
are found in shallow submarine vents. Aquifex pyrophilus grows up to 95 ◦ C, the
highest growth temperature observed within the Bacteria (Table 7.1).
From the walls of a black smoker at the Mid Atlantic Ridge, we had isolated
the archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii (Blöchl et al., 1997). Cells are lobed cocci,
approximately 0.7–2.5 µm in diameter (Figure 7.7). The species Pyrolobus fumarii
is adapted optimally to temperatures of superheated water, exhibiting an optimal
growth temperature of 106 ◦ C (Figure 7.8) and an upper temperature border of
growth at 113 ◦ C. It is so dependent to high temperatures that it is unable to grow
below 90 ◦ C. Cultures of Pyrolobus fumarii, similar to Pyrodictium occultum are
able to survive autoclaving for one hour at 121 ◦ C. A very closely related isolate
(‘strain 121’) exhibits the same optimal growth temperature (106 ◦ C), but has been
reported to grow slowly even at 121 ◦ C (Kasheﬁ and Lovley, 2003). However, this
result has not been conﬁrmed.

host, a new member of the genus Ignicoccus (Figure 7.9). Owing to their unusual
ss-rRNA sequence, members of Nanoarchaeum equitans remained undetectable by
commonly used ‘universal’ primers in ecological studies based on the polymerase
chain reaction. However, two different ss-rRNA genes could be detected in
a coculture-derived DNA by Southern blot hybridization, by taking advantage
of the generally high sequence homology of all ss-rRNA genes (about 75%
similarity). After sequencing of the total genome, the phylogenetic relationships
of Nanoarchaeum equitans could be investigated by concatenating and aligning
the amino acid sequences of 35 ribosomal proteins (Waters et al., 2003). The
species Nanoarchaeum equitans was placed with high support at the most deeply
branching position within the Archaea, suggesting that the Nanoarchaeota diverged
early within the Archaea. With only 490 885 base pairs, the Nanoarchaeum
equitans genome is the smallest microbial genome known to date and also the
most compact, with 95% of the DNA predicted to encode proteins and stable
RNAs. It harbours the complete machinery for information processing and repair,
but lacks genes for lipid, cofactor, amino acid, and nucleotide biosynthesis. The
limited biosynthetic and catabolic capacity suggests that the symbiotic relationship
of Nanoarchaeum equitans to its Ignicoccus hospitalis host may be parasitic,
making it the only known archaeal parasite. Unlike the small genomes of bacterial
parasites, however, which are undergoing reductive evolution, the small genome
of Nanaoarchaeum equitans has very few pseudogenes and a well-equipped DNA
recombination system. Therefore, it may be a very ancient parasite. Alternatively,
the Ignicoccus hospitalis–Nanoarchaeum equitans system could be remains

from pre-Archaea communities, as postulated earlier (Kandler, 1994). At the
molecular level, Nanoarchaeum equitans harbours further unexpected, most likely
primitive properties, like separately encoded enzyme modules and – for the ﬁrst
time – t RNA gene fragments (Waters et al., 2003; Randau et al., 2005). Currently,
we possess only rudimentary understanding of the Nanoarchaeum equitans –
Ignicoccus hospitalis relationship. The Nanoarchaeota are distributed world-wide
within hot environments and had been completely overlooked. Two ss-rRNA
sequences from Uzon Caldeira (Kamchatka, Russia) and Yellowstone National
Park (USA) exhibited 83% sequence similarity to Nanoarchaeum equitans, and,
therefore, represent a distinct group within the Nanoarchaeota (Hohn et al.,
2002). Light microscopy and ﬂuorescence in situ staining reveal that these novel
Nanoarchaeota are again tiny cocci, approximately the size of Nanoarchaeum
equitans, however, attached to a rod-shaped Pyrobaculum-like host. The discovery
of the Nanoarchaeota suggests that further unrecognized major groups of microbes
may remain undetected by current PCR primers and are waiting for isolation to tell
us more about the origins and evolution of life.

Horizontal gene transfer, gene histories, and the
root of the tree of life

9.1 Introduction
Tracing organismal (species) histories on large evolutionary timescales remains
a big challenge in evolutionary biology. Darwin metaphorically labelled these
relationships the ‘tree of life’, but in his notebook he expressed unhappiness with
this label, because in the ‘tree of life’ depicting species evolution only the tips of
the branches are alive; this layer of living organisms rests on dead ancestors and
extinct relatives. Darwin mused that therefore the term ‘coral of life’ would be
more appropriate (B26 in Darwin (1987)); however, this alternative label did not
gain popularity. Different markers have been utilized to elucidate the relationship
among different lineages: from morphological characters to complete genomes.
Since complete genomes are now available for organisms from all three domains of
life, it is possible to use large amounts of data to attempt to decipher the relationships
between all known organisms.
Many comparative genome analyses have shown that different genes in genomes
often have different evolutionary histories (e.g., Hilario and Gogarten (1993),
Nesbo et al. (2001), and Zhaxybayeva et al. (2004)), which implies that the tree of
life metaphor (and a bifurcating tree as a model for evolutionary relationships in
general) might be no longer adequate (Doolittle, 1999). The incongruence between
gene histories can be attributed to many factors, one of which is horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). Simulations based on coalescence have shown that HGT can affect
not only the topology of an inferred phylogeny (and therefore inferences of last
common ancestors), but also divergence times (Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2004;
Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005). In this chapter we review challenges in multigene
analyses in light of HGT and discuss the consequences for inferring the position of
the root of the tree/coral of life.

9.2 How to analyse multigene data?
In addition to different models and methods for sequence analyses (see Chapter 8
for an overview), many methodologies exist for the analysis of multiple genes.
One approach is to combine individual genes into a single dataset to extract
phylogenetic information that might be distributed over many gene families; this
so-called ‘supermatrix approach’ is often cited as a way to improve the resolution
of the inferred phylogeny (Brown et al., 2001; Delsuc et al., 2005). In this
approach, the individual gene alignments are concatenated into one superalignment,
if the individual gene histories are found to have compatible (non-conﬂicting)
phylogenetic histories. Then the superalignment is analysed as if it were one gene
alignment, but with an advantage of containing a larger number of sites informative
for phylogenetic analysis.
A problem with direct concatenation is the selection of data to include. This
selection is complicated by the fact that the absence of evidence for transfer cannot
be taken as evidence for the absence of transfer. If one applies a stringent measure
for the detection of conﬂict, nearly all genes agree with each other within the limits
of conﬁdence. The amount of conﬂict detected depends on the chosen limits of
conﬁdence and on the extent of taxon sampling (Snel et al., 2002; Daubin et al.,
2003; Mirkin et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2005; Kunin et al., 2005).
Testing the compatibility between different trees and the alignments from
which these trees were derived using the Shimodaira–Hasegawa (Shimodaira and
Hasegawa, 1999) or approximately unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002) has
become the preferred tool for assessing potential conﬂict between individual gene
families (e.g., Lerat et al. (2003)). In these tests, the ﬁt of alternative topologies to
an alignment is evaluated and the trees under which the data have a signiﬁcantly
worse probability are rejected and considered as incompatible with the data. (The
probability of observing the data given a model of evolution and a phylogenetic tree
is also known as the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree.) However, the failure to reject
a tree should not be mistaken for evidence for congruence with a tree (Bapteste
et al., 2004). A gene might indeed have evolved with a different history, and this
history might be different from the consensus phylogeny, but the individual gene
family contains too little phylogenetically useful information to make the likelihood
of the two phylogenies signiﬁcantly different. This is analogous to the failure in
detecting a signiﬁcant correlation between fat intake and cancer (Prentice et al.,
2006): it does not prove that the correlation does not exist; it only says that the
correlation was not signiﬁcant in the dataset, possibly because too small a sample
was studied.
Another challenge to inferences based on concatenation may come from hidden,
or unrecognized, paralogy in lineages that went through frequent gene duplication

Horizontal gene transfer, gene histories, and the root of the tree of life

and aneupolyploidization (i.e., having multiple, albeit each incomplete, sets of
chromosomes). Especially in animals with metameric organization (i.e., with the
body divided into a number of similar segments), gene and genome duplications
have long been postulated to have created the regulatory complexity necessary
for the different bodyplans (e.g., Nam and Nei (2005)). Multiple whole genome
duplications were inferred for the early evolution of plants (Cui et al., 2006)
and vertebrates (Escriva et al., 2002; Meyer and Van de Peer, 2005). These gene
duplications have led to gene families with often astounding diversity (e.g., Foth
et al. (2006)).
However, it is not the complexity of the gene families in itself that generates
problems in phylogenetic reconstruction; rather, the frequent loss of one or the
other paralogue (Hughes and Friedman, 2004; Nam and Nei, 2005) can lead to
the inclusion of unrecognized paralogues in the datasets, with the result that some
of the events in the genes’ histories reﬂect gene duplication and not speciation
events. For example, analysing the homeobox gene superfamily in 11 genomes,
Nam and Nei (2005) inferred 88 homeobox genes to have been present in the
ancestor of bilateral animals. Thirty–forty of these were completely lost in one of
the 11 species analysed, and many of the ones still represented underwent frequent
gene duplications, especially in vertebrates, where more than 200 homeobox
genes are found per haploid genome. In a study of four animal genomes,
Hughes and Friedman (2004) observe massive (19–20% of gene families present
in common ancestor) parallel loss in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster.
An alternative to the supermatrix approaches (Delsuc et al., 2005) is to analyse
genes individually and to combine the resulting trees (or the bipartitions/embedded
quartets constituting the trees) into a consensus signal (i.e., the phylogenetic signal
supported by at least a plurality of genes) by using supertree methods (Beiko et al.,
2005), bipartition plotting (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2004), or quartet decomposition
(Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006). As an example, Figure 9.1A shows bipartition analysis
of 678 gene families present in ten cyanobacterial genomes (see Zhaxybayeva
et al. (2004) for more details). A bipartition plot shows all bipartitions signiﬁcantly
supported by at least one gene family and allows us to extract quickly the plurality
signal as well as gene families conﬂicting with it. Notably, for cyanobacteria,
only three compatible bipartitions are supported by the plurality of genes, resulting
in a not very resolved plurality consensus (Figure 9.1B). And even those three
bipartitions are conﬂicted strongly by 13 gene families (i.e., these genes support a
conﬂicting partition with >99% bootstrap support; see Figure 9.1 legend for the list
of gene families). An advantage of the bipartition plotting approach is that only the
signal retained in the plurality of datasets is used to synthesize the consensus; the

supporting each bipartition. The level of bootstrap support is coded by different
shades of gray. For details of phylogenetic analyses see Zhaxybayeva et al. (2004).

disadvantage is that individual gene analyses often suffer from a lack of resolution
due to an insufﬁcient number of phylogenetically informative positions.
Regardless of the method used to arrive at the consensus, the question still
remains: what does the signal inferred from multigene data mean? Does it serve
as a proxy for an organismal phylogeny? Does it sometimes reﬂect grouping by
ecotypes? In the next section we explore these questions by considering an example
of four marine cyanobacteria.

9.3 What does the plurality consensus represent? Example of small
marine cyanobacteria
At the time of the analysis, four genomes of small coccoid marine cyanobacteria
of broadly similar lifestyles had been completely sequenced: Prochlorococcus
marinus CCMP1375 (also known as SS120), Prochlorococcus marinus MED4,
Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, and marine Synechococcus WH8102.
Members of the Prochlorococcus genus have only been discovered quite recently
due to their small size and anomalously low ﬂuorescence (Chisholm et al., 1988).
Marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are proposed to diverge from a
common phycobilisome-containing ancestor (Ting et al., 2002). The phycobilisome
is a light-harvesting complex associated with photosystem II and is used as
a light-harvesting antenna in most cyanobacteria. Phylobilisomes, in contrast
to the light-harvesting complexes of higher plants, are not embedded in the
photosynthetic membrane, and they contain phycobilins as pigments, which give
the cyanobacteria their typical blue-green colour. While marine Synechococcus still
uses phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae (an ancestral trait), members of
the Prochlorococcus genus lack phycobilisomes and utilize a different chlorophylcontaining antenna complex (Pcb). Prochlorococcus also possess derivatives of
chlorophyll a and b pigments that are unique to this genus (see Partensky et al.
(1999) for a review). In addition, marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
are adapted to different ecological niches: marine Synechococcus is prevalent in
coastal waters, while Prochlorococcus is ubiquitous in open subtropical and tropical
ocean. Within Prochlorococcus marinus two ‘ecotypes’are differentiated: low-light
adapted and high-light adapted types (Rocap et al., 2003). In the 16S rRNA tree,
low-light adapted Prochlorococcus spp. form a paraphyletic clade with respect to
high-light adapted Prochlorococcus spp. (Ting et al., 2002). Beiko et al. (2005)
reported more than 250 HGT events among these marine cyanobacteria. In their
supertree as well as in our bipartition analyses (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2004) the
marine cyanobacteria cluster into two clades: P. marinus CCMP1375 (‘low-light’
adapted) groups with P. marinus MED4 (‘high-light’), and P. marinus MIT9313
(‘low-light’) groups with marine Synechococcus WH8102 (Beiko et al. (2005)
and Figure 9.1B). Interestingly, the relationship among these four genomes as
captured by the supertree and bipartition analyses does not support the relationship
inferred from phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA (e.g., Ting et al., 2002), or the
groupings based on proposed ecotypes (Ting et al., 2002; Rocap et al., 2003),
or the many derived characteristics shared between the three Prochlorococcus
species. These results are conﬁrmed through independent analyses of cyanobacteria
utilizing embedded quartets (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006). One explanation for the
conﬂict between the genome consensus, and the many complex derived characters

is rampant gene ﬂow among these genomes, such that the plurality consensus no
longer reﬂects the ecotype, physiology, and organismal history. In support of this
hypothesis, cyanophages infecting marine cyanobacteria have been reported to
contain genes important for photosynthesis (Mann et al., 2003; Lindell et al., 2004;
Millard et al., 2004; Sullivan et al., 2005; Zeidner et al., 2005), and likely mediate
transfer and recombination of these genes among the marine cyanobacteria (Zeidner
et al., 2005).
Notably, such an observation is not limited to prokaryotes. For example,
in incipient species of Darwin’s ﬁnches frequent introgression can make some
individuals characterized as belonging to the same species by morphology and
mating behaviour genetically more similar to a sister species (Grant et al., 2004).

9.4 Where is the root of the ‘tree of life’?
In phylogenetic analysis using molecular sequences external information is required
to identify the root of an inferred tree, i.e., the node from which all other nodes
of the tree are descended. Usually, an outgroup is needed to root a tree, i.e., a
taxon which is known to diverge earlier than the group of interest. However, this
methodology becomes inapplicable to the problem of rooting the tree of life (since
all organisms are part of the group of interest). One method of determining the
root of the tree of life from molecular data is to use ancient duplication events.
If a gene duplication event has occurred before the divergence of all extant
organisms, then the phylogenetic tree containing both gene duplicates will be
symmetrical, and one set of duplicated genes can be used as an outgroup to the
other. In the past, several pairs of anciently duplicated genes have been detected and
analysed. The analyses produced a variety of controversial results as summarized
in Table 9.1. A large-scale comparison of anciently duplicated genes did not bring
any consensus (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005), as possible locations of the root were
observed in various places (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005). If some groups of organisms
evolve slower than others in molecular and physiological characteristics, then their
phenotype might be considered as reﬂecting the phenotype of the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) (Woese, 1987; Xue et al., 2003; Ciccarelli et al., 2006).
However, these presumably primitive characteristics do not allow us to place the
ancestor in the tree of life, because they do not inform us about the relationship
between the slow and fast evolving groups (Cejchan, 2004).
Inspecting phylogenies based on molecular characters one often forgets that
the deeper parts of the tree of life are formed by only those lineages that have
extant representatives. However, these lineages were not the only ones present in
earlier times. Many lineages became extinct, or at least their extant representatives have not been discovered. It is reasonable to assume that at the time of the

organismal MRCA many other organisms were in existence as well (Figure 9.2). If
the processes of speciation and extinction can be approximated by a random process,
coalescence theory would be an appropriate tool to describe lineages through time
plots (Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2004).
Due to the vast time spans needed for the lineages to coalesce to their MRCA,
the individual phylogenies from extant lineages usually have two longest branches
leading to the MRCA, and therefore these phylogenetic analyses will be subject to
potential long branch attraction (LBA) artefacts. Therefore, additional higher order
shared derived characters (synapomorphies) are helpful to reinforce the inferred
position of the root. Larger insertions/deletions or derived structural features
are considered rare and mostly irreversible and may serve as synapomorphies
(e.g., see Gupta (2001) for the application of presumably unique insertions/deletions
to organismal classiﬁcation). For example, the domain architecture differences
between β and β  RNA polymerase subunits were used to polarize the tree of
bacterial RNA polymerases (Iyer et al., 2004). In another study, the position of the
root in the Glx-tRNA synthetase family tree was inferred from structural differences
in anticodon binding domains between GlnRS and GluRS (Siatecka et al., 1998).
Below we examine in detail the use of additional characters in supporting the
position of the root in the phylogenetic tree of ATPases.
9.5 Use of higher order characters: example of ATPases
The use of ATPase catalytic and non-catalytic subunits to root the tree of life was
originally introduced by Gogarten et al. (1989). This pair of anciently duplicated
genes places the root on the branch leading to Bacteria with high conﬁdence
(see Figure 9.3). Either the catalytic or the non-catalytic subunits can be considered

as the ingroup, and the outgroup is provided by the paralogous subunits. The
outgroup, a set of sequences rather divergent from the ingroup, joins the ingroup
on the longest internal branch. While this placement of the root is recovered
using different methods and evolutionary models (Gogarten et al., 1989; Iwabe
et al., 1989), it also coincides with the place where the root would be located
as the result of the LBA artefact (Philippe and Forterre, 1999; Gribaldo and
Philippe, 2002). However, in the case of the ATPases higher order characters
exclude placing the outgroup within the archaeal/eukaryotic ATPases subunits
(no higher order characters have been recognized for bacterial F-ATPases). The
archaeal vacuolar ATPase non-catalytic subunits have lost the canonical Walker
motif GxxGxGKT in their ATP binding pocket (Gogarten et al., 1989). This motif
is present in the orthologous F-ATPase non-catalytic subunits as well as in all of the
ancient paralogues, including the paralogous Rho transcription termination factors
(Richardson, 2002) and ATPases involved in assembly of the bacterial ﬂagella

(Vogler et al., 1991). Similarly, the catalytic subunits of the archaeal and of the
eukaryotic vacuolar typeATPase contain a faster evolving ‘non-homologous’region
that has no counterpart in the catalytic F-ATPase subunits, nor is this region found in
any of the non-catalytic subunits (Zimniak et al., 1988; Gogarten et al., 1989). The
absence of the canonical Walker motif in the regulatory subunits and the presence
of the non-homologous region in the catalytic subunits thus are shared derived
characters of the vacuolar and archaeal ATPases that preclude moving the root of
the ATPase phylogeny to a place within the clade constituted by the archaeal and
eukaryotic ATPases.

Horizontal gene transfer, gene histories, and the root of the tree of life

9.6 Conclusions
Consideration of gene transfer makes the analysis of species evolution among
prokaryotes similar to population genetics.As is the case for within species analyses,
gene trees for diverse groups of prokaryotes do not coalesce to the same ancestor,
and the organisms that carried the molecular ancestors often lived at different times.
For example, the human Y chromosome of all human males is traced back to an
MRCA (‘Adam’) who lived approximately 50 000 years ago (Thomson et al., 2000;
Underhill et al., 2000), while mitochondrial genes trace back to an MRCA (‘Eve’)
who lived about 166 000–249 000 years ago (Cann et al., 1987; Vigilant et al., 1991).
Many thousand years separate ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’ from each other. The analogy to
gene trees in recombining populations suggests that no single last common ancestor
contained all the genes ancestral to the ones shared between the three domains of
life. Each contemporary molecule traces back to an individual molecular MRCA,
but these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at
different times. Therefore, even with more accurate phylogenetic reconstruction
methods, one should not expect different molecular phylogenies to agree with one
another on the placement of the MRCA of all living organisms. Adaptation of
population genetics methodology may provide more fruitful results in studying
early evolutionary events.

CHAPTER	1

Foundations	of	the	Universe
	
The	more	the	universe	seems	comprehensible,	the	more	it	also	seems
pointless.
—STEVEN	WEINBERG,	The	First	Three	Minutes	(1993)

The	universe	was	not	pregnant	with	life	nor	the	biosphere	with	man.
—JACQUES	MONOD,	Chance	and	Necessity	(1971)

	
hese	 two	 great	 scientists,	 Weinberg	 the	 physicist,	 Nobel	 Prize
1979,	and	Monod	the	biologist,	Nobel	Prize	1965,	seem	to	speak	in
concert:	there	is	no	imperative	for	the	universe	to	exist,	nor	is	there
one	for	the	existence	of	life,	including	that	of	humans.	Weinberg	goes	on	to	say,	“But
if	there	is	no	solace	in	the	fruits	of	our	research,	there	is	at	least	some	consolation	in
the	 research	 itself,”	 and	 Monod,	 writing	 about	 the	 transcendence	 of	 ideas	 and
knowledge	over	ignorance,	announces,	“[Man’s]	destiny	is	nowhere	spelled	out,	nor	is
his	duty.	The	kingdom	above	or	the	darkness	below:	it	is	for	him	to	choose.”
These	two	men	lay	bare	the	stupefying	yet	exhilarating	recognition	that	there	is	no
design	 in	 the	 universe.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 there	 is	 a	 great	 sense	 of	 freedom	 and
responsibility	 that	 this	 thrusts	 upon	 us.	 There	 is	 a	 human	 imperative,	 but	 it	 does	 not
originate	 outside	 of	 us;	 we	 have	 created	 this	 imperative	 ourselves.	 We	 must	 now
complete	our	own	destiny:	our	self-imposed	search	for	the	origin	of	the	universe	and
that	 of	 life.	 These	 are	 the	 two	 deepest	 questions	 that	 science	 can	 ask	 and	 perhaps
answer.	Let	us	now	start	our	quest,	from	the	very	beginning,	and	study	the	foundation
upon	which	our	understanding	of	the	universe	is	built.
For	thousands	of	years	humans	have	gazed	at	the	night	sky,	the	Sun,	the	planets,
the	 surface	 of	 Earth,	 the	 plants	 and	 animals,	 and	 themselves.	 They	 have	 tried	 to
make	sense	of	what	they	saw	and	constructed	explanations	to	justify	the	existence	of
the	natural	world.	Most	of	these	explanations	have	not	passed	the	test	of	time.	Today

a	 set	 of	 interlocking	 scientific	 theories	 exists	 that	 provide	 tentative	 answers	 to	 the
origin	 of	 the	 universe	 and	 that	 of	 matter.	 These	 theories	 result	 from	 the	 melding	 of
relativity	 and	 quantum	 physics	 into	 cosmology.	 But	 to	 understand	 the	 current	 model
for	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 universe,	 one	 must	 first	 know	 what	 the	 universe	 contains	 and
understand	the	physical	theories	that	made	this	model,	the	Big	Bang,	possible.

WHAT	IS	IN	THE	UNIVERSE?
As	 Carl	 Sagan,	 the	 famous	 American	 astronomer	 and	 science
popularizer	once	suggested,	only	the	word	billions	 can	 give	 us	 any	 idea	 of	 what	 the
universe	is	all	about.	The	cosmos	is	very	large.	Some	wealthy	people	may	own	a	few
billion	dollars,	but	even	that	number,	as	high	as	it	may	seem,	is	nothing	in	comparison
to	the	number	of	stars	in	the	known	universe.	In	mathematical	notation,	1	billion	is	109,
1	followed	by	nine	zeros.	The	universe	contains	1011	(100	billion)	galaxies,	groups	of
stars,	and	each	galaxy	contains	on	average	1011	stars,	for	a	grand	total	of	1022	stars.
Therefore	 the	 estimated	 number	 of	 stars	 in	 the	 observable	 universe	 is	 1013	 times
bigger	 than	 the	 number	 of	 one-dollar	 bills	 in	 a	 billionaire’s	 wallet.	 This	 means	 that	 if
each	 dollar	 bill	 were	 equal	 to	 one	 single	 star,	 the	 cosmos	 would	 be	 10,000	 billion
times	richer	than	the	richest	tycoon.	This	number	has	to	humble	us.
The	 size	 of	 the	 observable	 universe	 is	 1023	 kilometers	 (the	 distance	 from	 Seattle
to	Miami	is	about	5	×	103	km),	while	its	age	is	12	to	15	billion	years.	In	our	corner	of
our	 galaxy,	 the	 Milky	 Way,	 interstellar	 distances	 are	 huge	 as	 well.	 Our	 nearest
neighbor	 star,	 Proxima	 Centauri,	 is	 5	 ×	 1013	 km	 away.	 Since	 it	 is	 impractical	 to	 use
numbers	 with	 such	 large	 exponents,	 astronomers	 use	 light-years	 to	 express
distances	in	the	universe.	In	those	units,	Proxima	Centauri	is	4	light-years	away	from
us.	In	other	words,	we	now	see	this	star	as	it	was	4	years	ago	because	it	took	that
long	for	its	light	to	reach	Earth.	To	get	a	better	idea	of	what	this	distance	means,	our
star,	 the	 Sun,	 is	 only	 8	 light-minutes	 away	 from	 Earth.	 The	 large	 neighboring	 galaxy
Andromeda	 is	 2	 million	 light-years	 away.	 It	 is	 so	 large,	 about	 as	 large	 as	 the	 Milky
Way,	 that	 it	 is	 visible	 with	 the	 naked	 eye	 in	 the	 constellation	 of	 the	 same	 name,
between	 Triangulum	 and	 Cassiopeia.	 By	 peering	 at	 the	 cosmos	 with	 our	 most
powerful	telescopes,	we	see	the	most	distant	galaxies	as	they	were	some	10	billion
years	 ago,	 since	 it	 took	 about	 10	 billion	 years	 for	 their	 light	 to	 reach	 Earth.	 This
means	 that	 we	 will	 observe	 them	 as	 they	 are	 today	 in	 10	 billion	 years	 from	 now,	 if
anyone	is	left	to	make	the	observation.
As	 we	 consider	 our	 solar	 system,	 numbers	 become	 less	 impressive.	 Only	 nine
planets	orbit	the	Sun	and	humans	have	sent	spacecraft	to	eight	of	them	(Pluto	has	yet
to	 be	 visited),	 with	 actual	 soft	 landings	 on	 two	 (Mars	 and	 Venus).	 We	 now	 believe
that	planets	are	probably	common	in	the	universe.	In	recent	years,	planets	have	been
discovered	 in	 several	 dozens	 of	 nearby	 star	 systems.	 These	 planets	 have	 not	 yet
been	 observed	 directly;	 rather,	 their	 presence	 has	 been	 inferred	 by	 measuring	 the
wobble	 that	 their	 gravitational	 pull	 exerts	 on	 their	 star	 or	 by	 measuring	 the	 drop	 in

their	star’s	brightness	as	they	transit	in	front	of	it	(literally	partially	eclipsing	it).	As	for
planets	that	harbor	life,	we	know	of	only	a	single	one.
Astronomers	and	cosmologists	have	calculated	an	age	for	the	universe,	about	12
to	15	billion	years.	This	date	of	course	implies	that	the	universe	had	a	beginning,	now
universally	known	as	the	Big	Bang.	Thus	the	universe	has	not	existed	for	an	eternity.
Before	 exploring	 how	 the	 universe	 got	 started,	 however,	 it	 would	 be	 good	 to	 have	 a
feel	for	what	12	to	15	billion	years	represent	on	a	scale	that	we	can	understand.	Carl
Sagan	 cleverly	 organized	 this	 time	 span	 into	 what	 he	 called	 the	 cosmic	 calendar.	 In
this	 calendar	 the	 age	 of	 the	 universe	 is	 compressed	 into	 one	 single	 year,	 starting
January	1	and	ending	December	31	at	midnight.	Here	is	an	excerpt	of	this	calendar:
	
January	1
Big	Bang
May	1
Formation	of	our	galaxy,	the	Milky	Way
September	9
Formation	of	the	solar	system
September	14
Formation	of	Earth
September	25
Origin	of	life	on	Earth
October	9
Oldest	known	bacterial	fossils	were	alive
November	12
First	complex	eukaryotic	cells	appeared
December	1
Earth’s	atmosphere	is	fully	oxygenated
December	16
First	worms
December	20
First	land	plants
December	22
First	amphibians
December	24
First	dinosaurs
December	29
First	primates
December	31
First	humans	(at	10:30	p.m.)
December	31
Domestication	of	fire	(at	11:46	p.m.)
December	31
Invention	of	the	alphabet	(at	11:59:51	p.m.)
December	31
Roman	Empire	(at	11:59:56	p.m.)
December	31
Renaissance	in	Europe	(at	11:59:59	p.m.)
During	the	last	second	of	the	year,	five	centuries
December	31
have	elapsed	and	humans	have	engaged	in	space
exploration.
	
It	is	interesting	to	note	that	in	the	cosmic	calendar,	it	took	several	months	for	our
Milky	 Way	 galaxy	 to	 form.	 We	 will	 see	 in	 chapter	 2	 what	 happened	 during	 these
“months.”	 Also,	 planet	 Earth	 formed	 nine	 and	 a	 half	 months	 into	 the	 year,	 but	 life
appeared	only	two	and	a	half	weeks	later.	This	is	lightning	fast	on	the	cosmic	scale.
We	will	see	in	chapters	4	and	5	what	may	have	happened	during	that	time.
As	 mentioned,	 the	 Big	 Bang	 model	 is	 rooted	 in	 theoretical	 physics	 and,	 in
particular,	in	the	convergence	of	relativity	and	quantum	mechanics.	Let	us	now	review

PHYSICS	HOLDS	ONE	OF	THE	CLUES	TO	THE	ORIGINS:
RELATIVITY
The	first	quarter	of	the	twentieth	century	witnessed	two	great	discoveries
in	physics.	In	chronological	order,	they	were	the	realization	that	mass	and	energy	are
equivalent	 and	 that	 matter	 can	 be	 understood	 both	 as	 waves	 and	 as	 particles.	 The
first	 discovery	 was	 made	 by	 Albert	 Einstein	 (a	 German,	 then	 Swiss,	 then	 American
citizen)	 as	 he	 was	 developing	 the	 theory	 of	 special	 relativity.	 The	 second	 discovery
was	 made	 by	 several	 scientists	 who	 founded	 quantum	 mechanics.	 This	 new	 view	 of
matter	and	energy	later	allowed	cosmologists	to	put	together	a	comprehensive	model
for	the	origin	of	matter	as	a	direct	consequence	of	the	creation	of	the	universe.
Albert	Einstein’s	famous	equation	E	=	mc2	(E	 is	 energy,	 m	 is	 mass,	 and	 c	 is	 the
speed	 of	 light)	 derives	 directly	 from	 his	 and	 others’	 requestioning	 of	 the	 laws	 of
motion	 that	 Galileo	 and	 Newton	 formulated	 centuries	 ago.	 This	 equation	 shows	 that
mass	is	a	form	of	energy.	It	was	Einstein	who	came	up	with	the	concept	of	mass	and
energy	 equivalence	 in	 his	 special	 relativity	 theory.	 The	 term	 relativity,	 as	 used	 here,
deals	 with	 the	 measurement	 of	 physical	 phenomena	 taking	 place	 in	 frames	 of
reference	whose	movements	are	relative	to	one	another,	at	constant	speeds.	Frame
of	reference	defines	any	location	in	space	characterized	by	a	set	of	coordinates	(up,
down,	left,	right,	front,	and	back),	while	a	physical	phenomenon	is	anything	that	can
be	 measured.	 For	 example,	 you	 could	 throw	 a	 ball	 forward	 (a	 measurable	 physical
phenomenon)	while	sitting	in	a	moving	bus	(one	frame	of	reference)	while	your	friend,
standing	 still	 on	 the	 sidewalk	 (a	 second	 frame	 of	 reference),	 is	 watching	 you.1	 For
you	 the	 ball	 simply	 moves	 forward	 at	 a	 certain	 speed,	 but	 for	 your	 friend	 it	 also
moves	together	with	the	bus.	For	her	the	ball	moves	faster	than	for	you	because	the
speed	 (or	 velocity)	 of	 the	 ball	 and	 the	 speed	 (or	 velocity)	 of	 the	 bus	 add	 up.	 If	 you
throw	the	ball	toward	the	back	of	the	moving	bus,	the	ball	moves	more	slowly	for	your
friend	 than	 for	 you	 because	 the	 velocity	 of	 the	 ball	 must	 be	 subtracted	 from	 that	 of
the	bus.	This	is	what	Galileo	and	Newton	had	already	described	and	understood.
Einstein,	 however,	 took	 the	 position	 that	 light	 behaves	 differently	 from	 anything
else	that	moves.	For	him	the	speed	of	light	is	the	same	in	all	nonaccelerating	(that	is,
moving	at	constant	velocities)	frames	of	reference.	In	that	view,	no	matter	how	fast	a
frame	of	reference	is	moving,	the	speed	of	light	cannot	be	exceeded.	For	example,	if
you	 flash	 a	 laser	 pointer	 toward	 the	 front	 of	 a	 moving	 bus,	 that	 light,	 for	 your
motionless	 friend	 on	 the	 sidewalk,	 will	 not	 move	 at	 its	 own	 speed	 (about	 300,000
km/sec)	plus	that	of	the	bus.	For	both	you	and	your	friend,	light	will	move	at	exactly
the	 same	 speed,	 about	 300,000	 km/sec.	 The	 same	 concept	 applies	 to	 a	 laser
pointing	 toward	 the	 back	 of	 the	 bus.	 Again,	 for	 both	 you	 and	 your	 friend,	 light	 will
move	at	the	same	speed,	not	more	slowly	for	her,	regardless	of	the	speed	of	the	bus.

The	constancy	of	the	speed	of	light	has	dramatic	consequences	for	physics,	as	I	will
next	explain.
In	 classical	 (Newtonian)	 mechanics,	 by	 definition,	 a	 constant	 force	 acting	 on	 an
object	 for	 an	 infinite	 period	 of	 time	 will	 impart	 on	 the	 object	 an	 infinite	 velocity.	 For
example,	 an	 infinitely	 large	 fuel	 tank	 feeding	 a	 rocket	 engine	 burning	 for	 an	 infinite
time	 would	 make	 a	 rocket	 go	 infinitely	 fast.	 Not	 so	 in	 relativistic	 mechanics;	 here	 an
infinite	 velocity	 is	 impossible	 because	 nothing	 can	 go	 faster	 than	 light.	 Even	 at	 an
infinite	 time,	 during	 which	 acceleration	 is	 occurring,	 the	 object	 will	 simply	 get	 closer
and	 closer	 to	 the	 speed	 of	 light	 but	 will	 never	 reach	 it	 and	 certainly	 not	 exceed	 it
(figure	1.1).	This	principle	is	not	just	a	figment	of	Einstein’s	imagination	but	has	been
verified	experimentally	many	times.	The	speed	of	light	in	a	vacuum	is	indeed	constant,
regardless	of	the	velocities	of	reference	frames.	(It	is,	however,	not	the	same	in	say,
air	and	glass,	but	the	principle	of	relativity	applies	under	all	conditions.)

FIGURE	1.1	A	graph	of	velocity	versus	time,	representing	acceleration,	in	Newtonian	mechanics	and	in
relativistic	 mechanics.	 Relativistic	 and	 Newtonian	 mechanics	 predict	 the	 same	 values	 for	 acceleration	 at	 low
velocities.	At	high	velocities,	relativistic	mechanics	predicts	smaller	and	smaller	values	for	acceleration,	contrary	to
Newtonian	mechanics.

Next,	Einstein	realized	that	time	and	space	are	intimately	linked	and	that	time	is	a
fourth	 coordinate,	 adding	 to	 the	 familiar	 three	 dimensions	 of	 regular	 space.	 Thus	 in
relativity,	 one	 speaks	 of	 space-time.	 We	 know	 that	 moving	 objects	 move	 because
over	time	we	do	not	see	them	exactly	in	the	same	position	as	before.	But	the	speed
of	light	is	an	intrinsic	part	of	this	process	because	our	measurements	imply	that	light

moves	 from	 the	 objects	 to	 our	 eyes.	 Thus	 space-time	 becomes	 a	 relative	 quantity
(just	as	positioning	in	space	alone	is)	that	differs	in	different	frames	of	reference.	This
complicated	 reasoning	 led	 to	 the	 seemingly	 absurd	 conclusion	 of	 time	 dilation.
According	 to	 Einstein’s	 calculations,	 a	 clock	 (the	 time-measuring	 device)	 in	 a	 moving
frame	of	reference	runs	slower	than	a	clock	inside	a	motionless	frame	of	reference.
And	this	is	exactly	what	happens!	Time	dilation	has	been	measured	by	very	accurate
atomic	 clocks	 installed	 aboard	 artificial	 satellites	 and	 fast-moving	 airplanes.	 This
effect	is	normally	observable	only	at	very	high	speeds	because	the	equations	contain
a	divisor	proportional	to	the	square	of	the	speed	of	light,	a	very	large	quantity.	Thus
our	 everyday	 experiences	 preclude	 us	 from	 feeling	 time	 dilation	 because	 most	 of	 us
do	 not	 move	 at	 speeds	 that	 exceed	 about	 0.3	 km/sec	 (about	 the	 speed	 of	 a	 jet),
whereas	the	speed	of	light	is	1	million	times	faster	(see	appendix	1).
Now,	 since	 space-time	 is	 relative	 (as	 time	 measurements	 show),	 what	 about
mass?	 In	 Newtonian	 mechanics,	 mass	 is	 a	 constant	 that	 does	 not	 depend	 on	 the
speed	 of	 the	 object	 possessing	 the	 mass.	 Going	 back	 to	 figure	 1.1,	 we	 see	 that	 in
relativistic	 mechanics,	 a	 constant	 force	 applied	 over	 time	 to	 an	 object	 will	 result	 in
smaller	 and	 smaller	 velocity	 increments	 experienced	 by	 the	 object.	 Close	 to	 the
speed	 of	 light,	 these	 increments	 become	 infinitely	 small.	 In	 Newtonian	 mechanics	 a
body’s	 rate	 of	 change	 of	 velocity	 with	 time	 remains	 constant,	 which	 means	 that
acceleration	 remains	 constant	 over	 time.	 However,	 in	 relativistic	 mechanics	 the
velocity	 rate	 of	 change,	 the	 acceleration	 of	 a	 body,	 decreases	 with	 time	 and	 tends
toward	zero	at	infinite	time.	The	body	is	thus	seen	as	resisting	acceleration.
The	ability	of	an	object	to	resist	velocity	changes	is	called	inertia.	Mass,	however,
is	a	measure	of	inertia.	For	example,	a	massive	rock	requires	a	larger	effort	to	move
than	 a	 small	 rock	 because	 its	 inertia,	 its	 mass,	 is	 greater.	 Thus	 in	 special	 relativity,
the	mass	of	an	object	increases	as	its	velocity	increases,	and	it	tends	toward	infinity
as	 velocity	 approaches	 the	 speed	 of	 light,	 therefore	 precluding	 any	 object	 from
reaching	 that	 speed!	 The	 speed	 of	 light	 cannot	 be	 reached	 because	 at	 that	 speed,
the	mass	of	the	object	would	be	infinite	and	the	force	needed	to	continue	to	move	it
also	 infinite.	 In	 special	 relativity	 the	 mass	 of	 an	 object	 is	 represented	 by	
,	 where	 m0	 is	 the	 rest	 mass	 (the	 mass	 of	 the	 object
when	it	is	not	moving),	v	is	the	object’s	velocity,	and	c	is	the	speed	of	light.	As	can	be
seen,	 the	 quantity	 v2/c2	 appears	 in	 the	 equation,	 meaning	 that	 relativistic	 effects	 are
negligible	at	low	velocity	but	become	important	as	v	approaches	c.	Also,	the	equation
shows	that	if	v	=	c,	the	divisor	equals	zero	and	thus	m	is	infinite.
Again,	 this	 is	 not	 just	 the	 result	 of	 some	 complicated	 mathematical	 tricks.
Subatomic	 particles	 such	 as	 protons	 and	 electrons	 have	 been	 accelerated	 in	 “atom
smashers”	 (particle	 accelerators)	 so	 that	 they	 move	 at	 a	 rate	 close	 to	 the	 speed	 of
light.	 As	 their	 velocity	 increases,	 it	 becomes	 more	 and	 more	 difficult	 to	 give	 them
additional	 velocity	 because	 their	 mass	 increases,	 just	 as	 the	 equations	 predict,
increasing	 the	 additional	 force	 needed	 to	 accelerate	 them.	 For	 example,	 in	 a
synchrotron	 used	 to	 accelerate	 electrons,	 the	 magnetic	 field	 needed	 to	 deflect

electrons	moving	close	to	the	speed	of	light	is	2000	times	greater	than	that	predicted
by	 Newton’s	 theory.	 This	 is	 because	 at	 these	 relativistic	 speeds,	 the	 electrons	 are
2000	 times	 more	 massive	 than	 when	 at	 rest,	 as	 predicted	 by	 the	 special	 theory	 of
relativity	(see	appendix	1).
What	has	this	got	to	do	with	the	equivalence	between	mass	and	energy?	Newton
had	 demonstrated	 that	 the	 energy	 of	 a	 body	 by	 virtue	 of	 its	 velocity	 is	
,
where	m	is	the	mass	and	v	is	its	velocity.	Remember	that	Newton	regarded	mass	as
a	constant.	For	Einstein,	as	we	have	seen,	mass	is	not	a	constant,	since	it	increases
with	velocity.	Thus	the	energy	E	does	not	simply	increase	with	v2,	it	also	increases	as
mass	 (m)	 increases	 with	 v.	 Thus	 mass	 should	 be	 considered	 a	 form	 of	 energy.	 But
Einstein	 went	 further	 and	 made	 the	 bold	 assumption	 that	 the	 rest	 mass	 of	 an	 object
(its	 mass	 regardless	 of	 its	 velocity,	 as	 low	 as	 it	 might	 be)	 is	 also	 a	 form	 of	 energy.
Einstein	 was	 of	 course	 proven	 right	 with	 the	 detonation	 of	 the	 first	 atom	 bomb	 in
1945,	 which	 demonstrated	 the	 conversion	 of	 a	 plutonium	 mass	 into	 heat	 (a	 form	 of
energy),	electromagnetic	energy	(gamma	rays),	and	nuclear	fragments.
More	 interestingly,	 Einstein’s	 theory	 also	 predicted	 that	 energy	 in	 the	 form	 of
radiation	 could	 materialize,	 provided	 that	 radiation	 packed	 enough	 energy.	 That	 is,
special	 relativity	 predicted	 that	 matter	 could	 appear	 from	 radiation,	 which	 is	 the
reverse	 of	 what	 happens	 when	 a	 nuclear	 warhead	 is	 detonated.	 This	 was
demonstrated	 when	 energetic	 gamma	 rays	 were	 observed	 to	 materialize	 into
electron-antielectron	 pairs	 (that	 is,	 matter	 and	 antimatter).	 Thus	 it	 can	 also	 be	 said
that	energy	is	just	another	form	of	matter.	Thus	E	=	mc2,	or	m	=	E/c2.	Mathematically
this	is	trivial,	but	conceptually	it	is	not.	In	particular,	this	means	that	energetic	photons
(electromagnetic	 radiation	 of	 zero	 rest	 mass)	 of	 high	 energy	 E	 and	 moving	 at	 the
speed	of	light,	as	all	photons	do	by	definition,	can	be	converted	into	material	mass.	In
that	 sense,	 matter	 can	 appear	 from	 nonmatter.	 This	 mass-energy	 equivalence	 has
important	 consequences	 for	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 universe,	 as	 we	 will	 see	 in	 the	 next
chapter.
About	10	years	after	he	formulated	his	special	relativity	theory,	Einstein	published
his	 general	 theory,	 in	 which	 reference	 frames	 were	 no	 longer	 assumed	 to	 be	 in
steady	 motion	 relative	 to	 one	 another;	 they	 could	 also	 experience	 acceleration.
Newton	had	already	demonstrated	that	acceleration	is	involved	in	gravitational	effects
such	as	those	experienced	by	planets	orbiting	a	star.	The	general	theory	of	relativity
is	then	a	theory	of	gravity.	This	theory	involves	mathematics	much	more	sophisticated
than	 that	 used	 for	 the	 special	 theory	 (which	 involves	 only	 high	 school	 math—at	 least
as	 taught	 in	 a	 good	 high	 school).	 There	 Einstein	 demonstrated	 the	 equivalence
between	gravity	and	the	warping	of	space.	In	other	words,	gravity	was	no	longer	the
property	of	massive	bodies	per	se;	these	bodies	(such	as	stars)	deformed	the	fabric
of	 space-time	 and	 led	 to	 the	 formation	 of	 gravity	 “wells”	 in	 which	 satellites	 such	 as
planets	 would	 “fall”	 and	 orbit.	 Similarly,	 starlight	 would	 be	 deflected	 by	 the	 gravity
wells	of	other	stars	(figure	1.2).	This	conclusion	was	quickly	verified.	Massive	objects
like	 stars	 are	 indeed	 able	 to	 deform	 the	 straight	 path	 of	 light	 emanating	 from	 other
stars	because	they	warp	space.	General	relativity	thus	seemed	like	a	good	theory	to

describe	 the	 universe,	 which	 is	 of	 course	 a	 vast	 space	 full	 of	 massive	 bodies	 (the
stars	and	galaxies)	possessing	impressive	gravitational	fields.

FIGURE	1.2	How	starlight	is	deflected	by	the	gravitational	well	of	the	Sun.	A	photo	of	a	star	whose	light
path	 grazes	 the	 Sun	 was	 taken	 during	 a	 total	 solar	 eclipse,	 which	 allowed	 this	 star	 to	 be	 visible	 during	 daytime.
Another	photograph,	taken	at	night	without	the	Sun	in	the	line	of	sight,	showed	the	shift	in	the	star’s	position	caused
by	the	Sun’s	deflection	of	its	light.	The	reference	star	is	far	away	from	the	sun	and	its	light	is	not	deflected	by	the
Sun’s	 gravitational	 well.	 The	 angular	 distance	 between	 the	 true	 and	 apparent	 positions	 is	 greatly	 exaggerated	 for
clarity.	 The	 actually	 measured	 angular	 shift	 is	 only	 about	 1	 second	 of	 arc,	 in	 full	 agreement	 with	 Einstein’s
calculations.

Einstein	 and	 Willem	 de	 Sitter	 (a	 Dutch	 physicist	 and	 a	 contemporary	 of	 Einstein)
applied	the	equations	of	Einstein’s	general	theory	to	the	universe	as	a	whole,	and	the
result	had	one	important	consequence:	this	universe	cannot	be	stable;	it	must	expand.
Newton	 had	 already	 identified	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 stability	 of	 the	 universe.	 In	 his
model,	the	universe	could	not	be	stable	either,	because	the	masses	of	the	stars	and
their	gravitational	attraction	would	cause	an	inevitable	collapse,	given	enough	time.	In
the	Einstein-de	Sitter	universe,	on	the	other	hand,	expansion	was	predicted.	In	1916,
when	 Einstein’s	 theory	 was	 published,	 there	 was	 no	 evidence	 whatsoever	 that	 the
universe	 was	 contracting	 or	 expanding.	 Yet	 his	 general	 relativity	 theory	 offered	 the
possibility	that	at	one	time,	the	universe’s	size	could	have	been	exactly	zero—in	other
words,	 a	 singularity	 in	 space-time	 with	 infinite	 energy	 (remember	 the	 mass,	 that	 is,

matter-energy	 equivalence).	 Einstein	 himself	 dismissed	 this	 possibility,	 since	 there
was	no	experimental	evidence	to	prove	(or	disprove)	expansion	or	contraction	at	the
time	he	published	his	work.
Now,	 Einstein’s	 insight	 and	 rigorous	 mathematical	 development	 was	 proven	 right
when,	 in	 1919,	 astronomers	 demonstrated	 that	 starlight	 can	 indeed	 be	 deflected	 by
massive	objects	such	as	stars.	Was	there	something	wrong	with	general	relativity	as
it	pertained	to	the	whole	universe,	as	opposed	to	just	individual	stars	or	galaxies?	No,
we	 know	 today	 that	 Einstein’s	 general	 relativity	 is	 more	 complete	 and	 verified	 than
any	 other	 theory	 (except	 quantum	 mechanics,	 not	 a	 competing	 theory)	 ever
formulated.	 Einstein’s	 interpretations	 were	 not	 just	 the	 ramblings	 of	 an	 ivory	 tower
dweller,	 they	 were	 real.	 Therefore	 the	 whole	 theory,	 including	 an	 expansion	 of	 the
universe,	must	have	great	validity.	The	question	was,	then,	is	space	really	expanding?
Careful	 observation	 of	 the	 movement	 of	 galaxies	 in	 the	 cosmos	 provided	 the
answer	 and,	 in	 a	 nutshell,	 this	 answer	 is	 that	 space	 is	 indeed	 expanding.	 The
expansion	of	the	universe	was	put	on	firm	footing	by	several	astronomers	working	in
the	 mid	 to	 late	 1920s.	 For	 this,	 these	 astronomers	 decomposed	 the	 light	 of	 distant
galaxies	 by	 using	 prisms	 or	 similar	 devices.	 When	 starlight	 is	 decomposed	 by	 a
prism,	we	observe	the	fundamental	colors	that	combine	to	give	white	light	(in	the	case
of	 the	 Sun),	 and	 a	 series	 of	 dark	 lines.	 These	 dark	 lines	 are	 called	 an	 absorption
spectrum;	 they	 result	 from	 the	 absorption	 of	 specific	 wavelengths	 by	 elements
present	in	the	Sun	and	other	stars	(figure	1.3A).	This	is	how	helium	was	discovered	in
the	nineteenth	century,	by	noting	that	some	absorption	lines	in	the	Sun’s	spectrum	did
not	 correspond	 to	 any	 element	 known	 so	 far	 on	 Earth	 but	 were	 distinguishable	 in
sunlight.
Galaxies	are	composed	of	many	billions	of	stars,	so	the	absorption	spectrum	of	a
galaxy	 gives	 an	 indication	 of	 what	 elements	 predominate	 in	 the	 stars	 present	 in	 that
galaxy.	One	element	whose	absorption	lines	are	particularly	convenient	to	observe	is
calcium.	 Astronomers	 made	 an	 astonishing	 discovery:	 the	 far	 ther	 away	 the	 galaxy,
the	 more	 the	 calcium	 lines	 are	 shifted	 to	 red	 wavelengths.	 When	 stationary	 (as	 in	 a
laboratory	 situation),	 calcium’s	 prominent	 spectral	 lines	 are	 in	 the	 blue	 region	 of	 the
spectrum.	 However,	 these	 calcium	 lines	 shift	 to	 the	 center	 of	 the	 spectrum,	 in	 the
yellow-green	 region,	 for	 galaxies	 not	 too	 far	 away,	 and	 to	 the	 red	 region	 of	 the
spectrum	for	very	distant	galaxies	(figure	1.3B).

galaxies?	 This	 redshift	 can	 be	 understood	 in	 terms	 of	 what	 is	 called	 the	 Doppler
effect.	This	effect	is	familiar	to	all	of	us.	When	an	ambulance	is	using	its	siren	(or	bell,
or	other	sound	device),	the	pitch	of	the	siren	increases	as	the	ambulance	approaches
us,	then	decreases	as	the	ambulance	moves	away.	This	is	because	the	sound	waves
of	 a	 moving	 object	 increase	 in	 frequency	 as	 the	 object	 is	 approaching	 but	 decrease
as	 the	 object	 is	 receding.	 The	 same	 happens	 with	 light	 waves:	 when	 a	 luminous
object	approaches	us,	the	frequency	of	the	light	it	emits	is	shorter	(blue-shifted)	than
that	 of	 the	 same	 stationary	 object	 (figure	 1.4).	 Conversely,	 when	 the	 object	 moves
away	 from	 us,	 its	 light	 is	 red-shifted.	 What	 is	 more,	 the	 amount	 of	 blueshifting	 or
redshifting	is	proportional	to	the	velocity	of	the	object.	(However,	do	not	expect	to	see
blue-shifted	 or	 red-shifted	 car	 lights;	 cars	 move	 much	 too	 slowly	 for	 the	 Doppler
effect	to	be	noticeable	with	light.)
Applying	 the	 Doppler	 effect	 to	 the	 shifting	 of	 calcium	 lines	 (and	 other	 elements’
lines)	in	the	spectra	of	galaxies,	astronomers	were	left	with	only	one	conclusion:	the
spectral	 lines	 of	 galaxies	 are	 red-shifted	 because	 the	 galaxies	 are	 receding	 from	 us
at	high	speed,	and	their	wavelength	is	increased	relative	to	stationary	spectra.	What
is	more,	they	discovered	that	the	more	distant	a	galaxy	is,	the	faster	it	recedes.2	For
example,	the	Virgo	cluster	galaxy,	which	is	78	million	light-years	from	us,	recedes	at
1200	km/sec.	On	the	other	hand,	the	Hydra	cluster,	which	is	4	billion	light-years	away,
recedes	 at	 61,000	 km/sec.	 Therefore	 Einstein’s	 prediction	 of	 an	 expanding	 universe
now	 had	 an	 observational	 foundation:	 since	 galaxies	 recede	 from	 one	 another,	 the
size	of	the	universe	is	growing	with	time;	it	is	expanding.	This	expansion	should	not	be
misunderstood:	the	universe	is	not	expanding	into	something	such	as	a	big	void;	it	is
space	itself	that	is	expanding.	This	effect	actually	“stretches”	the	wavelength	of	light,
making	it	redder	because	red	light	has	a	longer	wavelength	than	blue	light.
The	expansion	concept	immediately	suggests	that	the	universe	had	a	beginning.	If,
indeed,	we	ran	the	clock	back	and	looked	at	the	universe	earlier	and	earlier	in	time,
the	 galaxies	 would	 be	 seen	 to	 approach	 one	 another,	 make	 contact,	 and	 eventually
perhaps	 merge	 into	 a	 Big	 Crunch.	 As	 this	 crunch	 progressed,	 we	 would	 witness	 an
enormous	increase	in	density,	as	all	the	matter	in	the	universe	would	be	concentrated
into	a	smaller	and	smaller	volume.	Could	the	end	of	this	process	be	the	zero-volume
singularity	mentioned	earlier	in	this	chapter?	Could	all	these	billions	and	billions	of	tons
of	 galactic	 matter	 concentrate	 into	 a	 very	 small	 volume?	 Before	 addressing	 this
question,	 we	 must	 first	 understand	 what	 matter	 is	 and	 how	 matter	 and	 radiation
interact.

The	macroscopic	world	in	which	we	live	is	deterministic.	When	we	see	a
moving	car	on	the	road,	we	expect	to	be	able	to	precisely	determine	its	location	and
speed.	 This	 is	 how	 the	 police	 deliver	 speeding	 tickets.	 Not	 so	 in	 the	 world	 of	 the
atom,	 where	 indeterminacy	 is	 the	 norm.	 Also,	 a	 solid	 object	 such	 as	 a	 brick	 is
obviously	composed	of	material	elements,	not	electromagnetic	radiation	such	as	light,
which	 we	 normally	 characterize	 by	 its	 wavelength	 or	 its	 color.	 Again,	 not	 so	 in	 the
atomic	and	subatomic	world,	even	that	making	up	the	brick.	We	will	indeed	see	later
that	 particles	 of	 matter	 can	 also	 be	 characterized	 as	 waves.	 The	 branch	 of	 physics
studying	phenomena	at	the	level	of	the	atom	and	below	is	called	quantum	mechanics,
the	field	that	has	generated	quantum	indeterminacy	and	matter	waves.
Quantum	mechanics	was	developed	in	the	middle	and	late	1920s	but	had	its	origin
at	the	turn	of	the	twentieth	century.	Einstein,	together	with	Max	Planck	(of	Germany),
Louis	 de	 Broglie	 (of	 France),	 and	 Niels	 Bohr	 (of	 Denmark),	 all	 Nobel	 laureates,
founded	 this	 new	 science.	 However,	 a	 second	 generation	 of	 researchers,	 Max	 Born
and	 Werner	 Heisenberg	 (both	 Germans),	 Erwin	 Schrödinger	 and	 Wolfgang	 Pauli
(both	 Austrians),	 and	 Paul	 Dirac	 (an	 Englishman),	 also	 all	 Nobel	 laureates,	 gave
quantum	 mechanics	 its	 present	 face,	 one	 that	 some	 call	 quantum	 weirdness.	 This	 is
because	 quantum	 mechanics	 defies	 our	 common	 sense;	 it	 is	 completely
counterintuitive.	 Nevertheless,	 quantum	 mechanics	 and	 its	 derivatives,	 quantum
electrodynamics	and	quantum	chromodynamics,	are	exquisitely	precise	in	measuring,
interpreting,	and	predicting	the	behavior	of	atomic	and	subatomic	particles.
Quantum	 mechanics	 and	 relativity	 theory	 are	 the	 two	 pillars	 of	 modern	 physics.
These	are	two	theories	that	simply	work	extremely	well	to	explain	the	physical	world.
Modern	 cosmology,	 the	 study	 of	 the	 universe	 on	 a	 grand	 scale,	 uses	 both	 relativity
(which	deals	with	universe-size	objects)	and	quantum	mechanics	(which	deals	with	the
inframicroscopic	world)	because,	as	one	could	surmise,	the	properties	of	matter	and
radiation	must	have	an	effect	on	the	universe,	which	contains	both.
The	 birth	 of	 quantum	 mechanics	 occurred	 in	 1899,	 when	 Max	 Planck
demonstrated	 that	 light	 energy	 was	 not	 exchanged	 with	 matter	 in	 a	 smooth
continuum,	 as	 had	 been	 thought	 until	 then.	 By	 smooth	 continuum,	 I	 mean	 a
mechanism	 that	 does	 not	 operate	 by	 jerks.	 For	 example,	 when	 I	 depress	 the
accelerator	pedal	of	my	car,	I	admit	more	fuel	into	the	cylinders,	where	it	burns.	That
chemical	energy	is	turned	into	kinetic	energy	at	the	level	of	the	pistons,	which	in	turn
operate	 the	 axle	 and	 finally	 the	 wheels.	 This	 chemical	 energy	 and	 the	 kinetic	 energy
are	 not	 produced	 by	 leaps	 and	 bounds;	 smoothly	 depressing	 the	 accelerator	 results
in	a	smooth	acceleration.3
In	 Planck’s	 day	 this	 was	 what	 everybody	 in	 the	 world	 of	 physics	 assumed	 to	 be
true:	 light,	 a	 form	 of	 electromagnetic	 energy,	 and	 matter	 interacted	 in	 a	 perfectly
linear	way,	not	in	a	stepwise	fashion.	But	there	was	then	the	nagging	problem	of	the
blackbody	 radiation.	 A	 blackbody	 in	 physics	 is	 a	 hollow,	 material	 object	 able	 to
absorb	and	reemit,	as	electromagnetic	radiation,	the	thermal	energy	it	has	received.
Thus	a	blackbody	heated	at	high	enough	temperature	can	turn	red	hot,	then	white	hot,
much	 like	 a	 piece	 of	 iron.	 The	 blackbody	 then	 emits	 visible	 light	 that	 the	 human	 eye

can	 perceive.	 If	 heated	 at	 a	 higher	 temperature,	 the	 blackbody	 starts	 emitting	 even
shorter-wavelength	light—namely,	ultraviolet	(UV)	light.
It	turns	out	that	the	theoretical	equations	used	in	the	nineteenth	century	to	model
the	 behavior	 of	 a	 blackbody	 as	 a	 function	 of	 temperature	 were	 hopelessly	 flawed.
These	 equations	 predicted	 that	 at	 high	 temperature,	 the	 blackbody	 would	 emit	 an
infinite	 amount	 of	 UV	 radiation.	 This	 was	 not	 experimentally	 observed.	 In	 fact,	 the
amount	of	UV	radiation	was	observed	to	drop	off,	not	increase	to	infinity.	Clearly,	the
theory	 did	 not	 match	 observations,	 a	 damning	 fact	 for	 a	 theory.	 Planck	 set	 out	 to
derive	an	equation	that	matched	experimental	observations,	and	he	succeeded	in	his
efforts.	 To	 his	 own	 surprise,	 he	 discovered	 that	 his	 new	 equation	 implied	 that
electromagnetic	 energy	 could	 not	 be	 emitted	 by	 the	 blackbody	 in	 a	 continuous,
smooth	fashion.	Rather,	his	equation	predicted	that	the	energy	came	in	discrete,	finite
packets	 or	 bundles,	 which	 he	 called	 quanta.	 Therefore	 energy	 emission	 of	 the
blackbody	 was	 not	 unlike	 the	 steps	 of	 a	 staircase:	 there	 is	 no	 such	 thing	 as	 half,	 a
quarter,	or	an	eighth	of	a	step.	Like	steps	of	a	staircase,	quanta	came	in	full	units	of
themselves	and	this	meant	that	energy	could	not	be	emitted	on	a	smooth,	continuous
scale	 divided	 into	 infinitely	 small	 increments.	 Energy	 in	 the	 form	 of	 electromagnetic
radiation	was	received	and	emitted	in	jerks—that	is,	in	discrete	amounts.
Planck’s	 work	 was	 entirely	 theoretical,	 but	 Einstein	 demonstrated	 in	 1905	 that
quanta	can	explain	very	real	experimental	observations.	To	do	this,	Einstein	solved	the
mystery	of	the	photoelectric	effect.	Some	metals,	such	as	sodium,	release	electrons
when	 they	 are	 irradiated	 with	 light.	 This	 is	 the	 photoelectric	 effect.	 The	 released
electrons,	when	forced	to	move	by	an	electric	field	such	as	that	imposed	by	a	battery,
produce	 a	 current.	 This	 principle	 is	 at	 work	 in	 elevator	 doors	 that	 reopen	 as	 an
entering	passenger	is	on	the	verge	of	being	crushed.
Before	 Einstein	 it	 was	 known	 that	 the	 intensity	 of	 a	 current	 (the	 number	 of
electrons	released	by	the	metal	surface)	was	determined	by	the	intensity	of	the	light
reaching	 the	 metal.	 However,	 and	 this	 is	 what	 puzzled	 everybody,	 the	 wavelength	 of
the	 light	 had	 to	 be	 just	 right.	 If	 the	 photocell	 responded	 to	 blue	 light,	 it	 would	 not
respond	to	red	light,	no	matter	how	intense	the	red	light	was.	Red	light	simply	refused
to	 release	 electrons	 from	 the	 metal	 surface	 and	 nobody	 understood	 why.	 Enter
Einstein.	Although	it	was	contrary	to	what	the	scientific	community	had	held	for	many
years,	 Einstein	 assumed	 that	 light,	 which	 was	 evidently	 a	 wavelike	 phenomenon,
could	 also	 act	 like	 particles	 or	 packets	 of	 energy.	 And	 it	 worked!	 Einstein’s	 energy
packets,	now	called	photons,	were	Planck’s	quanta.
This	 is	 how,	 according	 to	 Einstein,	 the	 photoelectric	 effect	 works.	 Electrons	 are
bound	to	the	atoms	composing	the	surface	of	the	light-sensitive	metal.	If	the	photons
of	 light	 that	 hit	 the	 metal	 surface	 carry	 an	 energy	 less	 than	 that	 of	 the	 electrons’
binding	 energy,	 no	 electrons	 will	 be	 released.	 If,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 the	 photons	 carry
enough	energy,	electrons	will	be	knocked	off	the	metal	surface	and	freed.	Since	the
energy	 of	 a	 photon	 is	 directly	 proportional	 to	 the	 frequency	 of	 the	 light	 in	 question
(through	 E	 =	 hf,	 where	 f	 is	 the	 frequency	 and	 h	 is	 a	 constant	 called	 the	 Planck
constant),	this	explains	why	low-frequency	light	(red	light,	for	example)	cannot	extract

electrons	from	the	surface,	whereas	higher-frequency	light	(such	as	blue	light)	can	do
the	job	(figure	1.5).	Simply	put,	in	this	example,	the	photons	of	red	light	do	not	pack
enough	energy	to	free	electrons,	whereas	photons	of	blue	light	do.	Einstein’s	quantum
interpretation	 of	 light	 was	 fully	 verified	 experimentally	 in	 1914	 and	 he	 received	 the
1921	Nobel	Prize	for	physics	for	this	discovery.
Now	this	quantum	theory	posed	a	problem:	is	light	an	electromagnetic	wave	or	is
it	made	of	particles?	An	electromagnetic	wave	is	a	combination	of	coupled,	pulsating
electric	 and	 magnetic	 fields	 created	 by	 a	 moving	 electric	 charge	 (figure	 1.6).	 One
example	 of	 an	 electromagnetic	 field	 is	 that	 generated	 by	 electrons	 moving	 back	 and
forth	in	a	radio	antenna.	Thus	radio	and	radar	waves;	infrared,	visible,	and	UV	light;	X
rays;	 and	 gamma	 rays	 constitute	 what	 is	 called	 the	 electromagnetic	 spectrum,	 from
low	 frequency	 and	 low	 energy	 (radio	 waves)	 to	 high	 frequency	 and	 high	 energy
(gamma	 rays).	 Newton	 first	 proposed	 that	 light	 rays	 were	 made	 of	 particles,	 but
subsequent	 experiments	 suggested	 a	 wavelike	 nature	 for	 light.	 The	 wave	 nature	 of
light	was	put	on	strong	theoretical	footing	by	the	physicist	James	Clerk	Maxwell	in	the
second	 half	 of	 the	 nineteenth	 century.	 However,	 this	 theory	 failed	 to	 explain	 the
photoelectric	effect!	The	revisiting	of	the	wave/particle	duality	by	Einstein	became,	as
we	 just	 saw,	 a	 turning	 point	 in	 physics.	 We	 know	 today	 that	 light	 can	 be	 seen	 as
packets	 of	 electromagnetic	 energy	 (particles	 called	 photons)	 and	 as	 waves.	 Its
corpuscular	 and	 wavelike	 nature	 can	 be	 revealed	 in	 different	 experiments,	 using
different	 instruments;	 there	 is	 no	 contradiction	 between	 these	 two	 aspects	 of	 light.
The	dual	nature	of	light	is	now	fully	accepted	by	all	physicists.

nature,	 but	 so	 does	 matter.	 This	 is	 how	 this	 other	 duality,	 that	 of	 matter,	 was
demonstrated.	By	the	1910s,	scientists	had	shown	that	matter	is	composed	of	atoms

Interestingly,	 the	 spectrum	 of	 the	 emitted	 light	 consists	 of	 discrete	 bright	 lines	 on	 a

image	 of	 emission	 spectra.	 Absorption	 spectra,	 as	 we	 saw	 earlier,	 are	 used	 to

(right)	parts	of	the	visible	spectrum.

In	1913,	the	physicist	Niels	Bohr	proposed	that	atomic	spectra	were	the	result	of
orbiting	 electrons	 releasing	 energy	 in	 the	 form	 of	 photons	 (quanta	 of	 light)	 when
excited	 in	 some	 way,	 by	 electrons,	 photons,	 or	 chemical	 reactions,	 for	 example.	 In
this	scenario	the	electrons	absorbed	the	provided	energy	and	reemitted	it	in	the	form
of	 photons	 by	 dropping	 back	 to	 their	 original,	 or	 at	 least	 lower,	 energy	 level.
Absorption	 spectra	 were	 caused	 by	 the	 reverse	 phenomenon:	 incident	 light	 of	 a
particular	frequency	was	absorbed	by	electrons	that	were	thus	bumped	up	to	a	higher
energy	level.	What	was	exciting	about	this	interpretation	was	the	notion	that	electrons
in	matter	could	receive	energy	and	release	it	only	in	a	quantized—that	is,	discrete—
manner.	 Remember	 that	 Einstein	 had	 demonstrated	 quantized	 energy	 acquisition	 by
electrons	in	the	photoelectric	effect	but	not	quantized	energy	release	(which	does	not
occur	 in	 the	 photoelectric	 effect	 anyway).	 Bohr	 thus	 proposed	 the	 notion	 of	 discrete
electronic	orbits	around	the	atomic	nucleus.	Electrons	acquiring	energy	in	the	form	of
quanta	of	light	are	forced	into	higher,	more	energetic	orbits.	Once	there	they	can	fall
back	 to	 a	 lower	 energy	 state	 (a	 lower	 orbit)	 and	 emit	 a	 quantum	 of	 light.	 These
quanta	 of	 light	 are	 emitted	 (or	 absorbed)	 at	 very	 specific	 frequencies,	 explaining	 the
narrow	 (in	 frequency	 or	 wavelength)	 lines	 of	 emission	 and	 absorption	 spectra.	 This
also	 meant	 that	 electron	 orbits	 were	 themselves	 quantized:	 an	 electron	 in	 an	 atom
could	 not	 assume	 any	 energy	 level,	 only	 some	 such	 levels	 were	 possible.	 Electronic
transitions	 between	 energy	 levels	 are	 known	 as	 quantum	 leaps	 or	 quantum	 jumps,
expressions	that	have	joined	our	everyday	language.
Problems	 with	 this	 simple	 (but	 revolutionary)	 model	 soon	 arose.	 While	 Bohr’s
theory	 explained	 well	 the	 spectrum	 of	 hydrogen	 (an	 element	 containing	 a	 single
electron	around	its	nucleus),	it	did	not	work	in	the	case	of	another	gas,	helium,	which
has	 two	 electrons.	 Another	 problem	 was	 that,	 according	 to	 classical	 physics,
electrons	in	orbit	around	an	atomic	nucleus	cannot	be	stable.	If	they	are	thought	of	as
little	 bodies	 carrying	 a	 negative	 electric	 charge	 in	 orbit	 around	 the	 nucleus	 (much	 as
planets	 are	 in	 orbit	 around	 the	 Sun),	 the	 theory	 of	 electromagnetic	 radiation
demonstrates	that	 electrons,	being	 electrically	charged	 moving	objects,	 must	radiate
energy	 and	 soon	 fall	 into	 the	 nucleus.	 Matter	 then	 is	 not	 stable!	 But	 of	 course,	 we
know	 that	 matter	 is	 stable.	 Clearly,	 the	 electrons-in-orbit	 model	 is	 incomplete	 or
wrong,	or	merely	a	first	step.4	What	was	left	of	Bohr’s	model,	however,	was	the	idea
of	quantum	jumps	occurring	in	matter	and	the	correlation	between	atomic	spectra	and
electronic	energy	levels.
In	1923	the	young	scientist	Louis	de	Broglie	(a	genuine	duke)	published	the	results
of	his	Ph.D.	dissertation,	a	series	of	cogitations	inspired	by	Einstein’s	idea	that	mass
and	 energy	 are	 two	 facets	 of	 the	 same	 coin.	 Since,	 thought	 de	 Broglie,	 both	 mass
and	 light	 are	 forms	 of	 energy,	 matter	 (which	 has	 mass)	 and	 light	 should	 be
describable	 using	 the	 same	 mathematical	 formalism.	 He	 showed	 that,	 indeed,
electrons	could	be	mathematically	described	as	waves,	not	just	as	very	small	material
bodies!	 This	 great	 insight	 was	 demonstrated	 experimentally	 a	 few	 years	 later.	 (The

principle	that	electrons	are	waves	is	used	in	electron	microscopes.)	This	again	posed
a	 problem:	 what	 are	 electrons?	 Are	 they	 material	 objects	 (they	 had	 better	 be,
because	they	are	one	of	the	constituents	of	matter)	or	are	they	waves?	Or	else,	are
they	both?	These	questions	are	of	course	reminiscent	of	the	particle-wave	duality	for
light	that	we	examined	earlier.
The	 year	 1926	 saw	 the	 grand	 synthesis	 of	 Planck’s,	 Bohr’s,	 Einstein’s,	 and	 de
Broglie’s	 ideas	 into	 one	 single	 coherent	 theory:	 quantum	 mechanics.	 Werner
Heisenberg	 and	 Erwin	 Schrödinger	 demonstrated	 independently	 (using	 very	 different
mathematical	tools)	that	electrons	can	be	treated	as	three-dimensional	matter	waves
surrounding	 the	 atomic	 nucleus.	 In	 this	 picture,	 Bohr’s	 orbits	 are	 replaced	 by
electronic	 “clouds”	 and	 the	 electrons	 cease	 to	 be	 seen	 as	 single	 material	 points
revolving	around	the	nucleus,	as	planets	orbit	the	Sun.	In	the	new	model,	an	electron
is	 “delocalized,	 smeared	 out”	 and	 the	 cloud	 (also	 called	 an	 orbital)	 represents	 the
probability	of	finding	an	electron	in	the	region	of	space	occupied	by	the	cloud	(figure
1.8).	The	simplified	Schrödinger	equation	is

where	h	is	Planck’s	constant,	m	is	the	particle’s	mass,	V	is	the	potential	energy	that
depends	on	the	particle’s	position,	x	is	the	particle’s	position,	E	is	the	total	energy	of
the	 particle,	 Ψ	 is	 the	 wave	 function,	 and	 d2Ψ/dx2	 is	 its	 second	 derivative.	 The	 wave
function	 Ψ	 has	 no	 direct	 physical	 meaning,	 but	 generally	 speaking,	 wave	 functions
that	 satisfy	 the	 Schrödinger	 equation	 allow	 only	 certain	 energy	 (E)	 values	 for	 the
particle.	These	energy	values	are	thus	quantized.
The	 probabilistic	 interpretation	 of	 matter	 waves	 was	 proposed	 by	 the	 physicist
Max	Born,	who	realized,	soon	after	Schrödinger	and	Heisenberg	published	their	work,
that	 mathematically,	 Ψ2	 is	 the	 probability	 of	 finding	 a	 particle	 in	 a	 given	 region	 of
space.	Thus	Ψ2	is	a	probability	density.	When	one	thinks	about	this	interpretation	for
a	minute,	one	realizes	that	it	has	baffling	consequences.	For	the	first	time	in	physics,
it	 had	 been	 suggested	 that	 one	 could	 no	 longer	 pinpoint	 the	 position	 of	 a	 material
object!	Indeed,	how	does	one	pinpoint	a	wave	or	a	probability	density?
Not	 only	 that,	 the	 Schrödinger	 equation	 allows	 particles	 to	 overcome	 energy
barriers	 that	 would	 be	 considered	 classically	 impenetrable.	 Let	 us	 consider	 the
following	“classical”	example.	Imagine	a	billiard	ball	in	a	strong,	tall	box.	The	ball	can
be	pushed	around,	even	energetically,	but	in	no	case	do	we	expect	the	ball	to	escape
from	 the	 box.	 This	 is	 because	 the	 walls	 of	 the	 box	 constitute	 a	 solid	 barrier	 that	 the
ball	cannot	overcome.	This	is	not	what	is	happening	in	the	world	of	the	atom,	because
the	 Schrödinger	 equation	 allows	 subatomic	 particles	 to	 “tunnel”	 through	 energy
barriers	 that	 would	 have	 stopped	 these	 particles	 in	 a	 classical	 world.	 Figure	 1.9
describes	 the	 tunnel	 effect.	 A	 subatomic	 particle	 is	 shown	 as	 a	 wave	 present
between	two	potential	energy	“walls”	of	value	V0	(the	V	as	in	Schrödinger’s	equation)
that	classically	would	prevent	the	particle	from	escaping.
In	 reality,	 solutions	 to	 the	 Schrödinger	 equation	 show	 that	 the	 particle	 has	 a
nonzero	probability	of	penetrating	the	potential	barrier	and	finding	itself	in	the	outside

box	 without	 breaking	 them.	 And	 again,	 this	 is	 not	 simply	 the	 result	 of	 clever
mathematical	 tricks.	 We	 now	 know	 that	 radioactive	 α-decay,	 the	 phenomenon	 in
which	 radioactive	 substances	 (such	 as	 plutonium)	 emit	 helium	 nuclei	 (two	 protons
associated	with	two	neutrons	to	form	an	α	particle),	is	explained	by	the	tunnel	effect.

where	p	is	the	momentum	(mv),	q	represents	the	three	coordinates	of	space	(used	to
position	 any	 object	 in	 three-dimensional	 space),	 h	 is	 the	 Planck	 constant,	 and	 π	 is
3.14159…,	 making	 h/2π	 a	 constant	 number.	 The	 symbol	 ∆	 represents	 intrinsic
imprecision,	variation	in	the	measurements.	Thus	if	we	measure	the	particle’s	position
exactly,	∆q,	the	variation	in	position,	will	be	zero.	But	if	∆q	equals	zero,	then	∆p	must
be	equal	to	or	greater	than	h/2π	divided	by	zero.	This	means	that	the	imprecision	in
the	 measurement	 of	 the	 momentum	 (mass	 times	 velocity)	 is	 infinite!	 Heisenberg’s

where	 E	 is	 the	 energy	 of	 a	 particle	 and	 t	 its	 lifetime	 in	 an	 excited	 state.	 Since	 E	 =
mc2,	the	uncertainty	principle	allows	for	the	totally	counterintuitive	existence	of	virtual
particles!	Simple	algebra	shows	that	particles	can	materialize	from	nothing	and	return
to	 nothing	 if	 their	 lifetime	 ∆t	 is	 equal	 or	 smaller	 than	 (h/2π)/mc2.	 In	 other	 words,	 the
uncertainty	principle	makes	possible	the	creation	of	particles	from	nothing	at	all	if	they

uncertainty	principle,	we	should	think	of	empty	space,	a	perfect	vacuum,	as	brimming
with	virtual	particles	popping	in	and	out	of	existence.	Or,	to	put	it	differently,	when	the
uncertainty	principle	is	expressed	in	terms	of	energy	and	time,	it	shows	that	particles
can	 materialize	 from	 nothing,	 if	 only	 for	 a	 very	 short	 time	 (see	 appendix	 2).	 This
phenomenon	is	known	as	quantum	fluctuations	of	the	vacuum.	This	also	means	that	a
vacuum,	 empty	 space,	 contains	 energy.	 And	 yes,	 bizarre	 as	 it	 may	 seem,	 this	 socalled	zero-point	energy	does	exist.	The	Dutch	physicist	Hendrik	Casimir	calculated	in
1948	that	zero-point	energy	should	force	two	metal	plates	to	attract	each	other	when
brought	 sufficiently	 close	 together.	 The	 Casimir	 effect	 was	 tested	 in	 the	 laboratory
and	 verified.	 Therefore	 a	 vacuum	 contains	 energy,	 confirming	 the	 “reality”	 of	 virtual
particles	and	quantum	fluctuations.	Again,	what	may	have	been	seen	as	sophisticated
mathematics	 without	 physical	 basis	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 a	 law	 of	 nature.	 Heisenberg’s
uncertainty	principle	rules	the	subatomic	world.
Quantum	mechanics,	after	its	successful	application	to	the	properties	of	electrons,
was	quickly	applied	with	equal	success	to	the	cases	of	the	two	subnuclear	particles,

FORCES	OF	NATURE	AND	ELEMENTARY	PARTICLES
Ordinary	matter5	 is	 composed	 of	 nuclear	 particles,	 neutrons	 (electrically
neutral)	and	protons	(positively	charged),	that	combine	to	form	the	atom’s	nucleus.	As
we	 have	 seen,	 the	 nucleus	 is	 surrounded	 by	 negatively	 charged	 electrons	 that
counterbalance	the	positive	charge	of	the	nucleus.	Physicists	now	consider	electrons
to	be	truly	elementary	particles.	This	means	that	electrons	do	not	seem	to	have	any
kind	 of	 internal	 structure.	 Protons	 and	 neutrons	 are	 different	 from	 electrons.	 For
decades	 after	 their	 discovery	 they	 were	 thought	 to	 be	 elementary	 as	 well.	 Then
theoretical	 calculations	 and	 experiments	 with	 large-particle	 accelerators
demonstrated	 that	 this	 is	 not	 the	 case.	 We	 now	 know	 that	 protons	 and	 neutrons
(collectively	called	baryons,	meaning	“heavy”)	are	composed	of	three	subunits	each,
called	quarks,	with	two	“up”	quarks	and	one	“down”	quark	for	the	proton	and	one	up
quark	 and	 two	 down	 quarks	 for	 the	 neutron.	 As	 far	 as	 we	 know,	 quarks	 are	 truly
elementary	and	devoid	of	internal	structure.
Another	 category	 of	 elementary	 particles	 known	 to	 form	 ordinary	 matter,	 in
addition	 to	 baryons,	 is	 the	 lepton	 (meaning	 light)	 class,	 which	 contains	 negatively
charged	electrons	and	electrically	neutral	neutrinos.	The	mass	of	an	electron	is	about
1/2000th	that	of	a	proton	or	neutron.	Neutrinos	appear	to	possess	a	very	small	mass,
much	less	than	that	of	an	electron.	Neutrinos	interact	very	weakly	with	matter	and	are
produced	 in	 a	 certain	 type	 of	 radioactive	 decay,	 called	 β	 decay.	 They	 exist	 as	 free
particles	 in	 the	 universe,	 as	 they	 are	 produced	 by	 thermonuclear	 reactions	 taking
place	in	stars.	The	Sun	is	a	profuse	source	of	neutrinos,	which,	incidentally,	are	totally
harmless	for	living	organisms.
All	 these	 elementary	 particles	 must	 interact	 to	 produce	 matter	 as	 we	 know	 it.
They	 do	 this	 through	 the	 action	 of	 forces	 that	 must	 explain	 how,	 for	 example,
positively	 charged	 protons	 present	 in	 an	 atomic	 nucleus	 do	 not	 repel	 each	 other
instantly.	 Three	 such	 forces	 explain	 the	 stability	 of	 matter,	 while	 a	 fourth	 force
explains	 the	 action	 of	 gravity.	 Thus	 modern	 physics	 recognizes	 four	 fundamental
forces,	 the	 strong	 force,	 the	 electromagnetic	 force,	 the	 weak	 force,	 and	 the
gravitational	force.	They	are	characterized	as	follows:
	
•				The	strong	force	unites	quarks	inside	baryons.	Interestingly,	and	counterintuitively
(for	 most	 of	 us,	 anyway),	 the	 strong	 force	 is	 not	 that	 strong	 at	 extremely	 close
range,	 but	 it	 gets	 stronger	 as	 the	 distance	 between	 two	 quarks	 increases.	 This

explains	why	free	quarks	have	never	been	observed.	The	“left	over”	of	the	strong
force	(sometimes	called	the	nuclear	force)	unites	protons	and	neutrons	inside	the
nucleus	and	is	stronger	at	closer	range.
•				The	electromagnetic	force	governs	the	interactions	between	charged	particles.	It
is	attractive	when	two	particles	have	opposite	charges	(positive	and	negative)	and
repulsive	 when	 the	 charges	 are	 the	 same.	 It	 is	 weaker	 than	 the	 nuclear	 force	 at
close	 range,	 explaining	 why	 two	 protons	 do	 not	 repel	 each	 other	 when	 they	 are
present	 in	 the	 same	 nucleus	 but	 do	 so	 once	 the	 range	 of	 the	 nuclear	 force	 is
exceeded.	Electromagnetic	forces	determine	the	overall	structure	of	matter,	as	in
atoms	 where	 electrons	 surround	 a	 positively	 charged	 nucleus.	 The
electromagnetic	 force	 is	 100	 to	 1000	 times	 weaker	 than	 the	 strong	 force.	 Its
strength	 decreases	 with	 the	 square	 of	 the	 distance	 separating	 two	 particles	 (an
example	of	the	well-known	inverse	square	law).
•	 	 	 	 The	 weak	 force	 is	 also	 a	 type	 of	 nuclear	 force.	 Among	 others,	 it	 governs	 β−
decay,	 a	 radioactive	 process	 through	 which	 a	 neutron	 is	 converted	 into	 a	 proton
plus	 an	 electron	 and	 an	 antineutrino.	 Generally	 speaking,	 the	 weak	 force
determines	the	interactions	between	baryons	and	leptons.	The	weak	force	has	an
extremely	short	range	and	is	about	1	million	times	weaker	than	the	strong	force.
•	 	 	 	 The	 gravitational	 force	 is	 always	 attractive	 and	 is	 1039	 times	 weaker	 than	 the
strong	force.	It	governs	the	interactions	between	masses	and	follows	the	inverse
square	 law,	 as	 does	 the	 electromagnetic	 force.	 We	 saw	 earlier	 that	 the
gravitational	 force	 is	 in	 fact	 complex	 and	 results	 from	 the	 warping	 of	 space-time
by	objects	possessing	mass.
	
In	quantum	theory,	all	forces	correspond	to	fields,	regions	of	space	where	a	force
exists,	 and	 all	 four	 types	 of	 field	 are	 characterized	 by	 a	 given	 field	 particle	 (with	 its
dual	 wave/particle	 characteristic)—hence	 the	 existence	 of	 a	 third	 category	 of
particles	 to	 accompany	 baryons	 and	 leptons.	 Thus	 the	 strong	 force	 is	 mediated	 by
gluons,	 massless	 particles	 acting	 at	 very	 short	 range.	 The	 electromagnetic	 force	 is
mediated	 by	 the	 familiar	 photons,	 massless	 particles	 whose	 range	 is	 infinite	 (but
varies	as	the	inverse	square	law).	Then,	the	weak	force	is	mediated	by	the	exchange
of	Z0,	W+,	or	W−	field	particles	between	baryons	and	leptons.	The	field	particles	here
are	 very	 massive	 and	 hence	 very	 energetic.	 This	 makes	 their	 lifetime	 very	 short,
according	to	the	uncertainty	principle,	and	thus	makes	their	range	extremely	short	as
well.	 Finally,	 the	 gravitational	 force	 is	 governed	 by	 gravitons,	 massless	 hypothetical
particles,	with	infinite	range,	also	acting	according	to	the	inverse	square	law.
Where	does	this	lead	us	in	our	attempts	to	understand	the	origin	of	matter?	Going
back	to	the	theory	of	relativity,	we	understand	that	mass	(matter)	is	energy	and	thus
energy	is	matter.	Therefore	given	enough	energy	in	a	system,	it	is	possible	to	create
matter.	 It	 is	 then	 convenient	 to	 express	 units	 of	 mass	 in	 units	 of	 energy	 such	 as
electron	volts,	where	1	electron	volt	is	the	energy	acquired	by	an	electron	submitted
to	a	voltage	drop	of	1	volt.	Using	this	system,	and	knowing	that	the	mass	of	a	proton
is	 1.67	 ×	 10−24	 grams,	 its	 mass	 in	 energy	 units	 is	 1000	 million	 electron	 volts,

abbreviated	 as	 1	 GeV.	 In	 comparison,	 the	 mass	 of	 an	 electron	 is	 only	 0.5	 million
electron	volts	(MeV).	Current	particle	accelerators	and	colliders	achieve	energy	levels
of	 about	 200	 GeV.	 These	 machines	 are	 thus	 easily	 able	 to	 create	 matter	 from
energy;	 indeed,	 accelerators	 can	 create	 all	 sorts	 of	 subatomic	 particles.	 Therefore
the	equivalence	between	matter	and	energy	and	the	mechanisms	involved	have	been
experimentally	explored	for	many	years.
Now	 any	 system	 (which	 can	 be	 a	 small	 collection	 of	 atoms,	 a	 human	 body,	 a
galaxy,	 or	 even	 the	 whole	 universe)	 above	 a	 temperature	 of	 absolute	 zero	 emits
electromagnetic	 radiation	 proportional	 to	 its	 temperature,	 very	 much	 as	 a	 blackbody
does,	as	discussed	earlier.	In	scientific	notation,	temperature	is	expressed	in	degrees
Kelvin	(also	called	absolute,	where	absolute	zero	is	−273°	Celsius),	abbreviated	as	K.
Therefore	 a	 particular	 type	 of	 electromagnetic	 radiation,	 characterized	 by	 a	 certain
range	 of	 wavelengths	 and	 energies	 (radio	 waves,	 microwaves,	 infrared	 and	 visible
light,	 UV	 light,	 etc.)	 is	 associated	 with	 the	 equivalent	 temperature	 of	 a	 system.	 For
example,	a	temperature	of	300	K	is	close	to	room	temperature	and	a	little	below	that
of	 a	 human	 body.	 At	 this	 temperature,	 objects,	 including	 humans,	 emit	 primarily
infrared	light.	This	is	how	night	vision	goggles	work;	they	capture	infrared	photons	and
convert	 them	 into	 visible	 light.	 At	 10,000	 K	 (104	 K)	 or	 less,	 matter	 emits	 light	 in	 the
visible	 range,	 this	 visible	 light	 being	 composed	 of	 higher-energy	 photons.	 At	 105	 K,
matter	emits	UV	light,	which	at	108	K	becomes	X	rays,	and	at	109	K,	it	emits	gamma
rays	 that	 can	 materialize,	 as	 we	 have	 seen,	 into	 electron-antielectron	 pairs.	 This	 is
because	 the	 energy	 carried	 by	 gamma-ray	 photons	 is	 high	 enough	 to	 create	 matter
according	to	E	=	mc2.
Of	 course,	 no	 solid,	 liquid,	 or	 even	 gaseous	 matter	 can	 exist	 above	 a	 few
thousand	 K;	 at	 these	 temperatures	 all	 matter	 exists	 in	 its	 fourth	 state,	 a	 plasma,	 in
which	atomic	nuclei	and	some	electrons	are	no	longer	bound.	At	higher	temperatures
still,	matter	ceases	to	exist	and	is	turned	into	radiation	of	very	short	wavelength	and
hence	very	high	equivalent	temperature.	Thus	it	is	possible	to	establish	a	relationship
between	 the	 temperature	 of	 a	 system	 and	 the	 particular	 state	 (matter	 or	 radiation)
this	 system	 is	 in.	 As	 far	 as	 subatomic	 particles	 are	 concerned,	 this	 state	 directly
depends	 on	 the	 mass-energy	 content	 of	 the	 system.	 Theoretical	 calculations	 and
particle	accelerator	experiments	have	shown	that	quarks,	the	constituents	of	protons
and	 neutrons,	 can	 exist	 stably	 only	 below	 1014	 to	 1013	 K.	 Protons	 and	 neutrons	 are
stable	 below	 1012	 K,	 whereas	 electrons	 stabilize	 below	 4	 ×	 109	 K.	 Atoms—that	 is,
nuclei	 surrounded	 by	 their	 electronic	 clouds—become	 stable	 in	 the	 range	 of	 3000	 to
20,000	K.
In	addition,	theoretical	calculations	and	experiments	have	shown	that	at	very	high
energies	 (very	 high	 temperatures),	 the	 four	 forces	 of	 nature	 are	 united	 as	 one,	 a
unified	superforce	 of	 sorts,	 because	 field	 particles	 (gluons,	 photons,	 the	 weak	 force
particles,	 and	 gravitons)	 are	 not	 differentiated.	 As	 temperature	 goes	 down,	 gravity
separates	out,	leaving	the	strong,	electromagnetic,	and	weak	forces	together.	Then,
the	 strong	 force	 separates	 from	 the	 electroweak	 force,	 and,	 next,	 the	 weak	 and
electromagnetic	 forces	 separate.	 In	 that	 sense,	 very	 high	 energy	 levels	 are

“pregnant”	with	the	four	forces	and	mass,	two	prerequisites	to	form	matter.
Thus	to	build	a	universe	that	has	a	beginning	in	a	very	small	region	of	space,	one
needs	 extremely	 high	 temperatures	 and	 energy	 levels	 high	 enough	 to	 lead	 to	 the
production	 of	 matter,	 and	 these	 high	 temperatures	 must	 then	 decrease	 to	 induce
stable	 matter	 particles,	 and	 subsequently	 atoms,	 to	 exist.	 Relativity	 provides	 a
unification	 of	 the	 concepts	 of	 mass	 and	 energy	 (special	 relativity),	 and	 space	 and
gravitation	 (general	 relativity).	 Quantum	 physics,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 unifies	 the
concepts	 of	 particles	 and	 radiation.	 What	 is	 still	 missing,	 however,	 is	 a	 unification	 of
general	 relativity	 and	 quantum	 physics.	 To	 achieve	 this	 goal,	 scientists	 will	 have	 to
develop	 a	 quantum	 theory	 of	 gravity—in	 particular,	 a	 theory	 that	 can	 explain	 the
behavior	 of	 space-time,	 gravity,	 and	 energy	 under	 the	 extreme	 conditions	 of	 density
that	 prevailed	 at	 the	 moment	 of	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 This	 has	 yet	 to	 be	 accomplished.
Nevertheless,	 we	 shall	 see	 in	 chapter	 2	 that	 both	 theories	 account	 very	 well	 for	 the
properties	of	the	known	universe,	although	they	leave	the	mysteries	of	the	beginning
still	 unsolved.	 As	 we	 now	 understand	 it,	 the	 universe	 must	 have	 begun	 in	 a
tremendous	flash	of	released	energy:	the	Hot	Big	Bang.	This	energy	then	coalesced
into	material	mass,	interacting	via	force	field	particles,	and	left	a	large	number	of	free
photons	behind.	This	scenario	will	be	studied	in	the	next	chapter.

CONCLUSIONS
Relativity	and	quantum	physics	both	provide	accurate	descriptions	of	the
world.	The	realm	of	relativity	is	the	very	large	and	the	very	fast.	Both	regimes	exist	in
the	universe,	where	galaxies,	thousands	of	light-years	in	size,	recede	at	tremendous
velocities.	 Relativity	 is	 the	 science	 of	 space.	 Quantum	 physics	 deals	 with	 the
ultramicroscopic,	 the	 realm	 of	 the	 atom,	 the	 molecule,	 and	 their	 constituents.	 The
cosmos	 basically	 contains	 only	 two	 things,	 radiation	 and	 matter,	 both	 present	 in	 a
vast	 amount	 of	 space.	 By	 understanding	 radiation	 and	 its	 interactions	 with	 matter
(quantum	 physics)	 and	 by	 understanding	 that	 radiation	 and	 matter	 are	 two	 forms	 of
energy	 (relativity),	 we	 can	 build	 a	 model	 explaining	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 universe	 and
the	matter	it	contains.
On	 a	 final	 note,	 it	 is	 legitimate	 to	 wonder	 whether	 quantum	 physics	 and	 relativity
have	any	impact	on	our	daily	lives.	In	the	case	of	relativity,	the	answer	is	probably	not
much	(with	the	exception	of	nuclear	weapons	and	nuclear	reactors,	direct	spinoffs	of
E	 =	 mc2);	 its	 realm	 seems	 so	 far	 limited	 to	 pure	 science.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 quantum
physics,	 the	 answer	 is	 a	 definite	 yes.	 Our	 entire	 electronics	 industry	 is	 based	 on
quantum	 theory.	 As	 Leon	 Lederman,	 Nobel	 laureate	 for	 physics,	 once	 said,	 “If
everything	we	understand	about	the	atom	stopped	working,	the	GNP	[gross	national
product]	would	go	to	zero.”

The	most	incomprehensible	thing	about	the	universe	is	that	it	is

wentieth-century	 physics,	 with	 its	 precise	 description	 of	 matter,
energy,	 and	 radiation,	 was	 merged	 with	 astronomical	 observations
to	provide	an	account	of	the	birth	of	the	universe	consistent	with	the
laws	 of	 nature.	 These	 efforts	 resulted	 in	 the	 Big	 Bang	 model	 for	 the	 creation	 of	 the
cosmos.	Since	we	do	not	(yet)	know	how	to	create	a	universe	in	the	laboratory,	some
of	 the	 Big	 Bang	 theory	 relies	 on	 mathematical	 and	 computer	 models.	 However,	 the
sciences	 of	 astrophysics	 and	 high-energy	 particle	 physics	 provide	 much	 empirical
evidence	to	support	the	theory	in	its	entirety.	In	this	chapter	we	will	see	how	the	Big
Bang	 model	 works.	 We	 will	 also	 see	 that	 the	 formation	 of	 stars	 and	 planets	 was	 a
direct	 consequence	 of	 the	 stabilization	 of	 matter,	 once	 the	 temperature	 of	 the
universe	 had	 dropped	 sufficiently,	 after	 a	 significant	 period	 of	 expansion	 of	 the

COSMOLOGY:	THE	BIG	BANG	MODEL
We	saw	in	chapter	1	that	Einstein’s	general	relativity	predicts	an	unstable
universe	beginning	with	a	singularity	characterized	by	zero	space	and	infinite	energy.
Using	 the	 equations	 of	 general	 relativity,	 the	 Belgian	 priest	 and	 university	 professor
Georges	 Lemaître	 suggested	 in	 1927	 that	 the	 universe	 could	 have	 started	 from	 a
rapidly	 expanding	 “primeval	 atom,”	 as	 he	 called	 it.	 By	 this	 he	 meant	 a	 very	 small
region	 of	 expanding	 superdense	 time-space	 from	 which	 all	 matter	 and	 radiation

originated.	 This,	 however,	 did	 not	 solve	 the	 question	 of	 infinite	 energy.	 Infinities	 are
not	welcome	in	science.	In	fact,	nobody	knows	what	infinite	energy	is.	Therefore	the
Lemaître-Einstein	 model,	 interesting	 as	 it	 may	 be,	 cannot	 be	 used	 to	 make
predictions	 regarding	 the	 properties	 of	 space-time	 at	 time	 zero,	 the	 moment	 of	 the
Big	 Bang.	 Nonetheless,	 1927	 should	 be	 considered	 the	 birth	 year	 of	 the	 Big	 Bang
model,	even	though	nobody	called	it	that	when	this	hypothesis	was	first	put	forth.	Let
us	first	consider,	then,	what	happened	a	very	short	time	after	time	zero	and	avoid	for
now	the	infinite	energy	problem.	We	will	return	to	speculations	regarding	time	zero	at
the	end	of	this	section.
An	 extremely	 important	 clue	 to	 the	 birth	 of	 the	 universe	 was	 revealed	 when	 the
temperature	of	the	cosmos	was	measured.	The	temperature	of	intergalactic	space	is
not	 zero	 Kelvin	 (K).	 Space	 is	 actually	 pervaded	 by	 a	 background	 radiation	 of	 2.7	 K,
with	an	energy	distribution	like	that	of	a	blackbody,	and	a	peak	wavelength	of	2	mm
corresponding	 to	 a	 photon	 energy	 of	 0.00062	 electron	 volts	 (eV),	 placing	 this
radiation	 in	 the	 microwave	 range	 (remember	 that	 any	 temperature	 above	 0	 K	 is
characterized	 by	 a	 given	 electromagnetic	 radiation	 wavelength).	 This	 very	 weak
cosmic	 microwave	 background	 radiation	 is	 uniformly	 distributed	 in	 all	 directions
around	 us	 and	 thus	 fills	 the	 universe.	 Human	 eyes	 are,	 of	 course,	 unable	 to	 detect
electromagnetic	radiation	below	the	range	of	visible	light,	but	our	radio	antennae	are
able	 to	 do	 so,	 which	 is	 how	 scientists	 discovered	 this	 universal	 microwave
background.	 What	 is	 its	 origin?	 How	 is	 it	 that	 microwave	 photons	 are	 filling	 the
universe?	 Is	 there	 a	 correlation	 between	 this	 radiation	 and	 the	 beginning	 of	 the
universe?
As	 covered	 in	 chapter	 1,	 we	 know	 that	 the	 universe	 is	 expanding	 (remember
galactic	redshifts).	If	we	were	hypothetically	to	run	the	expansion	clock	backward,	we
would	 see	 that	 as	 the	 universe	 became	 smaller	 and	 smaller,	 the	 microwave
background	 radiation	 density	 would	 become	 higher	 and	 higher,	 until	 it	 reached	 an
enormous	value.	Also,	since	space	would	be	shrinking,	the	microwave	radiation	would
be	blue-shifted	and	gain	more	and	more	energy,	until	it	too	would	reach	an	enormous
level.	In	a	shrinking	universe,	the	microwave	background	would	turn	into	infrared	light,
then	 into	 visible	 light,	 and	 subsequently	 into	 short-wavelength	 light	 that	 human	 eyes
cannot	perceive.	Since	the	energy	density	of	the	universe	would	increase	drastically,
so	would	its	temperature.	We	can	even	imagine	a	point	at	which	the	temperature	and
energy	density	would	be	so	high	that	matter	particles	could	no	longer	exist	stably.	If
we	 mentally	 reverse	 the	 process,	 in	 an	 expanding	 universe	 starting	 from	 very	 high
photon	density	and	energy,	the	radiation	becomes	weaker	and	weaker	as	time	goes
by.	 The	 photon	 density	 decreases	 and	 so	 does	 the	 energy	 associated	 with	 these
photons	because	of	the	redshift	caused	by	expansion.	Consequently,	the	temperature
of	the	universe	drops,	and	at	a	certain	point,	stable	matter	can	exist.
Thinking	 along	 these	 lines,	 the	 cosmic	 background	 radiation	 must	 represent	 the
“ashes,”	 the	 “afterglow”	 of	 the	 Big	 Bang!	 At	 one	 point	 in	 time,	 the	 young	 universe
must	 have	 been	 a	 reservoir	 of	 enormously	 intense	 radiation	 at	 extremely	 high
temperature.	This	raises	the	question	of	how	old	the	universe	is.	Based	on	the	rate	of

expansion,	 itself	 calculated	 from	 the	 velocity	 of	 the	 most	 distant	 galaxies	 observable
today,	 the	 age	 of	 the	 universe	 is	 about	 12	 to	 15	 billion	 years	 (see	 appendix	 3).
Extrapolating	 back	 in	 time,	 it	 is	 then	 possible	 to	 calculate	 the	 temperature	 of	 the
universe	 when	 it	 was	 extremely	 small,	 fractions	 of	 a	 second	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang.
Avoiding	 infinities	 “à	 la	 Einstein,”	 we	 can	 calculate	 that	 10−43	 second	 after	 the	 Big
Bang,	the	temperature	of	the	universe	was	1031	K	and	its	radius	was	3	×	10−35	meter.
This	is	many	orders	of	magnitude	smaller	than	the	radius	of	a	proton,	putting	the	justborn	 universe	 squarely	 in	 the	 submicroscopic	 realm	 of	 quantum	 theory.	 Also,	 as
matter	 cannot	 exist	 at	 such	 a	 high	 temperature,	 it	 is	 present	 as	 very	 energetic
radiation	(or,	more	precisely,	the	conversion	of	radiation	into	matter	does	not	lead	to
stable	 matter	 because	 the	 temperature	 is	 too	 high).	 Nevertheless,	 calculations
indicate	 that	 at	 that	 time,	 the	 force	 of	 gravity	 was	 already	 separated	 from	 the	 three
other	forces	(strong,	weak,	and	electromagnetic),	even	though	stable	matter	did	not
yet	exist.
It	may	surprise	the	reader	that	gravity	existed	from	the	beginning,	in	the	absence
of	 stable	 matter	 particles.	 However,	 we	 must	 remember	 that	 energy	 possesses
mass.	Therefore	at	extremely	high	energies,	we	find	a	considerable	amount	of	mass,
hence	 the	 existence	 of	 gravity.	 Also,	 at	 such	 a	 high	 energy	 density,	 the	 curvature	 of
the	universe	must	have	been	enormous	and	we	must	also	remember	that	curvature	of
space	 is	 gravity.	 Gravity	 was	 the	 first	 force	 to	 separate,	 because	 as	 temperature
decreased,	the	mass-energy	present	in	the	expanding	volume	decreased	as	well.
The	 rest	 of	 the	 timetable	 then	 goes	 as	 shown	 in	 the	 following	 table,	 where	 the
radius	 is	 that	 of	 the	 universe	 in	 meters,	 H	 represents	 hydrogen,	 D	 is	 deuterium	 (the
heavy	isotope	of	hydrogen)	and	He	is	helium:

field	 particles)	 separated.	 Then	 matter	 particles	 with	 highest	 mass	 energy	 started
stabilizing,	followed	by	those	with	less	mass	energy.	This	is	because	matter	is	stable
when	 temperature	 is	 below	 its	 energy	 equivalent	 divided	 by	 1.5k,	 where	 k	 is	 the
Boltzmann	constant,	a	number	relating	energy	and	temperature.	Thus	the	stabilization
temperature	 is	 T	 =	 E/1.5k.	 Knowing	 that	 E	 =	 mc2,	 and	 knowing	 m,	 the	 mass	 of
elementary	particles,	one	can	calculate	their	energy	equivalent.	This	value	of	E	is	then
used	 to	 calculate	 T.	 Since	 quarks	 are	 more	 massive	 than	 baryons	 (protons	 and
neutrons),	which	in	turn	are	more	massive	than	electrons,	quarks	stabilized	first	after
the	 Big	 Bang	 (when	 the	 universe	 was	 only	 80	 cm	 in	 diameter,	 the	 size	 of	 a	 large
beach	 ball),	 followed	 by	 the	 baryons	 and	 finally	 the	 electrons	 as	 the	 universe
expanded	further	and	its	temperature	dropped	accordingly.	It	may	come	as	a	surprise
that	 baryons,	 composed	 of	 three	 quarks,	 are	 less	 massive	 than	 quarks	 themselves.
This	 is	 because	 quarks,	 as	 they	 unite	 to	 form	 baryons,	 release	 energy—and	 hence
mass—in	 the	 process.	 The	 same	 principle	 is	 at	 work	 in	 nuclear	 fusion	 (see	 the	 next
section).
It	should	be	noted	that	experimental	results	have	been	gathered	up	to	energies	of
200	GeV	(corresponding	to	a	temperature	of	2	×	1015	K)	in	particle	accelerators.	This
temperature	 corresponds	 to	 about	 10−10	 second	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 Therefore	 it	 is
fair	 to	 say	 that	 we	 understand	 quite	 a	 bit	 of	 the	 physics	 involved	 in	 the	 transition
between	radiation	and	matter	in	the	very	young	universe.	What	happened	before	that
time	can	presently	be	assessed	only	by	theory,	as	we	will	see	later.
The	timetable	of	the	creation	of	the	universe	contains	several	interesting	features.
First,	 it	 should	 be	 realized	 that	 protons	 constitute	 hydrogen	 nuclei.	 H	 is	 the	 simplest
element,	with	one	proton	surrounded	by	a	single	electron.	Deuterium	is	an	isotope	of
hydrogen;	 it	 contains	 a	 single	 proton	 and	 a	 single	 neutron	 in	 its	 nucleus.	 D	 has	 only
one	 electron,	 just	 like	 H,	 and	 it	 has	 the	 same	 chemical	 properties	 as	 its	 lighter
isotope.	 The	 second	 simplest	 element	 is	 helium,	 composed	 of	 two	 protons	 and	 two
neutrons	(in	its	most	abundant	form)	surrounded	by	two	electrons.	D	nuclei	stabilized
10−3	 second	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang,	 whereas	 He	 nuclei	 stabilized	 after	 100	 seconds.	 It
can	 also	 be	 seen	 that	 formation	 of	 H,	 D,	 and	 He	 neutral	 atoms	 took	 place	 when	 the
universe	was	400,000	years	old,	when	the	temperature	had	become	low	enough	for
atoms	to	exist.
It	 is	 also	 at	 that	 time	 that	 the	 universe	 became	 transparent.	 Indeed,	 before	 that
time,	starting	at	10−9	second,	the	universe	was	a	plasma	of	independent	particles	and
radiation.	In	a	plasma,	light	cannot	travel	very	far	because	of	strong	interactions	with
particles.	 Therefore	 the	 superhot	 young	 universe	 may	 have	 looked	 like	 a	 dense,
luminous	fog.
The	table	thus	mentions	only	two	elements	created	in	the	Big	Bang:	hydrogen	and
helium	[a	third	element,	lithium	(Li),	with	three	protons	and	three	neutrons	was	formed
in	trace	amounts].	It	turns	out	that	calculations	based	on	quantum	mechanics	predict
that	a	hot	Big	Bang	should	produce	these	two	elements	in	a	precise	ratio:	76%	H	and
24%	 He	 (with	 traces	 of	 D	 and	 Li).	 And	 lo	 and	 behold,	 this	 is	 exactly	 the	 H/He	 ratio
found	 in	 the	 universe	 at	 large	 today	 (plus	 the	 traces	 of	 D	 and	 Li)!	 This	 observation

clearly	reinforces	the	notion	that	the	universe’s	birth	conforms	to	the	Big	Bang	model.
Figure	 2.1	 provides	 a	 graphic	 representation	 of	 the	 major	 transitions	 that	 have
occurred	in	the	universe	since	the	Big	Bang.
How	 does	 one	 explain	 this	 76:24	 ratio?	 Protons	 and	 neutrons	 are	 made	 in	 equal
amounts	 in	 the	 Big	 Bang	 and	 stabilize	 at	 about	 1012	 K.	 At	 this	 temperature,	 the
nuclear	 force	 is	 not	 strong	 enough	 to	 allow	 stable	 proton-neutron	 interactions.
However,	 as	 has	 been	 demonstrated	 experimentally,	 starting	 at	 about	 1010	 K,	 these
stable	 interactions	 are	 made	 possible.	 But	 neutrons	 are	 slightly	 more	 massive	 than
protons	 (by	 about	 1.3	 million	 eV),	 meaning	 that	 the	 balance	 between	 neutrons	 and
protons	 will	 shift	 toward	 the	 latter	 as	 the	 temperature	 of	 the	 universe	 drops.	 This	 is
because	 the	 conversion	 of	 protons	 into	 neutrons	 and	 vice	 versa	 favors	 protons	 at
lower	 temperatures.	 By	 the	 time	 the	 nuclear	 force	 allows	 proton-neutron	 binding,
there	 are	 only	 twelve	 neutrons	 left	 for	 eighty-eight	 protons.	 The	 twelve	 neutrons	 will
unite	with	twelve	protons	to	make	six	helium	nuclei,	each	actually	originating	from	the
fusion	 of	 two	 deuterons	 (deuterium	 nuclei),	 each	 containing	 one	 proton	 and	 one
neutron.	 This	 step	 is	 called	 nucleosynthesis	 because	 atomic	 nuclei	 are	 being
synthesized.	 Then	 the	 remaining	 seventy-six	 protons	 will	 remain	 alone	 and	 will
become	 hydrogen	 nuclei	 that	 later	 will	 form	 the	 76	 percent	 hydrogen	 atoms	 once
these	 protons	 each	 capture	 an	 electron.	 The	 formation	 of	 nuclei	 heavier	 than	 helium
(other	 than	 the	 traces	 of	 D	 and	 Li)	 cannot	 proceed	 because	 the	 expansion	 of	 the
universe,	and	hence	a	great	decrease	in	particle	density,	prevents	further	interactions
between	nuclei.	This	also	means	that	the	synthesis	of	elements	of	atomic	mass	higher
than	4	(i.e.,	He)	must	have	taken	place	elsewhere,	and	not	in	the	Big	Bang.	This	point
will	be	discussed	in	the	next	section.

Taken	 together,	 Einstein’s	 unstable	 universe,	 the	 cosmic	 microwave	 background
radiation,	 the	 redshift,	 and	 the	 precise	 H:He	 ratio	 predicted	 by	 theory	 make	 an
extremely	 solid	 case	 for	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 universe	 through	 a	 hot	 Big	 Bang.	 Some
competing	theories,	such	as	a	steady-state	universe	that	is	expanding	but	has	existed
for	 all	 eternity,	 have	 been	 presented.	 However,	 these	 theories	 do	 not	 agree	 with
observations	 (nor	 can	 they	 explain	 the	 microwave	 background	 radiation)	 and	 hence
must	be	rejected.
For	 a	 variety	 of	 reasons,1	 including	 the	 fact	 that	 there	 exist	 in	 the	 universe	 stars
and	galaxies,	not	just	the	two	gases	H	and	He	in	a	uniform	and	dispersed	state,	many
scientists	now	accept	the	idea	of	an	inflationary	period	that	took	place	between	10−33
and	 10−32	 second	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 This	 rapid	 inflation	 brought	 the	 size	 of	 the
universe	from	3	×	10−27	m	to	10	cm.	At	the	end	of	inflation,	the	universe	had	ceased
to	 be	 a	 quantum	 object.	 By	 stretching	 the	 nascent	 universe	 so	 quickly,	 it	 is	 thought
that	 any	 subtle	 preexisting	 patchiness	 in	 the	 energy	 distribution	 would	 have	 been
maintained	because	full	thermal	equilibrium	would	have	been	prevented.	Once	energy
converted	 into	 matter,	 this	 patchiness	 was	 kept,	 and	 it	 is	 recognized	 today	 as	 stars
and	 galaxies.	 If	 there	 was	 indeed	 inflation	 that	 led	 to	 a	 nonuniform	 distribution	 of
matter,	 the	 cosmic	 microwave	 background	 radiation	 should	 also	 show	 subtle
nonuniformity	 because	 this	 would	 reflect	 the	 presence	 of	 heterogeneities	 from
practically	 the	 beginning.	 This	 was	 actually	 demonstrated	 by	 microwave	 detection
equipment	carried	by	satellites	and	high-altitude	balloons;	the	microwave	background
radiation	is	very	smooth,	but	it	is	not	completely	smooth.
In	 summary,	 the	 standard	 model	 for	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 universe	 is	 very	 solid.
Quantum	physics	and	relativity	provide	consistent	explanations	regarding	the	creation
of	space-time,	matter,	forces,	and	radiation.	Inflation	seems	to	explain	the	properties
of	 the	 universe	 as	 we	 know	 it	 today.	 However,	 most	 people	 want	 to	 know	 what
happened	at	the	Big	Bang	and	what	caused	it.	I	was	told	that	one	of	my	colleagues
once	 said	 in	 an	 introductory	 biology	 class,	 “The	 Big	 Bang,	 eh!	 Who	 pulled	 the
trigger?”	 Doubtlessly,	 he	 was	 being	 facetious.	 Nevertheless,	 people	 and	 scientists
want	 to	 know,	 if	 not	 who	 pulled	 the	 trigger,	 at	 least	 what	 pulled	 the	 trigger.
Unfortunately,	 no	 simple	 explanation	 can	 be	 provided	 yet.	 What	 happened	 at	 time
zero	 and	 how	 it	 happened	 are	 two	 questions	 at	 the	 ultimate	 frontiers	 of	 science.
Theorists	 are	 quite	 active	 in	 this	 area	 and	 the	 following	 are	 some	 propositions	 they
have	devised:
First,	 the	 universe	 at	 the	 Big	 Bang	 may	 not	 have	 had	 a	 size	 of	 zero.	 This
possibility	would	violate	the	uncertainty	principle	of	quantum	mechanics.	The	minimum
possible	 size	 in	 the	 universe’s	 timetable,	 1.62	 ×	 10−35	 m,	 is	 called	 the	 Planck	 length,
and	it,	together	with	the	Planck	time,	5.39	×	10−44	second	after	the	Big	Bang,	are	the
smallest	 “knowable”	 parameters	 for	 the	 nascent	 universe.2	 Thus	 time	 “zero”	 is	 not
really	 zero,	 and	 the	 same	 holds	 true	 for	 zero	 space.	 This	 avoids	 the	 problem	 of
infinite	energy	in	a	purely	Einsteinian	universe.
Next,	 the	 uncertainty	 principle	 allows	 the	 universe	 to	 have	 been	 created	 from
nothing!	 As	 we	 have	 seen,	 Heisenberg’s	 principle	 can	 be	 written	 ∆E	 ·	 ∆t	 ≥	 h/2π.

Following	this,	if	the	energy	content	of	the	universe	is	zero,	the	indeterminacy	of	E	is
also	zero.	The	consequence	of	this	concept	is	mindboggling,	because	if	∆E	=	0,	then
∆t	≥	(h/2π)/0,	meaning	that	∆t	 ≥	 ∞,	 which	 is	 an	 infinity	 (because	 any	 number	 divided
by	zero	is	an	infinity)!	Thus	the	universe	could	exist	for	an	infinite	time	(not	necessarily
in	 its	 present	 form,	 but	 still	 composed	 of	 matter	 and	 radiation)	 provided	 it	 contained
zero	energy.	But	is	the	universe’s	energy	content	zero?	Many	cosmologists	think	that
this	is	the	case	and	that	matter-energy	(that	is,	the	energy	equivalent	of	all	matter	in
the	 universe)	 is	 exactly	 balanced	 by	 negative	 gravitational	 energy.	 Even	 though
gravitation	 is	 always	 attractive,	 it	 can	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 form	 of	 negative	 energy
because	it	binds	matter	together.	Therefore	in	an	expanding	universe,	where	matter	is
being	dispersed,	gravitation	has	a	negative	sign.	The	idea	of	creating	a	universe	from
nothing	is	not	completely	wild;	we	have	seen	that	a	vacuum	is	full	of	virtual	particles,
as	demonstrated	by	the	Casimir	effect.	In	a	similar	scenario,	the	universe	could	have
been	 born	 from	 quantum	 fluctuations	 of	 the	 vacuum,	 with	 the	 universe	 tunneling	 (see
chapter	 1)	 into	 existence.3	 In	 that	 picture,	 there	 is	 no	 trigger:	 nothing	 but	 chance
caused	the	Big	Bang.
Then	 there	 is	 the	 question	 of	 what	 happened	 before	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 For	 many
scientists	 this	 is	 a	 philosophical	 rather	 than	 a	 scientific	 question.	 And	 we	 have	 seen
that	the	Planck	time	limits	our	ability	to	go	back	to	true	zero.	At	any	rate,	it	would	be
extremely	 difficult,	 if	 not	 impossible,	 to	 see	 what	 the	 universe	 looked	 like	 before	 it
reached	 an	 age	 of	 about	 400,000	 years.	 We	 have	 a	 chance	 to	 glimpse	 at	 what	 the
universe	 looked	 like	 after	 this	 time,	 by	 devising	 more	 and	 more	 powerful	 telescopes
that	 can	 reach	 farther	 and	 farther	 into	 the	 distant	 universe	 at	 higher	 and	 higher
redshift.	 For	 this,	 light	 from	 these	 distant	 objects	 needs	 to	 reach	 us,	 and	 we	 have
seen	 that	 the	 universe	 was	 not	 transparent	 to	 light	 until	 400,000	 years	 after	 its
creation.	Events	before	that	time	are	hidden	in	a	quantum	fog.4
Nevertheless,	 theorists	 are	 speculating	 on	 the	 properties	 of	 the	 universe	 around
the	 Planck	 time	 and	 have	 come	 up	 with	 models	 describing	 “bubble	 universes”	 (or
“multiverse”),	 in	 which	 our	 own	 universe	 is	 but	 a	 corner	 of	 a	 total	 cosmos	 containing
multiple,	isolated	universes.	These	bubble	universes	could	be	seen	as	tunneling	out	of
preexisting	 universes.	 Others	 think	 that	 time	 really	 had	 no	 beginning	 at	 all.	 In	 that
view,	space-time	itself	is	curved.	This	allows	for	space-time	to	be	finite	(as	imposed
by	a	model	involving	a	beginning	for	the	universe)	yet	to	have	no	boundary.	A	familiar
analogy	is	that	of	the	surface	of	a	sphere,	which	is	curved	and	finite	and	yet	has	no
boundaries.	 In	 that	 sense,	 the	 idea	 of	 a	 singularity	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 space-time
disappears.	 This	 concept	 reduces	 even	 further	 the	 need	 for	 a	 trigger	 and,	 together
with	 the	 uncertainty	 principle,	 does	 away	 with	 causality.	 In	 that	 sense,	 the	 universe
simply	is.
At	any	rate,	this	is	not	the	place	for	cosmological	speculations.	We	are	interested
in	the	origin	of	matter,	because	living	things	are	made	of	matter,	and	so	far,	we	have
seen	 that	 the	 creation	 of	 matter	 is	 a	 direct	 consequence	 of	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 However,
the	 Big	 Bang	 created	 only	 two	 elements,	 hydrogen	 and	 helium.	 Hydrogen	 is	 very
abundant	 in	 living	 matter	 (representing	 63	 percent	 of	 the	 human	 body	 by	 number	 of

atoms),	while	helium	is	completely	absent	from	molecules	that	constitute	life.	In	fact,
helium	is	a	very	unreactive	gas	and	could	not	have	become	one	of	the	constituents	of
living	 cells.	 But	 then	 where	 did	 all	 the	 other	 elements,	 such	 as	 carbon,	 oxygen,
nitrogen,	 and	 several	 metals	 such	 as	 calcium,	 iron,	 and	 magnesium,	 so	 prevalent	 in
living	cells,	come	from?	We	now	know	their	origin:	they	were	made	in	stars.

THE	GENESIS	OF	STARS	AND	PLANETS
The	 mechanism	 by	 which	 stars	 emit	 light	 is	 well	 understood.	 It	 can	 be
replicated	 on	 Earth	 by	 detonating	 nuclear	 fusion	 bombs,	 the	 most	 destructive
weapons	 known	 to	 humans.	 Much	 as	 fission	 bombs	 (the	 regular	 A-bombs)	 are	 the
result	 of	 an	 understanding	 of	 the	 mass-energy	 relationship	 provided	 by	 special
relativity,	 so	 fusion	 bombs	 (H-bombs)	 are	 unfortunately	 a	 direct	 spinoff	 of	 our
understanding	 of	 the	 way	 stars	 shine.	 Nuclear	 fusion,	 as	 in	 H-bombs,	 is	 the	 process
by	 which	 atomic	 nuclei	 are	 forced	 to	 fuse	 under	 high	 pressure	 and	 high	 temperature
conditions.	 This	 process	 results	 in	 the	 release	 of	 tremendous	 amounts	 of	 energy,
because	 atomic	 nuclei	 possess	 less	 energy	 than	 the	 free	 baryons	 composing	 them.
When	these	baryons	(protons	and	neutrons)	are	forced	together	to	form	new	nuclei,
the	 whole	 contains	 less	 energy	 than	 the	 parts.	 This	 excess	 energy	 is	 released	 in	 Hbombs	 as	 electromagnetic	 radiation	 and	 heat	 (another	 form	 of	 electromagnetic
radiation).	 This	 is	 also	 exactly	 the	 way	 stars	 function:	 they	 fuse	 atomic	 nuclei	 and
release	fusion	energy	and	light	into	space.
In	the	young	universe,	after	hydrogen	and	helium	were	synthesized,	nuclear	fusion
would	 not	 have	 been	 possible	 without	 concentrating	 these	 gases	 in	 parts	 of	 the
expanding	 universe.	 This	 is	 where	 the	 consequences	 of	 inflation	 may	 have	 played	 a
role.	 The	 slight	 variations	 seen	 in	 the	 distribution	 of	 the	 microwave	 background
radiation	 possibly	 correspond	 to	 heterogeneities	 of	 matter	 as	 well,	 these
heterogeneities	forming	a	considerable	time	before	stars	and	galaxies	appeared.	It	is
thought	 that	 these	 heterogeneities	 gave	 rise	 to	 large	 clouds	 of	 hydrogen	 and	 helium
synthesized	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang.	 These	 clouds,	 called	 protogalaxies,	 underwent
gravitational	 contraction	 between	 about	 400,000	 and	 150	 million	 years	 after	 the	 Big
Bang.	The	general	temperature	of	the	universe	dropped	from	3000	K	to	16	K	during
that	period.
However,	 as	 the	 protogalaxies	 contracted,	 their	 temperature	 increased	 because
the	 kinetic	 energy	 of	 the	 infalling	 gas	 was	 converted	 into	 heat.	 This	 temperature
increase	 is	 not	 to	 be	 confused	 with	 the	 general	 temperature	 of	 the	 universe,	 which
eventually	 dropped	 to	 2.7	 K.	 The	 temperature	 increase	 occurred	 locally,	 inside	 the
protogalaxies	only.	Over	time,	it	must	be	assumed	that	the	protogalaxies	fragmented
into	 smaller	 contracting	 clouds,	 the	 protostars.	 When	 the	 temperature	 inside	 the
contracting	 protostars	 reached	 15	 million	 K,	 the	 repulsive	 force	 between	 protons	 (H
nuclei	 stripped	 by	 heat	 of	 their	 electrons)	 was	 overcome	 and	 protons	 collided	 and
then	 fused	 to	 form	 helium	 nuclei.	 The	 stars	 lit	 up.	 Now,	 helium	 made	 in	 stars	 by	 the

fusion	of	two	hydrogen	nuclei	contains	two	protons	but	also	two	neutrons.	Where	are
the	 latter	 coming	 from?	 The	 hydrogen	 fusion	 mechanism	 has	 been	 elucidated	 and
looks	like	this:
H1	+	H1	→	D2	+	β++	ν,
where	H1	represents	a	proton,	D2	is	a	deuterium	nucleus	composed	of	a	proton	and	a
neutron,	 β+	 is	 a	 positive	 electron	 (also	 called	 antielectron	 or	 positron),	 and	 ν	 is	 a
neutrino.	This	means	that	in	the	reaction,	one	proton	is	conserved	and	the	other	one
is	 converted	 into	 a	 neutron	 by	 emission	 of	 a	 positron	 and	 a	 neutrino	 (through	 the
action	of	the	weak	force).	The	superscripts	represent	the	number	of	baryons	present
in	each	nucleus.
Then	the	reaction	proceeds	as	follows:
D2	+	H1	→	He3	+	γ,
where	He3	is	the	light	isotope	of	helium,	containing	two	protons	and	one	neutron,	and
γ	 is	 electromagnetic	 radiation	 of	 very	 high	 frequency.	 In	 the	 next	 step	 two	 of	 these
helium	nuclei	fuse:

He3	+	He3	→	He4	+	2H1,
where	 He4	 is	 the	 isotope	 of	 helium	 containing	 two	 protons	 and	 two	 neutrons.	 This
series	 of	 reactions	 is	 called	 the	 pp-chain.	 In	 other	 words,	 stars	 fuse	 hydrogen	 to
make	 helium,	 and	 large	 amounts	 of	 energy	 are	 also	 produced.	 The	 fusion	 reaction
has	two	important	consequences:	first,	the	energy	provided	by	the	reaction	stabilizes
the	 star	 and	 prevents	 gravitational	 collapse	 under	 its	 own	 weight.	 Second,	 it	 is
expected	 that,	 as	 a	 star	 ages,	 its	 H:He	 ratio	 will	 decrease,	 as	 hydrogen	 is	 being
consumed	 to	 synthesize	 helium.	 Scientists	 have	 actually	 observed	 this	 process.	 The
helium	content	of	the	Sun’s	core,	for	example,	is	very	far	from	the	primeval	H:He	ratio
of	76	percent	to	24	percent.	The	Sun,	which	is	about	5	billion	years	old,	contains	38
percent	H	and	62	percent	He	in	its	core.	Another	chain	of	reactions,	called	the	carbon
cycle,	also	powers	stars,	and	it,	too,	results	in	the	fusion	of	hydrogen	into	helium	with
release	of	energy.	It	is	called	the	carbon	cycle	because	its	initial	step	is	to	fuse	one
carbon	 nucleus	 with	 one	 hydrogen	 nucleus	 to	 make	 a	 nitrogen	 nucleus.	 Carbon	 is
regenerated	at	a	later	stage	and	cycled	back	into	the	chain.
In	 fact,	 nuclear	 fusion	 in	 stars	 does	 not	 stop	 at	 the	 formation	 of	 helium.	 It	 has
been	 shown	 that	 all	 elements	 up	 to	 iron	 are	 synthesized	 in	 the	 core	 of	 stars.	 This
happens	after	the	star	has	exhausted	its	hydrogen	and	starts	using	helium	as	nuclear
fuel.	This	process	is	made	possible	by	the	gravitational	contraction	of	the	helium	core,
which	brings	its	temperature	to	100	million	K	and	allows	helium	fusion.	The	first	step
is	 the	 fusion	 of	 three	 helium	 nuclei	 to	 make	 carbon.	 Through	 a	 complicated	 chain	 of
reactions,	more	helium	nuclei	fuse	with	the	newly	synthesized	carbon	to	form	heavier
elements,	 such	 as	 neon,	 sodium,	 and	 magnesium,	 until	 iron	 is	 reached.	 Iron,	 which
contains	 twenty-six	 protons	 (and	 a	 variable	 number	 of	 neutrons,	 depending	 on	 the
isotope)	 is	 the	 most	 stable	 element	 and	 can	 be	 fused	 with	 other	 nuclei	 only	 under

temperature	 conditions	 not	 found	 in	 normal	 stars.	 However,	 iron	 is	 certainly	 not	 the
heaviest	 possible	 element;	 elements	 containing	 up	 to	 103	 protons	 have	 been
identified.	Where	do	these	come	from?	To	understand	their	origin,	one	must	first	learn
about	the	fate	of	stars.
Our	Sun	is	about	5	billion	years	old	and	has	enough	fuel	left	to	shine	for	another	8
billion.	 However,	 it	 will	 not	 remain	 the	 same	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 its	 life.	 As	 hydrogen	 is
being	 exhausted,	 and	 as	 helium	 fusion	 starts	 proceeding,	 the	 inner	 core	 of	 a	 star
heats	up,	as	we	saw	earlier.	One	consequence	of	this	higher	core	temperature	is	the
expansion	of	the	outer	shell	of	the	star,	which	becomes	cooler.	Such	stars	are	called
red	 giants	 because	 their	 diameter	 expands	 enormously	 and	 their	 cooler	 outer	 layer
emits	 light	 in	 the	 less	 energetic	 red	 region	 of	 the	 spectrum.	 The	 Sun	 will	 eventually
become	a	red	supergiant,	engulfing	and	incinerating	Earth.	When	fusion	in	the	core	of
a	red	supergiant	stops,	the	star	collapses	and	becomes	a	white	dwarf,	whose	fate	is
to	become	an	extinguished	star	once	all	fusion	reactions	stop.
Stars	that	are	significantly	more	massive	than	the	Sun	experience	a	very	different
fate.	When	such	a	star	reaches	the	end	of	its	red	supergiant	state,	its	core	collapse,
because	of	its	higher	mass,	is	extremely	violent	and	quick.	Instead	of	a	white	dwarf,
the	core	is	turned	into	an	extremely	dense	neutron	star	(where	protons	are	fused	with
electrons)	 or	 an	 even	 more	 dense	 black	 hole	 (so	 called	 because	 the	 density	 and
gravity	 of	 such	 an	 object	 are	 so	 high	 that	 even	 light	 cannot	 escape	 it).	 This	 violent
collapse	 causes	 a	 shock	 wave	 that	 makes	 the	 outer	 layers	 of	 the	 star	 explode	 and
blow	out	into	space	(figure	2.2).	 This	 phenomenon	 is	 called	 a	 supernova.	 The	 shock
wave	 brings	 the	 star’s	 outer	 layers	 to	 extremely	 high	 temperature,	 high	 enough	 to
force	atomic	nuclei	to	fuse	and	synthesize	elements	heavier	than	iron.	(This	is	a	great
simplification	of	the	actual	mechanisms	leading	to	the	synthesis	of	heavy	elements.)
Thus	this	is	where	chemical	elements	other	than	hydrogen	and	helium	come	from:
they	are	made	in	stars	and	released	into	space	through	the	violent	death	of	the	stars.
The	 amount	 of	 matter	 released	 into	 space	 by	 a	 supernova	 explosion	 is	 numbered	 in
the	billions	of	billions	of	billions	of	tons	(about	1027	tons	or	more).	For	reference,	the
mass	 of	 Earth	 is	 only	 about	 6	 ×	 1021	 tons.	 Therefore	 a	 single	 supernova	 explosion
releases	 into	 space	 the	 equivalent	 of	 1,000,000	 Earths	 or	 more.	 Supernova	 events
are	not	rare;	they	occur	about	once	every	100	years	in	the	average	galaxy.	It	is	this
star	 dust	 that	 is	 at	 the	 origin	 of	 planets	 and	 second-generation	 stars—that	 is,	 stars
formed	from	the	remnants	of	supernova	explosions	mixed	with	primeval	hydrogen	and
helium.	The	Sun	is	such	a	second-generation	star.

Interestingly,	 deep	 space	 observations	 with	 the	 Hubble	 space	 telescope	 (named
after	 the	 discoverer	 of	 the	 galactic	 redshift-distance	 correlation)	 have	 revealed	 that
the	galaxies	at	high	redshift,	as	far	away	from	Earth	as	10	billion	light-years,	do	not
show	 the	 complex	 chemistry	 observed	 in	 nearer	 galaxies.	 This	 is	 because	 these
galaxies	 were	 formed	 only	 2	 billion	 years	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang	 and	 have	 not	 yet	 had
time	 (as	 we	 see	 them	 today)	 to	 produce	 much	 in	 terms	 of	 elements	 heavier	 than
hydrogen	and	helium.	The	existence	of	life	in	these	galaxies	(again,	as	we	see	them
today)	is	therefore	unlikely.
First-generation	 stars	 are	 those	 that	 were	 created	 directly	 from	 the	 primeval
hydrogen	 and	 helium	 clouds.	 These	 stars	 are	 called	 iron-poor	 because	 they	 contain
less	 iron	 than	 another	 class	 of	 stars,	 called	 second-generation	 stars,	 which	 contain
more	 iron	 (and	 many	 other	 elements)	 than	 first-generation	 stars	 because	 they
originate	 from	 the	 debris	 of	 supernova	 explosions.	 This	 debris,	 containing	 gases,
metals,	 and	 silicates	 in	 the	 form	 of	 dust,	 forms	 visible	 clouds	 in	 the	 universe	 (figure
2.3),	 and	 these	 clouds	 are	 the	 birthplace	 of	 second-generation	 stars.	 These	 clouds
can	 collapse	 and	 concentrate,	 perhaps	 through	 the	 shock	 wave	 of	 a	 nearby
supernova,	 to	 form	 rotating,	 further	 collapsing	 discs.	 As	 the	 center	 of	 the	 disc
reaches	 fusion	 ignition	 temperature,	 the	 second-generation	 star	 lights	 up.	 However,
this	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 the	 whole	 dust	 disc	 is	 involved	 in	 star	 formation.	 In	 fact,	 a

good	 portion	 of	 the	 disc	 remains	 separated	 from	 the	 newborn	 star	 and	 can	 actually
be	seen	as	an	opaque	halo	around	the	star.	Astronomers	have	detected	this	type	of
structure	 around	 several	 nearby	 stars	 (figure	 2.4);	 it	 is	 called	 a	 protoplanetary	 disc
because	it	is	thought	that	planets	originate	from	the	coalescence	of	the	outer	regions
of	the	disc.
In	 addition	 to	 H,	 He,	 metals,	 and	 silicates,	 a	 protoplanetary	 disc	 contains
molecules	commonly	found	in	space,	such	as	molecular	hydrogen	(H2),	water	(H2O),
nitrogen	(N2),	hydrogen	cyanide	(HCN),	carbon	monoxide	(CO),	and	ammonia	(NH3),
which	can	all	be	identified	by	their	specific	spectra.	These	compounds,	together	with
many	metals,	are	found	in	comets	that	sometimes	go	under	the	familiar	name	of	“dirty
snowballs.”	Comets	are	thought	to	be	composed	of	the	primordial	matter	that	formed
the	protoplanetary	disc	that	at	one	time	surrounded	the	Sun.	In	the	case	of	the	solar
system,	 the	 protoplanetary	 disc	 broke	 up	 into	 ten	 rings,	 representing	 the	 nine	 future
planets	 and	 the	 asteroid	 belt	 found	 between	 Mars	 and	 Jupiter.	 According	 to	 one
model,	the	heat	of	the	Sun	liquefied	the	frozen	gases,	with	the	result	that	the	grains	of
protoplanetary	 matter	 became	 moist	 and	 agglomerated	 (accreted)	 into	 chunks	 of
material.	 These	 chunks,	 called	 planetisimals,	 started	 colliding	 with	 one	 another
through	 gravitational	 attraction	 and	 accordingly	 grew	 larger,	 forming	 the	 planets	 and
their	 satellites.	 Computer	 simulations	 show	 that	 this	 process	 of	 accretion	 may	 have
taken	 100	 million	 years.	 This	 view	 was,	 however,	 challenged	 recently	 by	 the
observation	 of	 star	 and	 planet	 formation	 in	 the	 Orion	 nebula	 (visible	 with	 the	 naked
eye	as	the	middle	“star”	of	Orion’s	knife).	These	telescope	observations	indicate	that
planets	could	form	in	as	little	time	as	10	million	years.

The	 energy	 stored	 by	 accreting	 planetisimals	 (the	 result	 of	 the	 kinetic	 energy
possessed	 by	 colliding	 planetisimals)	 must	 have	 been	 considerable	 and,	 combined
with	 the	 heat	 of	 decaying	 radioactive	 elements	 present	 in	 them,	 may	 have	 liquefied
the	 growing	 planets.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 metals,	 which	 are	 more	 dense	 than	 silicates,
sank	 to	 the	 center	 of	 the	 newly	 formed	 planets,	 while	 silicates	 and	 other	 minerals
floated	 toward	 the	 surface.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 planets	 degassed	 and	 acquired
their	 original	 atmospheres	 consisting	 perhaps	 of	 hydrogen,	 helium,	 methane,	 water

Until	 recently	 there	 was	 no	 evidence	 that	 planetary	 systems	 exist	 around	 stars
other	 than	 the	 Sun.	 This	 view	 has	 changed	 considerably	 since	 1995,	 the	 date	 of	 the
discovery	of	the	first	extrasolar	planet	in	orbit	around	the	star	51	Pegasi.	At	the	end
of	 the	 year	 2000,	 about	 four	 dozen	 extrasolar	 planets	 had	 been	 discovered.	 Our
present	 instruments	 can	 detect	 only	 large	 extrasolar	 planets,	 the	 size	 of	 our	 Jupiter
(the	 largest	 planet	 in	 the	 solar	 system)	 or	 larger	 (figure	 2.5).	 Quite	 unexpectedly,
several	of	these	very	large	extrasolar	planets	have	orbits	around	their	stars	that	are
smaller	than	Earth’s	orbit	around	the	Sun.	These	planets	have	thus	been	dubbed	“hot
Jupiters.”	We	do	not	know	the	composition	of	these	planets,	but	what	we	do	know	is
that	our	theory	of	planet	formation	may	have	to	be	revised	once	we	learn	more	about
them.	 Indeed,	 until	 1995,	 the	 only	 planetary	 system	 we	 had	 been	 able	 to	 study	 was
our	 own,	 and	 in	 our	 case,	 smaller	 planets	 like	 Mercury,	 Venus,	 Earth,	 and	 Mars	 are
closest	 to	 the	 Sun.	 The	 gas	 giants—Jupiter,	 Saturn,	 Uranus,	 and	 Neptune—have
much	larger	orbits.	We	do	not	yet	understand	how	the	hot	Jupiters	could	have	formed
and	 remain	 stable	 so	 close	 to	 their	 stars	 in	 the	 extrasolar	 systems.	 This	 not	 to	 say
that	hot	Jupiters	are	gas	giants;	we	simply	have	no	information	on	them	yet.
The	 formation	 of	 planets	 begs	 the	 question	 of	 how	 life	 can	 appear	 on	 them.	 In
other	 words,	 under	 what	 conditions	 is	 a	 planetary	 body	 able	 to	 generate	 life?	 Since
the	 only	 life	 we	 know	 is	 based	 on	 carbon,	 hydrogen,	 oxygen,	 nitrogen,	 phosphorus,

sulfur,	 and	 a	 few	 other	 minor	 elements,	 these	 elements	 must	 be	 present	 on	 the
planet.	This	should	not	be	a	problem	with	planets	revolving	around	second-generation
stars.	Then	there	is	the	question	of	the	atmosphere.	This	problem	will	be	discussed	in
chapter	4.	For	now	let	us	just	say	that	there	is	general	agreement	on	the	absence	of
oxygen	 gas	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 of	 the	 young	 Earth.	 This	 should	 not	 have	 been	 an
impediment	to	the	appearance	of	life.	Indeed,	we	know	today	of	many	living	species
that	do	not	require	oxygen	for	proliferation	and	for	whom,	in	fact,	oxygen	is	very	toxic.
Hence,	 oxygen	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 is	 not	 a	 prerequisite	 for	 life.	 Other	 gases	 such	 as
methane,	 carbon	 monoxide,	 carbon	 dioxide,	 ammonia,	 and	 hydrogen	 sulfide	 can
perfectly	well	sustain	certain	life-forms,	as	we	will	see	in	the	next	chapter.
For	life	to	exist,	liquid	water	should	be	present,	at	least	part	of	the	time.	We	know
of	life	forms	deeply	embedded	in	Antarctic	ice,	but	these	cells	still	do	depend	on	the
percolation	of	liquid	surface	water	between	ice	crystals.	The	same	holds	true	for	cells
living	deep	inside	Earth’s	crust.	The	presence	of	liquid	water	directly	depends	on	the
planet’s	 distance	 from	 its	 star,	 hence	 its	 surface	 temperature	 and	 also	 its	 mass.	 A
planet	too	close	to	the	Sun,	such	as	Venus,	cannot	have	liquid	water	because	it	is	too
hot,	while	the	Moon’s	gravity	is	too	low	to	hold	any	kind	of	gas	(including	water	vapor,
if	 it	 was	 ever	 present).	 Mars	 may	 have	 had	 abundant	 water	 in	 its	 distant,	 warmer
past,	 but	 this	 water	 is	 now	 locked	 into	 polar	 caps,	 where	 it	 sublimates	 rather	 than
melts	and	is	eventually	lost	to	space	as	a	result	of	low	gravity	and	decomposition	by
ultraviolet	 light.	 The	 gas	 giants	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 have	 atmospheres	 composed
mainly	 of	 hydrogen	 and	 helium.	 Methane,	 water,	 hydrogen	 sulfide,	 ammonia,	 and
nitrogen	are	also	present,	making	their	atmospheric	chemistry	a	potentially	interesting
one.	 Not	 enough	 of	 this	 chemistry	 is	 known,	 including	 temperature	 gradients	 in	 the
atmospheres	 of	 these	 gas	 giants,	 to	 preclude	 the	 existence	 of	 life,	 or	 precursors
thereof,	or	to	disprove	it.

itself	 and	 the	 age	 of	 the	 star.	 Old,	 first-generation	 stars	 may	 not	 have	 any

for	planets	to	form	and	life	to	appear.	Stars	with	masses	close	to	that	of	the	Sun	or

CONCLUSIONS
At	its	beginning,	the	universe	was	a	very	small	object,	much	smaller	than
the	 size	 of	 a	 single	 proton.	 This	 object,	 however,	 contained	 an	 enormous	 amount	 of
energy.	 Possibly	 through	 a	 quantum	 fluctuation	 allowed	 by	 the	 uncertainty	 principle,
this	object	inflated	at	tremendous	velocity	for	a	very	small	fraction	of	a	second,	during
which	 all	 four	 forces	 of	 nature	 appeared.	 Following	 this	 rapid	 inflation,	 the	 rate	 of
expansion	 decreased	 and	 subatomic	 particles	 were	 created,	 as	 soon	 as	 the
decreasing	temperature	of	the	nascent	universe	allowed	it.	Protons	(hydrogen	nuclei)
stabilized	1/100,000	of	a	second	after	the	Big	Bang,	and	at	100	seconds,	the	nuclei
of	 the	 second	 element	 made	 in	 the	 Big	 Bang,	 helium,	 stabilized.	 It	 took	 an	 extra
400,000	years	for	matter	to	cease	to	exist	as	a	plasma,	the	time	at	which	electrons
were	captured	by	atomic	nuclei.	By	then	the	radius	of	the	universe	had	reached	about
1/100,000	of	its	present	size.
Clouds	of	primeval	hydrogen	and	helium	condensed	into	stars	perhaps	as	early	as
100	million	years	after	the	Big	Bang,	and	stars	started	synthesizing	all	other	elements
found	 today	 in	 the	 universe.	 The	 Sun,	 a	 second-generation	 star	 originating	 from
reprocessed	 supernova	 debris,	 formed	 about	 9	 billion	 years	 after	 the	 Big	 Bang,	 and
its	 protoplanetary	 disc	 then	 started	 accreting	 into	 planets	 and	 their	 satellites.
Atmospheres	 were	 generated	 through	 hot	 (at	 least	 plastic,	 perhaps	 liquid)	 planet
degassing	in	the	case	of	planetary	bodies	close	enough	to	their	star.	At	the	end	of	the
heavy	bombardment	period,	about	3.8	billion	years	ago,	Earth	was	ready	for	life.	But
first,	 to	 understand	 the	 past,	 we	 must	 study	 the	 present	 and	 know	 what	 life	 is	 and
how	 it	 works.	 It	 is	 now	 time	 to	 leave	 the	 realm	 of	 physics	 and	 cosmology	 and	 enter
that	of	biology.

s	we	saw	in	chapter	2,	Earth’s	atmosphere	4	billion	years	ago	was
very	different	from	the	one	we	know	today.	There	was	no	oxygen,
but	 other	 gases	 were	 present.	 In	 one	 scenario,	 these	 were
methane	 (CH4),	 water	 vapor	 (H2O),	 nitrogen	 (N2),	 ammonia	 (NH3),	 hydrogen	 sulfide
(H2S),	 and	 carbon	 dioxide	 (CO2).	 Primeval	 hydrogen	 (H2)	 and	 helium	 (He)	 were
disappearing	fast	because	Earth’s	gravity	was	not	strong	enough	to	keep	them	in	the
atmosphere.	 Traces	 of	 helium	 would	 always	 be	 present,	 however,	 thanks	 to	 the
radioactive	 decay	 of	 elements,	 such	 as	 uranium,	 thorium,	 and	 radium,	 in	 Earth’s
interior.	 There	 were	 also	 oceans,	 whose	 geography	 we	 would	 not	 recognize	 today,
since	 plate	 tectonics	 has	 moved	 the	 continents	 around.	 Volcanic	 activity	 contributed
water,	nitrogen,	carbon	dioxide,	sulfur	dioxide,	and	other	gases	to	the	atmosphere.
The	 sight	 must	 have	 been	 awesome:	 the	 sky	 was	 red	 and	 the	 Sun	 looked	 bluish
because	 nitrogen,	 which	 scatters	 blue	 light,	 was	 not	 yet	 the	 dominant	 gas	 in	 the
atmosphere.	 The	 atmospheric	 pressure	 was	 ten	 times	 higher	 than	 it	 is	 today.	 There
was	 of	 course	 no	 life	 but	 there	 was	 movement;	 the	 wind	 blew	 clouds	 and	 volcanic
smoke	around	while	the	waves	lapped	at	beaches	made	of	solid	rock,	not	yet	sand.
High	 tides	 took	 place	 every	 three	 hours	 and	 the	 Moon	 appeared	 four	 times	 closer
than	 today.	 The	 temperature	 was	 much	 higher	 than	 now,	 perhaps	 as	 high	 as	 90°C,

dioxide.	 Nevertheless,	 this	 temperature	 was	 low	 enough	 for	 liquid	 water	 to	 exist.	 In
the	absence	of	oxygen,	there	was	no	ozone	(O3)	layer	and	Earth	was	bombarded	by
hard	ultraviolet	(UV)	radiation	from	the	Sun.
Scientists	 have	 gained	 much	 information	 concerning	 Earth’s	 primitive	 atmosphere
by	 studying	 our	 sister	 planet,	 Venus,	 whose	 atmosphere	 contains	 huge	 amounts	 of
carbon	 dioxide	 (96	 percent),	 some	 nitrogen	 (3	 percent),	 and	 some	 sulfur	 dioxide
(SO2),	 but	 no	 oxygen.	 However,	 being	 closer	 to	 the	 Sun,	 Venus	 receives	 twice	 as
much	 radiation	 and	 heat,	 which,	 combined	 with	 the	 enormous	 greenhouse	 effect
caused	by	the	vast	amount	of	CO2,	raises	the	surface	temperature	to	460°C.	This	is
where	the	parallels	between	Venus	and	Earth	stop:	liquid	water	cannot	exist	on	Venus
because	 it	 is	 too	 hot,	 so	 life	 is	 impossible	 on	 that	 planet.	 Mars	 has	 the	 opposite
problem:	being	farther	from	the	Sun,	it	is	too	cold	for	liquid	water	to	exist.	However,
its	present	tenuous	atmosphere	is	very	much	like	Venus’s,	without	the	sulfur	dioxide.
Conceivably,	Venus	and	Earth	originally	had	similar	atmospheres,	composed	of,	in
order	of	decreasing	abundance,	H2,	He,	CH4,	H2O,	N2,	NH3,	and	H2S.	What	happened
to	 these	 gases	 on	 these	 planets?	 Today,	 Earth’s	 atmosphere	 is	 composed	 of	 about
79	 percent	 nitrogen,	 21	 percent	 oxygen,	 and	 low	 amounts	 of	 a	 few	 other	 gases.
Venus	 also	 lost	 many	 of	 its	 original	 gases.	 As	 we	 have	 seen,	 H2	 and	 He	 quickly
escaped	 into	 space.	 The	 fate	 of	 the	 other	 gases	 (except	 N2)	 was	 sealed	 by	 the	 UV
radiation	 from	 the	 Sun,	 which	 decomposed	 them	 through	 the	 phenomenon	 known	 as
photolysis.	 On	 Venus,	 where	 liquid	 water	 did	 not	 exist,	 water	 vapor	 was	 quickly
decomposed	into	hydrogen	(which	escaped)	and	free	oxygen,	which	rapidly	oxidized
CH4	and	H2S	to	CO2	and	SO2.	The	oxidation	of	NH3	simply	produced	more	N2.
On	 Earth,	 where	 liquid	 water	 did	 exist,	 H2O	 photolysis	 was	 not	 nearly	 as
pronounced	because	UV-induced	water	decomposition	occurs	best	in	the	gas	phase.
Nevertheless,	 photolysis	 of	 the	 primeval	 gases	 did	 take	 place,	 albeit	 more	 slowly,
because	 Earth	 is	 farther	 from	 the	 Sun.	 Thus	 CH4,	 NH3,	 and	 H2S	 also	 gradually
disappeared.	 There	 was	 one	 enormous	 difference	 between	 Earth	 and	 Venus,
however:	 thanks	 to	 the	 presence	 of	 liquid	 water,	 the	 CO2	 and	 SO2	 generated	 by
photolysis	 dissolved	 in	 the	 oceans,	 reacted	 with	 the	 minerals	 present	 there,	 and
became	locked	in	rocks.	This	prevented	the	runaway	greenhouse	effect	that	occurred
on	Venus	and	made	nitrogen	the	dominant	gas.	After	a	few	hundred	million	years,	the
sky	finally	turned	blue.	Before	this	happened—that	is,	while	Earth’s	atmosphere	was
still	 reducing	 (still	 containing	 appreciable	 amounts	 of	 H2,	 CH4,	 and	 NH3)—could	 it	 be
that	 some	 of	 the	 building	 blocks	 of	 life	 were	 somehow	 assembled	 in	 the	 primeval
gases?	After	all,	Earth’s	crust	and	the	oceans	at	that	time	could	not	have	held	much
in	 terms	 of	 carbon-	 and	 nitrogen-containing	 compounds	 that	 make	 up	 living	 cells.
Some	scientists	do	indeed	think	that	the	first	building	blocks	of	life	were	synthesized
via	atmospheric	chemistry.

PRIMITIVE	ATMOSPHERE

Copyright   2003. Columbia University Press. All rights reserved.

In	 1953,	 Stanley	 Miller,	 working	 in	 the	 laboratory	 of	 Harold	 Urey	 (the
Nobel	laureate	who	discovered	deuterium)	at	the	University	of	Chicago,	published	the
results	 of	 a	 strange	 experiment	 that	 was	 based	 on	 the	 assumption	 that	 Earth’s
atmosphere	 was	 once	 a	 reducing	 one.	 In	 a	 reducing	 atmosphere,	 free	 oxygen	 does
not	 exist,	 and	 elements	 are	 present	 in	 a	 reduced,	 hydrogenated	 form	 such	 as	 CH4,
H2O,	and	NH3,	and,	of	course,	H2.	Miller	knew	that	the	Russian	Alexander	Oparin	and
the	 British	 J.	 B.	 S.	 Haldane	 had	 suggested	 several	 decades	 earlier	 that	 a	 reducing
atmosphere	 could	 have	 allowed	 the	 synthesis	 of	 organic	 compounds	 (composed	 of
carbon,	 hydrogen,	 nitrogen,	 and	 a	 few	 other	 elements)	 necessary	 for	 life	 to	 appear.
However,	 they	 never	 did	 any	 experiments	 to	 test	 that	 idea.	 Miller,	 then	 a	 graduate
student,	 decided	 to	 test	 this	 hypothesis,	 apparently	 with	 only	 reluctant	 support	 from
his	boss,	Urey	(who	did	not	coauthor	the	article).
Miller	built	an	apparatus	(figure	4.1),	made	of	glass,	into	which	he	introduced	liquid
water,	 hydrogen,	 methane,	 and	 ammonia	 gases.	 (The	 air	 had	 previously	 been
pumped	out	of	the	system	to	eliminate	oxygen.)	To	produce	water	vapor,	Miller	boiled
water	 held	 in	 a	 flask;	 this	 had	 the	 further	 effect	 of	 circulating	 the	 mixture	 of	 gases
present	 in	 the	 apparatus.	 To	 simulate	 rain,	 Miller	 added	 a	 cooled	 condenser	 to	 the
system	and	trapped	the	condensed	water	in	a	U-shaped	tube.	The	condensed	water
thus	represented	the	primitive	ocean.	Samples	from	this	tube	could	be	harvested	and
analyzed	 for	 any	 water-soluble	 molecules	 that	 formed.	 Finally,	 the	 apparatus
contained	another	large	glass	flask,	in	which	the	gases	circulated,	and	which	housed
two	metal	electrodes	that	allowed	electrical	sparking	of	the	gas	mixture.	The	electric
discharge	 simulated	 the	 lightning	 that	 undoubtedly	 must	 have	 occurred	 in	 the
atmosphere	 (the	 atmosphere	 of	 Jupiter	 is	 witness	 to	 huge	 lightning	 discharges	 and
contains	all	the	gases	used	by	Miller).

FIGURE	 4.1	 Schematic	 representation	 of	 the	 equipment	 used	 by	 Stanley	 Miller	 to	 produce	 organic
molecules	under	abiotic	conditions.	The	air	from	the	glass	apparatus	is	first	evacuated	by	pumping.	Water	and	the
gases	hydrogen,	methane,	and	ammonia	are	then	added	to	the	flask	at	the	lower	left.	Water	is	brought	to	a	boil	and
water	vapor	starts	circulating	(black	dots)	in	the	apparatus.	Water	vapor	and	the	three	other	gases	then	fill	the	large
glass	 chamber	 at	 upper	 right.	 The	 chamber	 is	 equipped	 with	 two	 electrodes	 connected	 to	 a	 power	 source,	 and
sparking	is	initiated.	Water	vapor	and	compounds	resulting	from	the	action	of	sparking	are	then	condensed	by	the
cooling	system	and	accumulate	in	the	trap.	Compounds	harvested	from	the	trap	are	then	analyzed	chemically.

After	 several	 days	 of	 cycling	 the	 gases	 and	 sparking,	 Miller	 noticed	 that	 the
condensed	 water	 in	 the	 tube	 had	 turned	 pink	 and	 subsequently	 orange-red.	 Clearly,
some	 chemistry	 was	 taking	 place,	 as	 the	 original	 gases	 were	 completely	 colorless.
Analysis	 of	 the	 solution	 revealed	 the	 presence	 of	 amino	 acids,	 the	 building	 blocks	 of
proteins!	 Of	 the	 twenty	 amino	 acids	 found	 in	 proteins,	 ten	 were	 formed	 in	 Miller’s
experiments.	The	chemistry	that	took	place	in	these	experiments	is	now	understood.
For	 example,	 the	 simple	 amino	 acid	 glycine	 results	 from	 the	 condensation	 of

formaldehyde	(formed	from	the	sparked	gases)	with	ammonia	and	hydrogen	cyanide
(also	 formed	 in	 the	 gas	 mixture)	 to	 produce	 the	 compound	 aminonitrile.	 Aminonitrile
then	reacts	with	water	to	form	glycine	(figure	4.2).
In	addition	to	amino	acids	that	make	up	proteins,	gas-discharge	experiments	have
also	yielded	the	four	nitrogenous	bases,	adenine	(A),	cytosine	(C),	guanine	(G),	and
uracil	 (U),	 the	 building	 blocks	 of	 RNA.	 Adenine	 for	 example,	 results	 from	 the
condensation	 of	 five	 molecules	 of	 hydrogen	 cyanide	 (figure	 4.3).	 (It	 is	 unsettling	 to
think	 that	 the	 poison	 used	 to	 execute	 prisoners	 in	 a	 gas	 chamber	 can	 lead	 to	 the
synthesis	 of	 some	 of	 the	 building	 blocks	 of	 life!)	 Finally,	 many	 types	 of	 sugars	 were
also	 synthesized	 in	 these	 experiments,	 including	 ribose,	 the	 sugar	 found	 in	 RNA.
These	sugars	are	made	through	polymerization	of	formaldehyde,	itself	formed	in	the
sparked	gases.	However,	ribose	is	made	in	small	amounts,	and	it	is	unclear	how	it,	as
opposed	 to	 all	 other	 sugars,	 came	 to	 form	 RNA.	 We	 will	 see	 a	 possible	 answer	 to
this	problem	later	in	the	chapter.
The	 startling	 results	 of	 Miller’s	 experiments	 have	 led	 to	 the	 notion	 that	 Earth’s
primitive	 oceans	 accumulated	 more	 and	 more	 of	 the	 building	 blocks	 of	 life,	 amino
acids,	 nitrogenous	 bases,	 and	 sugars,	 and	 became	 some	 sort	 of	 primordial	 or
prebiotic	 soup.	 (Instead	 of	 the	 term	 soup,	 which	 suggests	 a	 chunky	 mixture—think
about	 split	 pea	 with	 ham	 or	 chicken	 noodle	 soup!—I	 prefer	 the	 word	 broth.)
Primordial	broths	of	the	Miller	type	have	been	replicated	by	many	investigators	using
similar	 gas	 mixtures	 exposed	 to	 short-wave	 UV	 light	 or	 silent	 electric	 discharge,	 all
undoubtedly	present	on	primitive	Earth.
Interestingly,	 free	 oxygen	 completely	 interfered	 with	 all	 the	 reactions	 just
described.	Since	we	know	that	the	oldest	rocks	found	on	Earth	are	not	oxidized,	this
supports	 the	 conclusion	 that,	 indeed,	 oxygen	 was	 not	 present	 in	 the	 primeval
atmosphere	 and	 could	 not	 have	 blocked	 the	 chemical	 reactions	 observed	 by	 Miller
and	others.	Thus	the	problem	seemed	solved:	the	building	blocks	of	proteins	and	RNA
(but	 not	 DNA,	 as	 thymine	 was	 not	 formed	 in	 these	 reactions)	 were	 made	 in	 Earth’s
reducing	atmosphere.1	But	was	the	problem	really	solved?	Perhaps	not.

There	 are	 indeed	 difficulties	 with	 Miller’s	 experiments.	 First,	 most	 scientists	 now
concur	 that	 Earth’s	 atmosphere	 did	 not	 contain	 significant	 amounts	 of	 hydrogen,
methane,	 and	 ammonia	 for	 the	 length	 of	 time	 sufficient	 to	 allow	 the	 formation	 of	 a

vapor	and	unreactive	gases	such	as	argon	and	neon),	much	like	the	atmospheres	of
Venus	and	Mars	today.	Indeed,	it	is	argued	that	Earth’s	primeval	atmosphere	(as	well
as	those	of	Venus	and	Mars)	was	blown	off	as	our	Sun	ignited.	Another	contributing
factor	 would	 have	 been	 the	 violent	 collision	 between	 young	 Earth	 and	 a	 Mars-sized
object	 that	 became	 the	 Moon.	 A	 new	 atmosphere	 could	 then	 have	 been	 generated
through	 volcanic	 activity.	 It	 turns	 out	 that	 volcanoes	 emit	 mostly	 water	 vapor,	 carbon
dioxide,	and	nitrogen,	together	with	small	amounts	of	carbon	monoxide	and	hydrogen.
No	 ammonia	 and	 methane	 are	 emitted	 by	 modern	 volcanoes.	 Therefore	 Earth’s
primitive	atmosphere	may	have	been	much	less	reducing	than	imagined	by	Miller.

numbers	and	yields,	are	produced.	Thus	a	strongly	reducing	atmosphere	is	necessary
to	 produce	 the	 whole	 variety	 and	 large	 amounts	 of	 organic	 compounds	 found	 in	 a
Miller-type	 of	 experiment.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 nucleic	 acid	 base	 uracil	 could	 be
produced	 by	 sparking	 mixtures	 of	 methane	 and	 nitrogen.	 Where	 was	 this	 methane
coming	 from	 if	 it	 did	 not	 exist	 in	 the	 primeval	 atmosphere?	 It	 could	 have	 come	 from
hydrothermal	vents	found	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	or	it	could	have	been	delivered
by	cometary	impacts	(see	later).	HCN,	so	crucial	as	an	intermediate	in	the	synthesis
of	 amino	 acids	 and	 bases,	 could	 have	 originated	 from	 the	 reaction	 of	 methane	 with
nitrogen	to	produce	it	and	hydrogen.	This	reaction	could	have	been	catalyzed	by	UV
light	 from	 the	 Sun.	 Hydrogen	 produced	 by	 this	 reaction,	 plus	 hydrogen	 emitted	 by
volcanoes,	 would	 have	 made	 Earth’s	 atmosphere	 mildly	 reducing.	 In	 conclusion,	 the
atmosphere	 was	 probably	 not	 as	 reducing	 as	 Miller	 thought,	 but	 reduced	 carbon	 in
the	form	of	CH4	as	well	as	H2	gas	were	probably	present	in	modest	amounts.
It	 was	 discovered	 in	 the	 early	 1960s	 that	 simple	 mixtures	 of	 ammonia	 and
hydrogen	cyanide	in	water	also	form	amino	acids	and	large	amounts	of	adenine.	This
suggested	 that	 bringing	 these	 three	 chemicals	 together	 somewhere,	 and	 not
necessarily	on	Earth,	could	produce	some	of	the	building	blocks	of	life.	At	about	the
same	time,	amino	acids,	as	well	as	the	bases	adenine	and	guanine,	were	detected	in
meteorites.1	 Meteorites	 derive	 mostly	 from	 asteroids	 present	 between	 the	 orbits	 of
Mars	 and	 Jupiter	 (some	 rare	 ones	 are	 of	 lunar	 or	 Martian	 origin).	 These	 meteorites
were	 never	 exposed	 to	 any	 kind	 of	 atmosphere,	 reducing	 or	 oxidizing.	 How	 then	 do
they	 contain	 organic	 compounds?	 These	 compounds	 would	 have	 had	 to	 have	 been
made	 in	 space,	 possibly	 as	 a	 result	 of	 reactions	 between	 water,	 hydrogen	 cyanide,
methane,	and	ammonia.	Do	these	chemicals	actually	exist	in	space?	Yes,	they	do.

SPACE	CHEMISTRY	AND	THE	ORIGINS	OF	LIFE
We	saw	in	chapter	2	that,	indeed,	large	interstellar	clouds	in	which	stars
and	 planets	 are	 formed	 do	 contain	 these	 molecules,	 plus	 many	 others.	 Water	 ice	 is
thought	 to	 be	 the	 most	 common	 solid	 in	 the	 universe,	 and	 even	 methanol	 (CH3OH;
wood	 alcohol)	 and	 ethanol	 (C2H5OH;	 drinking	 alcohol)	 exist	 in	 deep	 space!	 What	 is
more,	these	clouds	also	contain	cyanoacetylene	(HC3N),	 a	 chemical	 that	 reacts	 with
hydrogen	cyanide	to	form	nitrogenous	bases	found	in	RNA.	Thus	gases	and	particles
left	 over	 from	 the	 protoplanetary	 disc	 after	 its	 condensation	 into	 planets	 could	 have
delivered	 significant	 amounts	 of	 organic	 materials	 to	 Earth’s	 surface	 in	 the	 form	 of
meteorites	and	comets.
Comets	 in	 particular	 are	 thought	 to	 be	 aggregates	 of	 primordial	 material	 much
predating	 the	 formation	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 we	 know	 it	 today.	 They	 are	 found	 in
two	 systems	 orbiting	 the	 Sun.	 The	 first	 system	 is	 called	 the	 Kuyper	 belt	 and	 its
members	orbit	the	Sun	between	the	orbits	of	Neptune	and	Pluto.	The	second	system,
called	 the	 Oort	 cloud,	 forms	 a	 halo,	 well	 beyond	 the	 orbit	 of	 Pluto,	 around	 the	 solar
system.	Once	in	a	while,	a	comet	is	knocked	off	its	orbit	because	of	the	gravitational

effect	of	the	planets	or	a	passing	star.	The	comet	then	has	a	chance	to	approach	the
Sun	 at	 a	 much	 closer	 distance,	 with	 the	 result	 that	 some	 of	 its	 material	 evaporates
and	forms	a	visible	tail.	The	tail	can	be	studied	and	its	spectrum	recorded,	either	from
Earth	 or	 from	 spacecraft	 on	 a	 rendezvous	 mission.	 Results	 of	 all	 studies	 agree	 that
comets	 are	 rich	 in	 organic	 material	 and	 water.	 Comet	 Halley	 was	 even	 shown	 to
contain	 the	 bases	 found	 in	 RNA	 and	 DNA.	 Comets	 visible	 from	 Earth	 are	 not	 that
frequent	today,	but	they	may	have	been	much	more	prevalent	in	the	vicinity	of	Earth	a
few	billion	years	ago	when	the	solar	system	was	forming.	Collisions	with	young	Earth
may	 have	 been	 frequent	 and	 would	 have	 resulted	 in	 the	 seeding	 of	 the	 planet	 with
building	blocks	of	life	or	their	precursors.
Similarly,	 meteorites,	 some	 of	 which	 contain	 organic	 compounds,	 as	 we	 have
seen,	 still	 collide	 with	 Earth	 today	 and	 may	 have	 played	 the	 same	 role.	 It	 is	 known
that	 planet	 Earth	 accumulates	 about	 100	 tons	 per	 day	 of	 meteoritic	 material	 in	 the
form	of	micrometeorites.	These	micrometeorites	measure	about	0.1	mm	in	diameter
and	are	carbon	rich	(up	to	7	percent	by	weight).	Micrometeorite	samples	have	been
collected	in	the	“clean”	environment	of	antarctic	ice	and	have	been	shown	to	contain
detectable	 amounts	 of	 organic	 molecules.	 It	 is	 quite	 possible	 that	 prebiotic	 Earth
accumulated	 vast	 amounts	 of	 carbon-containing	 compounds	 by	 sweeping	 up
micrometeoritic	material.
If	comets	and	meteorites	and	their	cohort	of	organic	molecules	truly	originate	from
primeval	 interstellar	 clouds	 (at	 a	 further	 stage	 of	 processing	 in	 the	 case	 of
meteorites),	 these	 clouds	 should	 also	 contain	 molecules	 found	 in	 comets	 and
meteorites.	Astronomical	observations	have	shown	that	this	is	the	case.	These	clouds
contain,	in	addition	to	gases,	solid	material	in	the	form	of	dust.	Their	spectra	indicate
that	this	dust	is	made	of	microscopic	silicate	granules	covered	with	ice	composed	of
water,	 methanol,	 methane,	 carbon	 monoxide,	 carbon	 dioxide,	 and	 a	 class	 of	 organic
molecules	called	 polycyclic	aromatic	 hydrocarbons.	Given	 that	interstellar	 clouds	are
constantly	 bathed	 in	 UV	 light	 emitted	 by	 nearby	 stars,	 the	 potential	 for	 interstellar
chemistry	is	great.
Interstellar	 ice	 analogues	 have	 been	 created	 in	 the	 laboratory:	 the	 compounds
known	to	exist	in	interstellar	clouds	were	sprayed	in	a	vacuum	chamber	kept	at	very
low	 temperature	 to	 simulate	 conditions	 found	 in	 space.	 The	 ice	 grains	 thus	 formed
were	illuminated	with	UV	light	to	mimic	starlight.	Analysis	of	these	ices	revealed	that
complex	 organic	 molecules	 could	 be	 formed,	 including	 quinones	 (electron	 transfer
intermediates	 in	 photosynthesis),	 amino	 acids,	 and	 long-chain	 hydrocarbons	 with
properties	 similar	 to	 amphiphilic	 lipids	 found	 in	 the	 membranes	 of	 living	 cells	 (see
chapter	 3).	 These	 amphiphilic	 hydrocarbons	 are	 able	 to	 form	 microscopic	 vesicles,
presumably	 through	 bilayer	 formation,	 when	 dispersed	 in	 water.	 Intriguingly,	 similar
compounds	are	found	in	some	meteorites	and	they,	too,	form	these	vesicles	in	water.
Such	vesicles	are	able	to	trap	a	variety	of	chemicals,	and	by	keeping	these	chemicals
in	 close	 contact,	 they	 may	 have	 initiated	 some	 of	 the	 chemical	 reactions	 that	 led	 to
life.	Interestingly,	amphiphilic	hydrocarbons	are	not	formed	in	Miller-type	experiments.
In	 conclusion,	 space	 contains	 a	 host	 of	 organic	 molecules	 able	 to	 generate,	 through

chemical	 reactions,	 some	 compounds	 necessary	 for	 life	 to	 appear.	 Furthermore,
space	 chemistry	 seems	 able	 to	 produce	 molecules	 not	 found	 in	 gases	 submitted	 to
electric	discharges.
Another	objection	to	Miller’s	experiments	is	based	on	the	chirality	of	the	molecules
he	 produced	 in	 his	 sparked	 gases.	 Chirality,	 also	 called	 handedness,	 refers	 to	 the
three-dimensional	arrangement	of	atoms	in	a	molecule.	A	good	analogy	is	that	of	the
symmetry	of	human	hands,	hence	the	word	handedness.	The	left	hand	and	the	right
hand	are	directly	superimposable	when	pressed	palm	to	palm.	They	are	not	perfectly
superimposable	 when	 pressed	 palm	 to	 knuckles.	 To	 achieve	 palm-to-palm	 contact,
one	of	our	hands	must	be	rotated,	or	a	single	hand	can	be	directly	superimposed	with
its	 mirror	 image.	 The	 same	 thing	 happens	 in	 nature:	 amino	 acids	 come	 in	 two
varieties,	 left-handed	 and	 right-handed,	 which	 can	 be	 distinguished	 by	 their	 ability	 to
rotate	 polarized	 light	 either	 to	 the	 left	 or	 to	 the	 right.	 It	 turns	 out	 that	 amino	 acids	 in
living	 cells	 belong	 to	 the	 left-handed	 category.	 One	 of	 the	 criticisms	 of	 Miller-type
experiments	 is	 that	 they	 produce	 equal	 amounts	 of	 left-handed	 and	 right-handed
amino	acids,	something	not	found	in	living	systems.	In	contrast,	amino	acids	found	in
meteorites	contain	slightly	more	left-handed	amino	acids	than	right-handed	ones.	This
does	 not	 prove	 that	 life	 originated	 from	 meteorites,	 but	 it	 certainly	 does	 not	 rule	 out
this	notion.
Thus	 space	 itself,	 not	 necessarily	 Earth	 and	 its	 primitive	 atmosphere,	 may	 have
been	responsible	for	the	synthesis	of	the	building	blocks	of	life.	Or	was	it?

OCEAN	FLOOR	CHEMISTRY
As	we	saw	in	the	introduction	to	this	book,	science	constantly	questions
and	 requestions	 received	 knowledge.	 That	 some	 scientists	 think	 that	 organic
compounds	 important	 for	 life	 were	 formed	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 or	 were	 brought	 to
Earth	by	comets	and	meteorites	does	not	make	it	so.	Other	hypotheses	can	always
be	formulated.	A	third	hypothesis,	which	holds	that	the	first	organic	compounds	were
made	 on	 Earth	 rather	 than	 in	 space	 or	 in	 the	 atmosphere,	 is	 the	 hydrothermal	 vents
hypothesis.
Earth’s	crust	is	particularly	thin	at	the	level	of	ocean	floors.	There,	tectonic	plates
slowly	 slide	 on	 top	 of	 the	 magma	 and	 by	 doing	 so,	 create	 ridges	 and	 cracks	 in	 the
crust.	Water	percolates	through	these	cracks,	becomes	superheated	by	contact	with
the	 magma,	 and	 dissolves	 many	 of	 the	 minerals	 present	 there.	 The	 pressure	 is	 so
high	that	the	water,	heated	to	several	hundred	degrees,	does	not	boil	but	is	spewed
back	 through	 chimney-like	 structures	 called	 hydrothermal	 vents	 (figure	 4.4).	 These
vents	are	often	surrounded	by	miniature	ecosystems,	where	many	types	of	bacteria,

1990s	 indicated	 that,	 yes,	 this	 is	 possible.	 The	 branch	 of	 chemistry	 called
thermodynamics	 mathematically	 determines	 what	 chemical	 reactions	 are	 possible	 or
impossible.	 Using	 this	 approach,	 scientists	 realized	 that	 in	 water,	 the	 synthesis	 of	 all
amino	 acids	 and	 their	 linking	 to	 form	 small	 proteins	 was	 theoretically	 possible	 above
100°C	 and	 under	 high	 pressure.	 The	 ingredients	 needed	 to	 achieve	 this	 synthesis
were	 CO2,	 ammonia	 salts,	 and	 H2S	 (some	 amino	 acids	 contain	 sulfur).	 It	 turns	 out
that	 both	 high	 temperature	 and	 these	 particular	 chemicals	 are	 found	 in	 oceanic
hydrothermal	 vents.	 Therefore	 in	 theory,	 amino	 acids	 and	 proteins	 could	 have	 been
formed	 at	 great	 depth	 under	 the	 surface	 of	 the	 ocean.	 Of	 course,	 such	 calculations
did	 not	 prove	 that	 these	 reactions	 actually	 took	 place;	 some	 scientists	 used	 the
derogatory	 term	 paper	 chemistry	 to	 characterize	 these	 studies.	 The	 hydrothermal
vent	hypothesis	had	to	be	put	to	the	test.
This	 was	 done	 using	 an	 instrument	 called	 a	 bomb,	 which	 is	 simply	 a	 reinforced
container	 able	 to	 sustain	 high	 temperatures	 and	 pressures.	 It	 was	 shown	 that,
indeed,	a	whole	catalog	of	organic	molecules,	including	amino	acids	and	pyruvic	acid
(an	 important	 metabolite	 ubiquitous	 in	 living	 cells),	 could	 be	 formed	 at	 high	 pressure
and	 temperature	 from	 H2S,	 CO,	 and	 CO2	 as	 well	 as	 ammonia	 (from	 nitrate)	 and
nitrogenated	hydrocarbons.	Interestingly,	iron	sulfide	(FeS)	was	absolutely	necessary
to	 catalyze	 these	 reactions,	 to	 generate	 hydrogen	 for	 reduction	 reactions,	 and	 to
concentrate	and	stabilize	the	reaction	products.	This	mineral	is	abundant	in	the	earth’s
crust	in	the	form	of	pyrrhotite.	Although	the	formation	of	nitrogenous	bases	as	found
in	 RNA	 and	 DNA	 has	 not	 been	 reported,	 hydrothermal	 vent	 chemistry	 seems	 to	 be
much	more	than	just	paper	chemistry.

meteorites	colliding	with	Earth	could	not	have	survived	atmospheric	entry	and	impact
because	 of	 the	 high	 heat	 generated.	 Finally,	 high	 temperature-high	 pressure
chemistry,	 as	 is	 presumably	 taking	 place	 in	 hydrothermal	 vents,	 has	 so	 far	 not
produced	 nitrogenous	 bases	 and	 long-chain	 lipids.	 How	 can	 this	 conundrum	 be
solved?
It	is	always	possible	that	more	research	on	the	preceding	three	systems	will	yield
some	new	findings	and	solve	the	mystery.	On	the	other	hand,	it	is	also	possible	that
life	did	not	need	amino	acids,	nitrogenous	bases,	and	long-chain	lipids	all	at	the	same
time.	 One	 can	 imagine,	 for	 instance,	 a	 situation	 in	 which	 genetic	 information	 (in	 the
form	of	bases	linked	together	to	form	a	nucleic	acid)	came	first,	and	that	this	genetic
information	started	coding	for	some	form	of	primitive	metabolism.	Or	perhaps	another
scenario	 occurred,	 in	 which	 mineral	 catalysts	 or	 primitive	 enzymes,	 made	 of	 amino
acids	 synthesized	 in	 hydrothermal	 vents	 or	 elsewhere,	 started	 a	 “protometabolism”
that	eventually	led	to	the	formation	of	nucleic	acids.	In	that	case,	genetic	information
would	have	appeared	as	a	result	of	a	mineral-based	protometabolism	and,	possibly,
after	 the	 products	 it	 now	 codes	 for,	 proteins.	 Yet	 another	 possibility	 is	 that	 life
appeared	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 complicated	 cooperation	 between	 simple	 proteins	 and
simple	nucleic	acids.	Scientists	have	not	yet	developed	this	third	scenario.	Therefore
we	 will	 consider	 the	 “metabolism-first”	 world	 and	 the	 “RNA-first”	 world	 in	 that	 order,
keeping	in	mind	that	these	two	models	are	not	necessarily	incompatible.

PROTEINS	AND	METABOLISM	FIRST:	THE	IRON-SULFUR
WORLD
Two	of	the	most	prominent	proponents	of	the	idea	that	protometabolism
was	 key	 to	 the	 appearance	 of	 life	 on	 Earth	 are	 the	 Nobel	 Prize	 winner	 Christian	 de
Duve	 of	 Belgium	 and	 Günter	 Wächtershäuser	 of	 Germany.	 Some	 of	 their	 work	 is
discussed	 later.	 Both	 espouse	 the	 view	 that	 iron-	 and	 sulfur-containing	 compounds
were	 critical	 to	 the	 establishment	 of	 protometabolism	 in	 the	 prebiotic	 world	 (a	 world
still	 devoid	 of	 life	 as	 we	 know	 it	 but	 poised	 to	 see	 its	 birth).	 Such	 a	 view	 hinges	 on
two	 ideas:	 first,	 a	 source	 of	 energy	 was	 needed	 to	 make	 possible	 some	 prebiotic
chemical	 reactions,	 and	 second,	 the	 formation	 of	 proteins	 may	 have	 happened
spontaneously.
As	 we	 saw	 in	 chapter	 3,	 a	 great	 number	 of	 chemical	 reactions	 taking	 place	 in
living	 cells	 require	 an	 energy	 supply	 in	 the	 form	 of	 ATP,	 a	 combination	 of	 adenine,
ribose,	 and	 three	 phosphate	 groups.	 Before	 life	 existed,	 there	 was	 no	 abundant
source	 of	 ATP.	 What	 could	 possibly	 have	 been	 the	 source	 of	 energy	 that	 drove
prebiotic	 reactions	 in	 the	 primeval	 broth?	 In	 addition,	 assuming	 that	 the	 primitive
Earth’s	 atmosphere	 was	 not	 as	 reducing	 as	 thought	 by	 others,	 but	 that	 it	 contained
carbon,	mostly	in	the	form	of	CO	or	CO2	(but	not	CH4),	and	no	longer	any	hydrogen,
how	could	hydrogenated	(reduced)	forms	of	carbon	be	produced?	It	is	indeed	mostly
reduced	 carbon	 that	 is	 present	 in	 biological	 molecules.	 A	 possible	 answer	 lies	 in	 a

combination	 of	 the	 effects	 of	 UV	 light	 from	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 presence	 of	 iron	 on
Earth’s	 surface.	 This	 is	 how	 things	 may	 have	 worked	 according	 to	 de	 Duve.	 Not
surprisingly,	his	model	is	based	on	oxidation-reduction	reactions.
Iron,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 oxides	 and	 salts,	 is	 a	 very	 common	 element	 on	 Earth.	 When
chemically	combined	with	other	elements,	iron	becomes	ionized	(electrically	charged)
and	its	ions	can	either	be	doubly	positively	charged	(Fe2+)	or	triply	positively	charged
(Fe3+).	Fe2+	is	the	reduced	form	of	iron,	whereas	Fe3+	is	its	oxidized	form.	Both	forms
currently	 exist	 naturally	 on	 Earth	 and	 must	 have	 existed	 in	 the	 distant	 past	 as	 well.
Reduced	iron	is	soluble	in	water,	whereas	oxidized	iron	combined	with	oxygen	is	not.
Thus	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 oxygen,	 prebiotic	 Earth’s	 waters	 must	 have	 contained
significant	 amounts	 of	 reduced	 iron	 dissolved	 in	 water.	 Furthermore,	 water	 (H2O)
always	 contains	 a	 certain	 amount	 of	 protons	 (H+)	 and	 hydroxyl	 radicals	 (OH').
Remembering	 that	 oxidation-reduction	 reactions	 are	 accompanied	 by	 electron
transfer	(see	chapter	3),	it	is	easy	to	understand	how	the	oxidation	of	iron	may	have
powered	some	important	chemical	reactions	on	prebiotic	Earth.
It	turns	out	that	under	the	influence	of	UV	light	(provided	by	the	Sun),	the	Fe2+	ions
can	 react	 with	 the	 protons	 present	 in	 water	 to	 form	 Fe3+	 ions	 and	 hydrogen	 gas.	 In
this	 reaction,	 reduced	 Fe2+	 donates	 an	 electron	 to	 each	 proton	 (H+)	 to	 give	 Fe3+	 (an
additional	positive	charge	is	gained	because	an	electron	is	lost)	and	an	H	atom.	Two
H	 atoms	 quickly	 combine	 to	 give	 hydrogen	 gas,	 H2,	 which	 escapes	 into	 the
atmosphere.	The	Fe3+	so	generated	then	reacts	with	water	to	give	iron	oxide,	which
precipitates	 out	 of	 solution	 as	 a	 black	 material.	 Thus	 iron	 is	 oxidized	 in	 this	 process
while	 protons	 are	 reduced	 to	 hydrogen	 gas	 (figure	 4.5).	 This	 hydrogen	 may	 have
rendered	the	atmosphere	more	reducing.

FIGURE	4.5	How	the	oxidation	of	iron	ions	in	water	irradiated	by	ultraviolet	(UV)	light	produces	hydrogen
gas	that	escapes	into	the	atmosphere.	In	this	process,	reduced	iron	Fe2+	is	oxidized	into	Fe3+,	which	reacts	with
water	to	produce	insoluble	magnetite.	The	electrons	lost	by	Fe2+	in	the	oxidation	reaction	are	captured	by	H+	ions,
always	present	in	water,	to	give	neutral	hydrogen	atoms	that	quickly	combine	to	make	molecular	hydrogen	gas,	H2.

Furthermore,	 and	 again	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 UV	 light,	 iron	 ions	 could	 possibly
have	 cycled	 back	 and	 forth	 between	 a	 reduced	 and	 an	 oxidized	 state	 while	 reacting

In	 addition,	 some	 of	 the	 newly	 formed	 ══CH2	 compounds	 could	 have	 spontaneously

other	reactions.	This	mechanism	is	called	the	iron	cycle	(figure	4.6).
Thus	 iron	 chemistry	 allows	 for	 the	 formation	 of	 reduced	 carbon	 compounds,
including	 methane,	 hydrogen,	 and	 possibly	 other	 reduced	 chemicals	 such	 as
ammonia,	 hydrogen	 cyanide,	 and	 hydrogen	 sulfide.	 It	 also	 produces	 energy	 in	 the
absence	 of	 ATP.	 This	 scenario	 shows	 that	 a	 native	 and	 strongly	 reducing	 primitive
atmosphere	 may	 not	 have	 been	 needed;	 the	 iron	 cycle	 produced	 the	 necessary
reduced	 ingredients	 in	 solution	 and	 these	 could	 have	 combined	 to	 form	 amino	 acids
and	 nitrogenous	 bases	 to	 make	 up	 the	 prebiotic	 broth.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 if	 the
primitive	 atmosphere	 was	 reducing,	 the	 iron	 cycle	 could	 have	 provided	 energy	 to
achieve	reactions	involving	precursor	compounds	made	in	the	atmosphere.	Therefore
the	 iron	 cycle	 and	 the	 formation	 of	 organic	 molecules	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 may	 have
been	synergistic.
Let	us	now	examine	how	the	iron	cycle	and	its	energy	production	could	have	been
taken	 over	 by	 reactions	 that	 approximate	 living	 mechanisms	 (which	 the	 iron	 cycle
does	not).	We	saw	in	chapter	3	that	the	universal	energy	donor	in	living	cells	is	ATP.
Remember	 that	 it	 is	 the	 cleavage	 of	 one	 or	 two	 phosphate	 groups	 from	 ATP	 that
generates	 energy	 usable	 by	 other	 reactions.	 Could	 the	 prebiotic	 broth	 have	 stored
energy	in	compounds	containing	phosphorus	but	no	adenine	and	no	ribose	(assuming
these	 two	 were	 either	 absent	 or	 present	 in	 very	 low	 concentrations)?	 Yes,	 and	 the
following	reactions	explain	how.
We	must	first	assume	that	a	class	of	molecules	called	carboxylic	acids	existed	in
the	prebiotic	broth.	These	organic	acids	have	the	general	formula	R—COOH,	where
R	 is	 a	 group	 that	 may	 be	 simply	 a	 hydrogen	 atom,	 or	 it	 may	 be	 a	 methyl	 group	 (—
CH3)	 or	 a	 more	 complicated	 group	 of	 atoms.2	 It	 turns	 out	 that	 carboxylic	 acids	 are
made	 abundantly	 in	 a	 sparked	 mixture	 of	 methane,	 water,	 hydrogen,	 and	 ammonia.
They	 are	 also	 found,	 along	 with	 amino	 acids,	 in	 some	 meteorites.	 Then	 we	 must
assume	 that	 another	 class	 of	 molecules,	 called	 thiols,	 also	 existed	 in	 the	 prebiotic
broth.	Thiol	derives	from	the	Greek	word	for	sulfur,	and	the	general	formula	of	a	thiol
is	R′—SH,	where	R′	can	be	H	(in	which	case	the	thiol	is	simply	H2S,	hydrogen	sulfide)
or	a	group	containing	reduced	carbon,	such	as	—CH3,	to	make	methyl	thiol.	We	have
seen	 that	 H2S	 was	 probably	 originally	 present	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 of	 prebiotic	 Earth
and	if	not,	it	was	produced	by	hydrothermal	vents.	It	is	also	soluble	in	water.	It	could
thus	have	easily	reacted	in	solution,	under	the	action	of	UV	light,	with	reduced	carbon
formed	 from	 carbon	 dioxide	 through	 the	 iron	 cycle,	 to	 produce	 a	 variety	 of	 organic
thiols.

FIGURE	4.6	The	iron	cycle.	As	Fe2+	is	being	oxidized	into	Fe3+,	CO2	dissolved	in	water	is	reduced	into

Next,	 the	 carboxylic	 acids	 could	 have	 reacted	 with	 the	 thiols	 to	 form	 a	 class	 of
compounds	named	thioesters:

The	 ~	 sign	 in	 the	 thioester	 formula	 represents	 an	 energy-rich	 chemical	 bond.	 The
energy	necessary	to	form	that	thioester	bond	could	have	come	from	the	iron	cycle,	or
else	 this	 reaction	 could	 have	 occurred	 spontaneously	 at	 high	 temperature	 and	 high
acidity	(perhaps	as	in	hydrothermal	vents?).	Finally,	we	must	assume	that	phosphate
(H2PO4−)	 was	 present.	 Thus	 thioesters	 could	 have	 reacted	 with	 phosphate	 in	 the
following	way:
R′—S~CO—R	+	H2PO4−	→	R′—SH	+	R—CO—O~P—HO3
and
R—CO—O~P—HO3−	+	H2PO4−	→	R—COOH	+	H2P2O72−,
where	 H2P2O72−	 is	 pyrophosphate.	 Pyrophosphate,	 like	 ATP,	 is	 an	 energy-rich,
phosphate-containing	molecule,	and	it	could	have	played	a	role	in	protometabolism	in
the	 absence	 of	 adenine	 and	 ribose.	 What	 is	 also	 remarkable	 about	 this	 set	 of
reactions	 is	 that	 the	 carboxylic	 acid	 (R—COOH)	 and	 the	 thiol	 (R′—SH)	 are
regenerated	 and	 can	 thus	 enter	 a	 new	 cycle	 of	 energy-rich	 pyrophosphate
production.	 Taken	 together,	 the	 iron	 cycle	 and	 thioesters	 provide	 an	 interesting

Duve,	 has	 called	 it	 the	 “iron-thioester	 world.”	 Needless	 to	 say,	 not	 everyone	 agrees
with	 this	 scheme;	 particularly	 uncomfortable	 with	 it	 are	 those	 who	 think	 that
protometabolism	is	a	consequence	of	the	appearance	of	genetic	information,	not	the
other	way	around.
Nevertheless,	 the	 iron-sulfur	 world	 has	 more	 to	 offer.	 Having	 tackled	 the	 energy
problem,	proponents	of	this	view	also	think	that	protein	enzymes	may	have	appeared
without	 genetic	 information.	 We	 saw	 in	 chapter	 3	 that	 proteins	 are	 made	 by	 the
chemical	 linking	 of	 amino	 acids.	 This	 linking	 does	 not	 occur	 spontaneously	 and	 is
performed	in	cells,	as	we	have	seen,	through	the	mechanism	of	translation,	involving
not	 only	 the	 amino	 acids	 but	 also	 ribosomes	 and	 transfer	 RNAs.	 Assuming	 that
ribosomes	and	transfer	RNAs	did	not	exist	in	the	iron-sulfur	world,	how	could	proteins
have	formed?	Again,	thioesters	come	to	the	rescue.
As	 their	 name	 indicates,	 amino	 acids	 are	 acids.	 Not	 only	 that,	 they	 are	 also
carboxylic	 acids	 containing	 the	 —COOH	 group	 that	 we	 encountered	 before.	 Thus
amino	 acids	 could	 have	 reacted	 with	 thiols	 (R′—SH)	 to	 form	 thioesters,	 too.
Furthermore,	 it	 has	 been	 demonstrated	 that	 amino	 acid	 thioesters	 can	 polymerize
(make	 long	 chains	 of	 linked	 amino	 acids)	 spontaneously,	 without	 ribosomes	 and
tRNAs!	 Therefore	 the	 prebiotic	 broth	 may	 have	 contained	 a	 large,	 random	 set	 of
different	 proteins,	 all	 potentially	 composed	 of	 many	 different	 amino	 acid	 sequences.
And	these	proteins,	much	like	today’s	proteins	made	by	living	organisms,	could	have
possessed	 enzymatic	 activity.	 These	 “protoenzymes”	 could	 have	 progressively
synthesized	 the	 building	 blocks	 of	 nucleic	 acids	 (the	 nitrogenous	 bases),	 and	 they
even	 could	 have	 diversified	 the	 pool	 of	 amino	 acids	 to	 form	 other	 types	 of
protoenzymes.	 These	 many	 types	 of	 protoenzymes	 could	 then	 have	 been	 able	 to
catalyze	 the	 synthesis	 of	 RNA	 or	 DNA—that	 is,	 genes.	 At	 this	 point,	 the	 prebiotic
broth	would	have	become	informational.
There	 are,	 of	 course,	 problems	 with	 this	 view.	 For	 example,	 we	 do	 not	 know
whether	random	chains	formed	from	amino	acid	thioesters	have	any	kind	of	significant
and	 relevant	 enzymatic	 activity.	 This	 must	 be	 tested	 in	 the	 laboratory.	 Then	 it	 is
unclear	 whether	 these	 putative	 protoenzymes	 (with	 an	 assumed	 catalytic	 activity)
would	have	been	able	to	coordinate	their	activities	to	produce	any	significant	amount
of	 genetic	 material,	 RNA	 or	 DNA.	 Thus	 the	 iron-sulfur	 world	 is	 an	 interesting,
falsifiable	hypothesis	that	must	be	buttressed	by	a	considerable	amount	of	lab	work.
Nevertheless,	this	theory	is	attractive	because	it	does	provide	a	possible	path	to	RNA
or	DNA.
The	 Wächtershäuser	 model	 for	 the	 origin	 of	 protometabolism	 also	 relies	 on	 iron
and	 sulfur	 chemistry.	 This	 scientist	 (who	 is	 also	 a	 patent	 lawyer)	 does	 away
altogether	 with	 the	 notion	 of	 primordial	 broth.	 For	 him,	 Earth	 did	 not	 need	 a	 helping
hand	from	space,	lightning,	or	a	reducing	atmosphere;	all	necessary	ingredients	were
present	 from	 the	 beginning	 in	 volcanoes	 and	 hydrothermal	 vents.	 He	 considers	 that
only	CO2,	CO,	H2S	(present	today	in	volcanic	emissions	and	hydrothermal	vents),	and
FeS	(common	in	Earth’s	crust)	were	needed	to	get	protometabolism	started.
This	 is	 how	 it	 would	 have	 worked.	 First,	 as	 in	 the	 de	 Duve	 model,	 a	 source	 of

energy	and	electrons	(to	achieve	reduction	reactions)	is	necessary.	This	source	could
have	been	the	reaction	between	iron	sulfide	and	hydrogen	sulfide:
FeS	+	H2S	→	FeS2	+	2	e−	+	2	H+,
where	FeS2	is	pyrite.	In	addition	to	releasing	electrons	for	reduction,	this	reaction	also
releases	energy.	The	mineral	pyrite	formed	in	this	reaction	has	interesting	properties,
in	 that	 it	 can	 strongly	 bind	 to	 all	 sorts	 of	 electrically	 charged	 molecules.	 This,
according	 to	 Wächtershäuser,	 would	 have	 allowed	 organic	 molecules	 to	 line	 up	 in
close	 proximity	 on	 the	 mineral’s	 surface	 and	 undergo	 further	 chemical	 reactions,	 a
protometabolism	 of	 sorts.	 For	 example,	 the	 universal	 metabolite	 pyruvic	 acid	 (see
chapter	3)	can	actually	be	formed	in	a	sequence	of	three	reactions:

Copyright   2003. Columbia University Press. All rights reserved.

CO2	+	2FeS	+	2H2S	→	CH3—SH	+	2FeS2	+	2O
CH3—SH	+	CO	→	CH3—CO—SH
CH3—CO—SH	+	CO2	+	FeS	→	CH3—CO—COOH	+	FeS2,
where	CH3—CO—COOH	is	pyruvic	acid.	Other	protometabolic	reactions	would	have
occurred	 in	 a	 similar	 fashion,	 including	 the	 synthesis	 of	 amino	 acids	 and	 nucleotides,
necessary	to	make	proteins	and	RNA,	respectively.	In	this	scenario,	there	is	no	need
for	 thioesters	 (as	 in	 de	 Duve’s	 model).	 Nor	 is	 there	 need	 for	 organic	 material	 to	 be
delivered	 from	 outer	 space	 or	 from	 a	 reducing	 atmosphere.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 this
model	 provides	 no	 clue	 regarding	 the	 functions	 of	 putative	 protoenzymes	 and	 first
nucleic	acids.
Finally,	the	American	biochemist	Sydney	Fox	proposed	that	protein	enzymes	could
have	been	produced	on	prebiotic	Earth	in	the	absence	of	genetic	information.	For	this,
he	 first	 demonstrated	 that	 amino	 acids	 analogous	 to	 those	 found	 in	 a	 Miller-type	 of
experiment	 could	 also	 be	 synthesized	 by	 simply	 heating	 aqueous	 solutions	 of
formaldehyde	and	ammonia.	These	two	compounds	can	be	formed	under	a	variety	of
plausible	 prebiotic	 scenarios.	 Next,	 he	 demonstrated	 that	 heating	 dry	 mixtures	 of
amino	 acids	 leads	 to	 the	 production	 of	 polymers	 containing	 up	 to	 several	 hundred
chemically	linked	amino	acids,	thus	mimicking	modern	proteins.	Fox	used	dry	heat	in
these	 experiments	 for	 the	 following	 reason:	 the	 linking	 of	 amino	 acids	 to	 produce
protein	polymers	cannot	happen	in	water	because	this	reaction	is	accompanied	by	the
elimination	of	a	water	molecule.	Thus	in	an	aqueous	environment,	the	water	molecules

bonds	linking	amino	acids.
Fox	reasoned	that	some	of	the	primeval	aqueous	broth	with	its	amino	acids	could
have	 been	 splashed	 by	 the	 wind	 or	 waves	 onto	 hot	 rocks,	 where	 the	 water
evaporated	and	the	amino	acids	started	polymerizing.	This	effect	would	have	created
a	 large	 variety	 of	 randomly	 formed	 protein-like	 molecules.	 Some	 of	 these	 molecules
could	 have	 been	 endowed	 with	 enzyme	 activity	 and	 could	 have	 started	 a	 kind	 of
protometabolism,	 as	 assumed	 by	 de	 Duve	 in	 the	 case	 of	 thioester	 enzymes.	 The
question	then	is,	do	protein-like	polymers	“à	la	Fox”	made	in	the	laboratory	possess
any	kind	of	enzyme	activity?	The	answer	is	yes,	they	do,	albeit	weakly.	Furthermore,

Fox’s	proteinoids,	as	they	are	called,	can	spontaneously	form	microscopic	spheres	in
which	 molecules	 that	 will	 be	 acted	 upon	 by	 proteinoids	 can	 be	 trapped.	 Thus	 these
microspheres	 could	 be	 seen	 as	 primitive	 cells,	 possibly	 performing	 some
protometabolic	functions.
The	 main	 line	 of	 criticism	 aimed	 at	 these	 results	 and	 interpretations	 is	 that	 such
microspheres,	 even	 if	 they	 were	 formed	 and	 persisted	 (they	 are	 quite	 unstable	 and
fragile	 under	 laboratory	 conditions),	 could	 not	 have	 evolved	 because	 they	 contain	 no
genetic	information.	Of	course,	one	could	always	retort	that	proteinoid	microspheres
could	 have	 become	 capable	 of	 synthesizing	 random	 nucleic	 acids	 that	 were
themselves	 able	 to	 evolve.	 Fox	 died	 in	 1998	 and,	 to	 my	 knowledge,	 work	 on
proteinoids	has	stopped.

GENETIC	INFORMATION	FIRST:	THE	RNA	WORLD
Not	everyone	is	buying	the	iron-sulfur	world	hypothesis	and	its	haphazard
synthesis	 of	 protein	 catalysts	 in	 the	 total	 absence	 of	 genetic	 information.	 This
skepticism	also	applies	to	Sydney	Fox’s	theory.	Many	scientists	(possibly	a	majority)
prefer	to	think	that	genetic	information	came	first	and	that	proteins	followed	suit,	once
some	 kind	 of	 transcription/translation	 mechanism	 had	 evolved.	 For	 this	 to	 have
happened,	 it	 must	 be	 assumed	 that	 informational	 macromolecules	 such	 as	 DNA	 or
RNA	must	have	been	somehow	synthesized	in	the	absence	of	protein	enzymes.	In	the
late	1960s,	three	scientists,	Carl	Woese	of	the	United	States,	Leslie	Orgel	of	England
(but	 working	 in	 San	 Diego),	 and	 Nobel	 laureate	 Francis	 Crick	 of	 England	 (also
working	 in	 San	 Diego)	 independently	 proposed	 that	 RNA,	 not	 DNA,	 could	 have	 been
the	first	genetic	material.
There	 are	 four	 reasons	 for	 this.	 First,	 many	 viruses	 possess	 an	 RNA	 genome.
Second,	 the	 synthesis	 of	 DNA	 building	 blocks,	 deoxyribonucleotides	 (consisting	 of
nitrogenous	 bases	 linked	 to	 the	 sugar	 deoxyribose	 and	 to	 phosphate	 groups),
proceeds	 via	 ribonucleotide	 (the	 building	 blocks	 of	 RNA)	 intermediates.	 Third,	 DNA
replication	in	cells	is	“primed”	by	short	stretches	of	RNA.	And	fourth,	to	be	expressed,
DNA	genes	must	first	be	transcribed	into	RNA	molecules,	which	are	then	decoded	by
transfer	 RNAs	 on	 a	 ribosomal	 matrix	 composed	 of	 50	 percent	 RNA.	 These
observations	 suggested	 that	 RNA	 may	 be	 more	 ancestral	 than	 DNA	 and	 may	 have
constituted	the	very	first	genes.
This	hypothesis	raises	several	questions.	The	first	one	pertains	to	the	likelihood	of
synthesizing	the	building	blocks	of	RNA,	the	ribonucleotides,	made	of	the	bases	A,	U,
G,	and	C,	the	sugar	ribose,	and	three	phosphate	groups.	The	second	question	deals
with	linking	these	blocks	together	to	form	RNA	chains,	and	the	third	problem	is	how	to
make	 these	 RNA	 chains	 replicate	 (multiply)	 to	 keep	 them	 going	 so	 that	 they	 evolve
into	 genuine	 living	 cells.	 Today,	 all	 three	 mechanisms	 involve	 enzymes.	 In	 an	 RNA
world,	 there	 were	 no	 enzymes,	 and	 it	 must	 thus	 be	 assumed	 that	 ribonucleotide
synthesis,	polymerization,	and	RNA	replication	either	occurred	spontaneously	or	were

catalyzed	by	nonenzyme	catalysts.
We	have	seen	that	the	four	bases	could	have	been	formed	from	hydrogen	cyanide
or	 other	 carbon-	 and	 nitrogen-containing	 molecules	 under	 reducing	 conditions.
Alternatively,	 these	 bases	 could	 have	 been	 brought	 to	 Earth	 by	 meteorites	 and
comets	 (although	 cytosine	 has	 never	 been	 found	 in	 meteorites).	 The	 sugar	 ribose
could	 have	 been	 formed	 from	 the	 polymerization	 of	 formaldehyde,	 also	 presumably
abundant	 in	 the	 prebiotic	 broth,	 as	 it	 is	 in	 space.	 The	 problem	 here	 is	 that	 the
polymerization	of	formaldehyde	produces	many	other	types	of	sugars	besides	ribose,
and	 these	 other	 sugars	 also	 have	 a	 propensity	 to	 react	 with	 the	 four	 bases.	 Some
authors	 have	 recently	 proposed	 that	 in	 the	 beginning,	 nucleic	 acids	 other	 than	 RNA
may	 have	 been	 more	 prevalent.	 These	 include	 molecules	 formed	 with	 sugars
containing	 six	 carbon	 atoms	 instead	 of	 the	 five	 found	 in	 the	 ribose	 ring,	 or	 a	 fivecarbon-containing	 sugar	 (called	 threose,	 hence	 the	 abbreviation	 TNA	 for	 the	 nucleic
acids	containing	it)	with	a	structure	slightly	different	from	that	of	ribose.	Thus	it	is	not
impossible	 that	 originally	 there	 was	 a	 whole	 family	 of	 nucleic	 acids	 whose	 members
contained	 different	 sugars,	 with	 RNA	 finally	 taking	 over	 for	 unknown	 reasons.
According	to	some,	phosphorus	could	have	originated	from	organic	phosphates	found
in	meteorites.
So	 far,	 linking	 the	 four	 RNA	 bases	 to	 sugars	 in	 the	 laboratory,	 under	 plausible
prebiotic	 conditions,	 has	 been	 successful	 only	 with	 A	 and	 G.	 Such	 reactions	 with	 U
and	 C	 have	 not	 been	 observed.	 This	 is	 definitely	 a	 nagging	 problem,	 because	 it	 is
hard	to	visualize	RNA	synthesis	without	the	existence	of	ribo-U	and	ribo-C.	Can	these
compounds	 be	 formed	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 special,	 and	 as	 yet	 undiscovered,
catalysts?	Were	TNAs	involved?	We	simply	do	not	know.	On	the	other	hand,	adding
phosphate	groups	to	preformed	combinations	of	bases	and	ribose	has	been	achieved
with	 all	 four	 bases.	 The	 problem	 here	 is	 that	 many	 of	 the	 base-sugar-phosphate
combinations	(called	nucleotides)	have	structures	that	would	not	allow	polymerization
into	 RNA	 molecules.	 Clearly,	 much	 remains	 to	 be	 done	 to	 elucidate	 the	 mechanisms
by	which	correct	structures	where	formed	in	prevalent	amounts.	One	possibility	is	that
mineral	 catalysts	 favored	 the	 formation	 of	 correct	 molecular	 structures,	 but	 such
catalysts	 have	 not	 yet	 been	 discovered.	 Alternatively,	 it	 might	 be	 imagined	 that	 the
correct	 molecules	 were	 formed	 with	 the	 help	 of	 protoenzymes	 and	 pyrophosphate
previously	made	in	an	iron-sulfur	world.
Also,	 sugars	 found	 in	 modern	 nucleic	 acids	 pose	 a	 handedness	 problem,	 just	 as
seen	 with	 amino	 acids.	 The	 sugars	 present	 in	 RNA	 and	 DNA	 are	 right-handed.
However,	 prebiotic	 sugars	 must	 have	 been	 made	 in	 the	 right-	 and	 left-handed
configurations	 in	 equal	 amounts.	 We	 do	 not	 know	 how	 right-handed	 sugars	 were
eventually	 selected	 for	 the	 synthesis	 of	 nucleic	 acids.	 Nevertheless,	 assuming	 that
pools	 of	 nucleotides	 with	 the	 correct	 structure	 came	 into	 existence,	 it	 is	 now
necessary	 to	 link	 these	 nucleotides	 together	 to	 form	 RNA	 chains.	 Interestingly,	 this
has	been	achieved	in	the	laboratory	by	simply	incubating	nucleotides	in	the	presence
of	 minerals	 such	 as	 lead	 salts,	 uranium	 salts,	 zinc	 salts,	 or	 even	 clay.	 RNA	 chains
consisting	 of	 up	 to	 fifty	 bases	 linked	 together	 were	 synthesized	 on	 a	 clay

(montmorillonite)	 substrate.	 Quite	 certainly,	 these	 findings	 make	 plausible	 the
synthesis	of	RNA	chains	under	prebiotic	conditions.
But	 then	 there	 remains	 the	 problem	 of	 replicating	 these	 RNA	 molecules.	 Without
replication,	the	genetic	information	present	in	an	RNA	molecule	will	be	lost	as	soon	as
this	molecule	degrades.	Furthermore,	without	replication	and	errors	in	the	replication
process,	 RNA	 molecules	 once	 formed	 cannot	 change—they	 cannot	 evolve.	 Perhaps
surprisingly,	 RNA	 replication	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 enzymes	 may	 not	 have	 been	 as
daunting	 a	 challenge	 as	 was	 once	 thought.	 Clues	 to	 the	 prebiotic	 copying	 of	 RNA
molecules	were	provided	by	the	discovery	of	ribozymes,	RNA	enzymes.
Until	 1983,	 that	 all	 biological	 catalysts	 were	 protein	 enzymes	 was	 a	 firmly
entrenched	 notion.	 That	 year,	 Thomas	 Cech	 and	 Sidney	 Altman	 independently
discovered	 that	 this	 dogma	 was	 wrong.	 They	 both	 received	 the	 Nobel	 Prize	 for	 this
discovery.	 Their	 findings	 unexpectedly	 showed	 that	 RNA	 too	 possesses	 catalytic,
enzymatic	activity,	hence	the	name	ribozyme	(a	combination	of	the	words	ribonucleic
acid	 and	 enzyme).	 What	 kind	 of	 enzymatic	 activities	 are	 displayed	 by	 RNA
molecules?	First,	there	are	conditions	under	which	living	cells	“cut”	some	of	their	RNA
molecules	 by	 cleaving	 their	 ribose-phosphate	 backbone	 at	 predetermined	 positions
(figure	 4.7).	 This	 cutting	 is	 done	 by	 the	 RNA	 itself,	 with	 no	 help	 whatsoever	 from
protein	 enzymes.	 Next,	 it	 was	 discovered	 that	 ribozymes	 could	 actually	 copy
themselves	and	thus	replicate,	again,	in	the	total	absence	of	protein	enzymes!	It	must
be	 cautioned,	 however,	 that	 only	 short	 RNA	 molecules,	 a	 few	 dozen	 nucleotides	 in
length,	 can	 be	 replicated	 that	 way	 in	 the	 laboratory.	 And	 finally,	 it	 was	 recently
discovered	that	ribosomal	RNA	(present	in	the	ribosomes,	where	protein	synthesis	is
taking	place	in	cells)	is	responsible	for	the	polymerization	of	amino	acids	into	proteins.
In	 other	 words,	 it	 is	 not	 a	 ribosomal	 protein	 enzyme	 that	 hooks	 up	 amino	 acids
together	to	make	protein	chains;	ribosomal	RNA	itself	does	the	job.	Some	ribozymes
even	have	the	ability	to	splice	short	RNA	molecules	together	to	produce	longer	ones.
Finally,	 RNA	 chains	 consisting	 of	 as	 few	 as	 twenty	 nucleotides	 have	 been	 shown	 to
possess	ribozyme	activity.	This	number	is	well	within	the	ability	of	clay	to	catalyze	the
synthesis	of	RNA	chains.

The	 discoveries	 that	 certain	 RNA	 molecules	 can	 cut	 themselves	 and	 other	 RNA
molecules,	 that	 they	 can	 join	 RNA	 molecules	 together,	 that	 some	 ribozymes	 can
replicate,	and	that	certain	RNA	molecules	can	catalyze	the	formation	of	proteins	have
given	 credence	 to	 a	 putative	 RNA	 world.	 In	 this	 prebiotic	 world,	 primitive	 RNA
genomes	 could	 replicate,	 become	 processed	 by	 cutting	 and	 splicing,	 and	 help	 make
proteins	that	later	could	become	genuine	enzymes,	taking	over	some	of	the	ribozyme
properties	 and	 creating	 an	 integrated	 metabolic	 circuitry.	 Before	 this	 could	 happen,
RNA	 genomes	 had	 to	 evolve	 through	 replication	 and	 replication	 errors	 in	 order	 to
generate	genetic	diversity,	much	as	natural	selection	does	in	the	world	today.	We	will
see	how	this	may	have	happened	in	the	next	chapter.

We	do	not	know	how	the	building	blocks	of	life	appeared	on	Earth.	They
may	 have	 originated	 from	 organic	 material	 present	 in	 interstellar	 clouds,	 from
meteorites	and	comets,	from	hydrothermal	vents,	from	a	reducing	atmosphere,	from
all	 four,	 or	 from	 sources	 we	 have	 not	 yet	 imagined.	 Whether	 proteins	 antedated
nucleic	 acids	 in	 an	 iron-sulfur	 world	 or	 whether	 an	 RNA	 world	 gave	 birth	 to	 the	 first
proteins	is	equally	unknown.	Perhaps	even	the	iron-sulfur	and	RNA	worlds	cooperated
to	get	life	started.	We	have	several	scenarios	but	we	do	not	know	which	one	or	ones
prevailed.	What	this	chapter	has	shown,	however,	is	that	scientists	do	not	suffer	from
a	 lack	 of	 imagination.	 The	 hypotheses	 presented	 here	 are	 testable,	 and	 new
discoveries,	such	as	the	catalytic	properties	of	RNA,	will	continue	to	provide	material
for	further	research	and	hypothesis	formulation.
In	1998,	the	British	Broadcasting	Corporation	released	a	video	entitled	“The	Origin
of	 Life:	 Researching	 the	 Possibilities.”	 I	 highly	 recommend	 it	 to	 readers,	 not	 only	 for
its	 informational	 content	 and	 its	 general	 quality	 but	 also	 for	 its	 humorous	 look	 at	 the
problem.	 The	 program	 features	 among	 others,	 Stanley	 Miller	 (in	 front	 of	 his	 famous
“gas	zapper”)	and	Günter	Wächtershäuser	(handling	a	block	of	his	cherished	pyrite).
Consciously	 or	 unconsciously,	 some	 of	 the	 scientists	 appear	 as	 enthusiastic	 nerds3
(one	 of	 them,	 unable	 to	 find	 a	 chalkboard	 to	 explain	 something	 to	 the	 interviewer,
casually	and	very	naturally	uses	his	office	door	to	write	on),	vindictive	prima	donnas,
or	self-assured	wise	men.	This	video	is	also	a	lesson	in	the	sociology	of	science.
