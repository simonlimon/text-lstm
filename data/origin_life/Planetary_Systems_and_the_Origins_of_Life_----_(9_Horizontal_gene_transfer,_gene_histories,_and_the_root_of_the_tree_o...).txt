9.1 Introduction
Tracing organismal (species) histories on large evolutionary timescales remains
a big challenge in evolutionary biology. Darwin metaphorically labelled these
relationships the ‘tree of life’, but in his notebook he expressed unhappiness with
this label, because in the ‘tree of life’ depicting species evolution only the tips of
the branches are alive; this layer of living organisms rests on dead ancestors and
extinct relatives. Darwin mused that therefore the term ‘coral of life’ would be
more appropriate (B26 in Darwin (1987)); however, this alternative label did not
gain popularity. Different markers have been utilized to elucidate the relationship
among different lineages: from morphological characters to complete genomes.
Since complete genomes are now available for organisms from all three domains of
life, it is possible to use large amounts of data to attempt to decipher the relationships
between all known organisms.
Many comparative genome analyses have shown that different genes in genomes
often have different evolutionary histories (e.g., Hilario and Gogarten (1993),
Nesbo et al. (2001), and Zhaxybayeva et al. (2004)), which implies that the tree of
life metaphor (and a bifurcating tree as a model for evolutionary relationships in
general) might be no longer adequate (Doolittle, 1999). The incongruence between
gene histories can be attributed to many factors, one of which is horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). Simulations based on coalescence have shown that HGT can affect
not only the topology of an inferred phylogeny (and therefore inferences of last
common ancestors), but also divergence times (Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2004;
Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005). In this chapter we review challenges in multigene
analyses in light of HGT and discuss the consequences for inferring the position of
the root of the tree/coral of life.

9.2 How to analyse multigene data?
In addition to different models and methods for sequence analyses (see Chapter 8
for an overview), many methodologies exist for the analysis of multiple genes.
One approach is to combine individual genes into a single dataset to extract
phylogenetic information that might be distributed over many gene families; this
so-called ‘supermatrix approach’ is often cited as a way to improve the resolution
of the inferred phylogeny (Brown et al., 2001; Delsuc et al., 2005). In this
approach, the individual gene alignments are concatenated into one superalignment,
if the individual gene histories are found to have compatible (non-conﬂicting)
phylogenetic histories. Then the superalignment is analysed as if it were one gene
alignment, but with an advantage of containing a larger number of sites informative
for phylogenetic analysis.
A problem with direct concatenation is the selection of data to include. This
selection is complicated by the fact that the absence of evidence for transfer cannot
be taken as evidence for the absence of transfer. If one applies a stringent measure
for the detection of conﬂict, nearly all genes agree with each other within the limits
of conﬁdence. The amount of conﬂict detected depends on the chosen limits of
conﬁdence and on the extent of taxon sampling (Snel et al., 2002; Daubin et al.,
2003; Mirkin et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2005; Kunin et al., 2005).
Testing the compatibility between different trees and the alignments from
which these trees were derived using the Shimodaira–Hasegawa (Shimodaira and
Hasegawa, 1999) or approximately unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002) has
become the preferred tool for assessing potential conﬂict between individual gene
families (e.g., Lerat et al. (2003)). In these tests, the ﬁt of alternative topologies to
an alignment is evaluated and the trees under which the data have a signiﬁcantly
worse probability are rejected and considered as incompatible with the data. (The
probability of observing the data given a model of evolution and a phylogenetic tree
is also known as the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree.) However, the failure to reject
a tree should not be mistaken for evidence for congruence with a tree (Bapteste
et al., 2004). A gene might indeed have evolved with a different history, and this
history might be different from the consensus phylogeny, but the individual gene
family contains too little phylogenetically useful information to make the likelihood
of the two phylogenies signiﬁcantly different. This is analogous to the failure in
detecting a signiﬁcant correlation between fat intake and cancer (Prentice et al.,
2006): it does not prove that the correlation does not exist; it only says that the
correlation was not signiﬁcant in the dataset, possibly because too small a sample
was studied.
Another challenge to inferences based on concatenation may come from hidden,
or unrecognized, paralogy in lineages that went through frequent gene duplication

Horizontal gene transfer, gene histories, and the root of the tree of life

and aneupolyploidization (i.e., having multiple, albeit each incomplete, sets of
chromosomes). Especially in animals with metameric organization (i.e., with the
body divided into a number of similar segments), gene and genome duplications
have long been postulated to have created the regulatory complexity necessary
for the different bodyplans (e.g., Nam and Nei (2005)). Multiple whole genome
duplications were inferred for the early evolution of plants (Cui et al., 2006)
and vertebrates (Escriva et al., 2002; Meyer and Van de Peer, 2005). These gene
duplications have led to gene families with often astounding diversity (e.g., Foth
et al. (2006)).
However, it is not the complexity of the gene families in itself that generates
problems in phylogenetic reconstruction; rather, the frequent loss of one or the
other paralogue (Hughes and Friedman, 2004; Nam and Nei, 2005) can lead to
the inclusion of unrecognized paralogues in the datasets, with the result that some
of the events in the genes’ histories reﬂect gene duplication and not speciation
events. For example, analysing the homeobox gene superfamily in 11 genomes,
Nam and Nei (2005) inferred 88 homeobox genes to have been present in the
ancestor of bilateral animals. Thirty–forty of these were completely lost in one of
the 11 species analysed, and many of the ones still represented underwent frequent
gene duplications, especially in vertebrates, where more than 200 homeobox
genes are found per haploid genome. In a study of four animal genomes,
Hughes and Friedman (2004) observe massive (19–20% of gene families present
in common ancestor) parallel loss in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster.
An alternative to the supermatrix approaches (Delsuc et al., 2005) is to analyse
genes individually and to combine the resulting trees (or the bipartitions/embedded
quartets constituting the trees) into a consensus signal (i.e., the phylogenetic signal
supported by at least a plurality of genes) by using supertree methods (Beiko et al.,
2005), bipartition plotting (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2004), or quartet decomposition
(Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006). As an example, Figure 9.1A shows bipartition analysis
of 678 gene families present in ten cyanobacterial genomes (see Zhaxybayeva
et al. (2004) for more details). A bipartition plot shows all bipartitions signiﬁcantly
supported by at least one gene family and allows us to extract quickly the plurality
signal as well as gene families conﬂicting with it. Notably, for cyanobacteria,
only three compatible bipartitions are supported by the plurality of genes, resulting
in a not very resolved plurality consensus (Figure 9.1B). And even those three
bipartitions are conﬂicted strongly by 13 gene families (i.e., these genes support a
conﬂicting partition with >99% bootstrap support; see Figure 9.1 legend for the list
of gene families). An advantage of the bipartition plotting approach is that only the
signal retained in the plurality of datasets is used to synthesize the consensus; the

Bipartitions

Fig. 9.1. Bipartition plot analysis of 678 gene families in ten cyanobacterial
genomes. An unrooted phylogenetic tree can be represented as a set of bipartitions
(or splits). If a branch of a tree is removed, the tree ‘splits’ into two sets of leaves.
A bipartition of an unrooted phylogenetic tree is deﬁned as a division of the tree
into two mutually exclusive sets of leaves. A. Plot of bipartitions with at least
70% bootstrap support. Each column represents the number of gene families that
support (columns that are pointing upwards) or conﬂict (columns that are pointing
downwards) a bipartition. The columns are sorted by number of gene families
supporting each bipartition. The level of bootstrap support is coded by different
shades of gray. For details of phylogenetic analyses see Zhaxybayeva et al. (2004).
B. Plurality consensus reconstructed from the three most supported partitions.
The genes that are in conﬂict with the consensus at >99% bootstrap support
encode ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit, cell division protein
FtsH, translation initiation factor IF-2, ferredoxin, geranylgeranyl hydrogenase,
amidophosphoribosyltransferase, photosystem II protein D2, photosystem II
CP43 protein, photosystem II CP47 protein, photosystem I core protein A2,
photosystem I core protein A1, photosystem II manganese-stabilizing protein, and
5 -methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.

disadvantage is that individual gene analyses often suffer from a lack of resolution
due to an insufﬁcient number of phylogenetically informative positions.
Regardless of the method used to arrive at the consensus, the question still
remains: what does the signal inferred from multigene data mean? Does it serve
as a proxy for an organismal phylogeny? Does it sometimes reﬂect grouping by
ecotypes? In the next section we explore these questions by considering an example
of four marine cyanobacteria.

9.3 What does the plurality consensus represent? Example of small
marine cyanobacteria
At the time of the analysis, four genomes of small coccoid marine cyanobacteria
of broadly similar lifestyles had been completely sequenced: Prochlorococcus
marinus CCMP1375 (also known as SS120), Prochlorococcus marinus MED4,
Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, and marine Synechococcus WH8102.
Members of the Prochlorococcus genus have only been discovered quite recently
due to their small size and anomalously low ﬂuorescence (Chisholm et al., 1988).
Marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are proposed to diverge from a
common phycobilisome-containing ancestor (Ting et al., 2002). The phycobilisome
is a light-harvesting complex associated with photosystem II and is used as
a light-harvesting antenna in most cyanobacteria. Phylobilisomes, in contrast
to the light-harvesting complexes of higher plants, are not embedded in the
photosynthetic membrane, and they contain phycobilins as pigments, which give
the cyanobacteria their typical blue-green colour. While marine Synechococcus still
uses phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae (an ancestral trait), members of
the Prochlorococcus genus lack phycobilisomes and utilize a different chlorophylcontaining antenna complex (Pcb). Prochlorococcus also possess derivatives of
chlorophyll a and b pigments that are unique to this genus (see Partensky et al.
(1999) for a review). In addition, marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
are adapted to different ecological niches: marine Synechococcus is prevalent in
coastal waters, while Prochlorococcus is ubiquitous in open subtropical and tropical
ocean. Within Prochlorococcus marinus two ‘ecotypes’are differentiated: low-light
adapted and high-light adapted types (Rocap et al., 2003). In the 16S rRNA tree,
low-light adapted Prochlorococcus spp. form a paraphyletic clade with respect to
high-light adapted Prochlorococcus spp. (Ting et al., 2002). Beiko et al. (2005)
reported more than 250 HGT events among these marine cyanobacteria. In their
supertree as well as in our bipartition analyses (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2004) the
marine cyanobacteria cluster into two clades: P. marinus CCMP1375 (‘low-light’
adapted) groups with P. marinus MED4 (‘high-light’), and P. marinus MIT9313
(‘low-light’) groups with marine Synechococcus WH8102 (Beiko et al. (2005)
and Figure 9.1B). Interestingly, the relationship among these four genomes as
captured by the supertree and bipartition analyses does not support the relationship
inferred from phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA (e.g., Ting et al., 2002), or the
groupings based on proposed ecotypes (Ting et al., 2002; Rocap et al., 2003),
or the many derived characteristics shared between the three Prochlorococcus
species. These results are conﬁrmed through independent analyses of cyanobacteria
utilizing embedded quartets (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006). One explanation for the
conﬂict between the genome consensus, and the many complex derived characters

is rampant gene ﬂow among these genomes, such that the plurality consensus no
longer reﬂects the ecotype, physiology, and organismal history. In support of this
hypothesis, cyanophages infecting marine cyanobacteria have been reported to
contain genes important for photosynthesis (Mann et al., 2003; Lindell et al., 2004;
Millard et al., 2004; Sullivan et al., 2005; Zeidner et al., 2005), and likely mediate
transfer and recombination of these genes among the marine cyanobacteria (Zeidner
et al., 2005).
Notably, such an observation is not limited to prokaryotes. For example,
in incipient species of Darwin’s ﬁnches frequent introgression can make some
individuals characterized as belonging to the same species by morphology and
mating behaviour genetically more similar to a sister species (Grant et al., 2004).

9.4 Where is the root of the ‘tree of life’?
In phylogenetic analysis using molecular sequences external information is required
to identify the root of an inferred tree, i.e., the node from which all other nodes
of the tree are descended. Usually, an outgroup is needed to root a tree, i.e., a
taxon which is known to diverge earlier than the group of interest. However, this
methodology becomes inapplicable to the problem of rooting the tree of life (since
all organisms are part of the group of interest). One method of determining the
root of the tree of life from molecular data is to use ancient duplication events.
If a gene duplication event has occurred before the divergence of all extant
organisms, then the phylogenetic tree containing both gene duplicates will be
symmetrical, and one set of duplicated genes can be used as an outgroup to the
other. In the past, several pairs of anciently duplicated genes have been detected and
analysed. The analyses produced a variety of controversial results as summarized
in Table 9.1. A large-scale comparison of anciently duplicated genes did not bring
any consensus (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005), as possible locations of the root were
observed in various places (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2005). If some groups of organisms
evolve slower than others in molecular and physiological characteristics, then their
phenotype might be considered as reﬂecting the phenotype of the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) (Woese, 1987; Xue et al., 2003; Ciccarelli et al., 2006).
However, these presumably primitive characteristics do not allow us to place the
ancestor in the tree of life, because they do not inform us about the relationship
between the slow and fast evolving groups (Cejchan, 2004).
Inspecting phylogenies based on molecular characters one often forgets that
the deeper parts of the tree of life are formed by only those lineages that have
extant representatives. However, these lineages were not the only ones present in
earlier times. Many lineages became extinct, or at least their extant representatives have not been discovered. It is reasonable to assume that at the time of the

organismal MRCA many other organisms were in existence as well (Figure 9.2). If
the processes of speciation and extinction can be approximated by a random process,
coalescence theory would be an appropriate tool to describe lineages through time
plots (Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2004).
Due to the vast time spans needed for the lineages to coalesce to their MRCA,
the individual phylogenies from extant lineages usually have two longest branches
leading to the MRCA, and therefore these phylogenetic analyses will be subject to
potential long branch attraction (LBA) artefacts. Therefore, additional higher order
shared derived characters (synapomorphies) are helpful to reinforce the inferred
position of the root. Larger insertions/deletions or derived structural features
are considered rare and mostly irreversible and may serve as synapomorphies
(e.g., see Gupta (2001) for the application of presumably unique insertions/deletions
to organismal classiﬁcation). For example, the domain architecture differences
between β and β  RNA polymerase subunits were used to polarize the tree of
bacterial RNA polymerases (Iyer et al., 2004). In another study, the position of the
root in the Glx-tRNA synthetase family tree was inferred from structural differences
in anticodon binding domains between GlnRS and GluRS (Siatecka et al., 1998).
Below we examine in detail the use of additional characters in supporting the
position of the root in the phylogenetic tree of ATPases.
9.5 Use of higher order characters: example of ATPases
The use of ATPase catalytic and non-catalytic subunits to root the tree of life was
originally introduced by Gogarten et al. (1989). This pair of anciently duplicated
genes places the root on the branch leading to Bacteria with high conﬁdence
(see Figure 9.3). Either the catalytic or the non-catalytic subunits can be considered

as the ingroup, and the outgroup is provided by the paralogous subunits. The
outgroup, a set of sequences rather divergent from the ingroup, joins the ingroup
on the longest internal branch. While this placement of the root is recovered
using different methods and evolutionary models (Gogarten et al., 1989; Iwabe
et al., 1989), it also coincides with the place where the root would be located
as the result of the LBA artefact (Philippe and Forterre, 1999; Gribaldo and
Philippe, 2002). However, in the case of the ATPases higher order characters
exclude placing the outgroup within the archaeal/eukaryotic ATPases subunits
(no higher order characters have been recognized for bacterial F-ATPases). The
archaeal vacuolar ATPase non-catalytic subunits have lost the canonical Walker
motif GxxGxGKT in their ATP binding pocket (Gogarten et al., 1989). This motif
is present in the orthologous F-ATPase non-catalytic subunits as well as in all of the
ancient paralogues, including the paralogous Rho transcription termination factors
(Richardson, 2002) and ATPases involved in assembly of the bacterial ﬂagella

(Vogler et al., 1991). Similarly, the catalytic subunits of the archaeal and of the
eukaryotic vacuolar typeATPase contain a faster evolving ‘non-homologous’region
that has no counterpart in the catalytic F-ATPase subunits, nor is this region found in
any of the non-catalytic subunits (Zimniak et al., 1988; Gogarten et al., 1989). The
absence of the canonical Walker motif in the regulatory subunits and the presence
of the non-homologous region in the catalytic subunits thus are shared derived
characters of the vacuolar and archaeal ATPases that preclude moving the root of
the ATPase phylogeny to a place within the clade constituted by the archaeal and
eukaryotic ATPases.

Horizontal gene transfer, gene histories, and the root of the tree of life

9.6 Conclusions
Consideration of gene transfer makes the analysis of species evolution among
prokaryotes similar to population genetics.As is the case for within species analyses,
gene trees for diverse groups of prokaryotes do not coalesce to the same ancestor,
and the organisms that carried the molecular ancestors often lived at different times.
For example, the human Y chromosome of all human males is traced back to an
MRCA (‘Adam’) who lived approximately 50 000 years ago (Thomson et al., 2000;
Underhill et al., 2000), while mitochondrial genes trace back to an MRCA (‘Eve’)
who lived about 166 000–249 000 years ago (Cann et al., 1987; Vigilant et al., 1991).
Many thousand years separate ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’ from each other. The analogy to
gene trees in recombining populations suggests that no single last common ancestor
contained all the genes ancestral to the ones shared between the three domains of
life. Each contemporary molecule traces back to an individual molecular MRCA,
but these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at
different times. Therefore, even with more accurate phylogenetic reconstruction
methods, one should not expect different molecular phylogenies to agree with one
another on the placement of the MRCA of all living organisms. Adaptation of
population genetics methodology may provide more fruitful results in studying
early evolutionary events.
