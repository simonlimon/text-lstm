3.1 Introduction
Kant (1755) and Laplace (1796) laid the foundations of our theory of planet
formation, arguing that the Solar System formed in a ﬂattened disk orbiting the Sun.
Today we know such disks to be a part of the star formation process (see Chapter 4),
and we have come a long way toward understanding the details of how a protostellar
disk turns itself into planets. Most importantly, for ten years now we have been
ﬁnding planets orbiting other stars; the current count of detected exoplanets exceeds
180, so that the Solar System now constitutes only a small minority of all known
planets. The bad news is that Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars remain the only
examples of terrestrial planets we know, since such bodies are still well below
the mass threshold for detection around ordinary stars. Thus, apart from a pair
of bodies orbiting the pulsar PSR1257 + 12 (Wolszczan and Frail, 1992), all
known exoplanets are giants: gaseous bodies like Jupiter or Saturn with a couple
of potentially Neptune-like examples recently added to the menagerie. However,
impressive as the ‘king of the planets’ and its kind are, it is a terrestrial planet – a
modest rocky body, three-thousandths Jupiter’s mass – which actually harbours the
life in our Solar System. And as we contemplate the possibility of life elsewhere
in the Universe, it is inevitably upon terrestrial planets that we focus our attention.
It is thus especially important to attempt to understand the process of terrestrial
planet formation, so that even in the absence of direct observations, we can assess
the likelihood of other planets like our own existing around other stars. At the
same time, such work allows us to plan ahead for future terrestrial planet-hunting
missions like KEPLER, COROT, and (if it is resurrected) the Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF).
This chapter gives an overview of the theory of terrestrial planet formation
as it currently stands. We begin with the formation of the basic building blocks,
planetesimals, in Section 3.2. In Section 3.3, we look at how protoplanets grow from

the agglomeration of planetesimals. This brings us to the ﬁnal stage of terrestrial
planet formation in Section 3.4, wherein the protoplanets collide to produce
bodies like Earth and Venus. We examine the ‘standard mode’ of how this stage
plays out, together with some more recent variations, as well as the constraints
cosmochemistry places on the the timeline of the Earth’s formation. In Section 3.5,
we summarize the current state of the impact model for the origin of the Earth–Moon
system. In Section 3.6, we consider terrestrial planet formation and evolution from
an astrobiology perspective, including the concept of the habitable zone and the
puzzle posed by the Late Heavy Bombardment. A summary is given in Section 3.7.

3.2 The formation of planetesimals
In the ﬁrst phase of terrestrial planet formation, solids condense out of the
protostellar gas disk as dust grains, settle to the disk midplane, and eventually form
kilometre-sized planetesimals. The actual mechanism of planetesimal formation
remains unclear. Goldreich and Ward (1973) put forward a model in which the
dust layer becomes sufﬁciently thin that it undergoes gravitational instability,
contracting (in the terrestrial region) into kilometre-sized clumps and thus
producing planetesimals directly. However, Weidenschilling (1995) pointed out
that turbulent stirring of the dust layer would likely prevent gravitational instability.
The dust particles are on Keplerian orbits while the gas disk, being partly supported
by its own internal pressure, revolves at slightly less than the Keplerian rate. The
resulting vertical shear in velocity at the dust–gas interface induces turbulence in the
dust layer, preventing it from becoming thin enough for the onset of gravitational
instability.
Because of this problem, the most widely held current view is that dust particles
build planetesimals by pairwise accretion. Laboratory experiments suggest that
growth of dust to centimetre-sized aggregates proceeds quite easily, probably
in 106 y (Paraskov et al. (2005 and references therein). At metre size and larger,
the process is less well understood. For one thing, it is unclear how readily larger
bodies stick together. Turbulent eddies in the gas disk may play a role in bringing
about local particle concentrations (e.g., Barranco and Marcus (2005)). However,
orbital decay due to aerodynamic gas drag from the nebula seems to present a
problem. Due to the sub-Keplerian rotation of the gas, a solid body orbiting with
the disk experiences a headwind, loses energy, and experiences continual orbital
shrinking. Orbital decay rates are peaked for metre-sized bodies; for typical nebula
models, such planetesimals spiral from 1 AU (= astronomical unit, the mean radius
of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, which is 1.5 × 1013 cm) into the central star
on a timescale of order 100 years (Weidenschilling, 1977). Thus, it appears growth
through this size regime must be extremely rapid in order to avoid the loss of all

solids. Another possibility is that ﬂuctuations in nebular gas density, turbulent or
otherwise, may locally stall the migration.

3.3 The growth of protoplanets
Once the solids in the protoplanetary disk are mostly locked up in kilometresized bodies, their interactions become dominated by gravity, and in a sense
the dynamics becomes simpler. We will begin with a qualitative description of
what happens next. The planetesimals are on nearly circular coplanar Keplerian
orbits within the disk, although mutual perturbations induce slight deviations from
this. In terms of orbital elements, the planetesimals’ interactions induce in each
other non-zero orbital eccentricities (thus making neighbouring orbits cross) and
inclinations (thus vertically ‘pufﬁng up’ the disk). Since the self-stirring of the disk
is gravitational, the upper limit to the relative velocities induced in the planetesimals
is the surface escape velocity from the locally largest bodies. Therefore initially,
when two planetesimals collide, they usually do so at an impact velocity low enough
that accretion dominates over shattering. Larger-mass bodies have larger collision
cross-sections, so accretion eventually becomes a runaway process: a relatively
small subset of larger bodies, or protoplanets, grows very rapidly in the disk,
consuming the smaller neighbours. However, runaway growth eventually runs out
of steam when it becomes too successful; once the largest protoplanets are massive
enough to dominate the gravitational stirring of the nearby disk, the feedback for
accretion switches from positive to negative, and larger protoplanets grow more
slowly than smaller ones. Thus neighbouring protoplanets converge toward similar
sizes. For the little planetesimals it is now too late; with the large bodies having
taken over the stirring, they now smash into each other at impact velocities too high
for much accretion to occur, and they are reduced to serving as building material
for the protoplanets. With the population of similar-sized protoplanets now ﬁrmly
in charge, this regime is called oligarchic growth. The protoplanets keep sweeping
up planetesimals, and occasionally two neighbours merge, until there is nothing
but protoplanets left.
We can gain some additional insight from a more quantitative approach. To begin
with, a universally important quantity is the Hill radius (or Hill sphere), which gives
a measure of gravitational reach of a body orbiting a central mass. For a companion
of mass M orbiting a primary of mass M∗ at a distance r, it is deﬁned as


M 1/3
rH =
r.
(3.1)
3M∗
This is the radius within which a third body (with mass  M ) is able to orbit
around M . Thus a moon must be within its parent planet’s Hill sphere. Of course,

Terrestrial planet formation

this is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition; a would-be satellite approaching a
planet too fast will simply pass through the Hill sphere with some deﬂection, rather
than be captured.
If the relative velocities between neighbouring planetesimals are dispersiondominated – i.e., the main contribution to their relative velocities is their mutual
perturbations, rather than the difference in Keplerian speed between neighbouring
orbits – their growth rate can be estimated using a simple ‘particle in a box’approach
(Lissauer (1993) and references therein):

where ρplsmls is the density with which planetesimals are distributed in the
planetesimal disk, σ is the collisional cross-section of a planetesimal, and vrel
is the average relative velocity between nearby planetesimals. The collisional
cross-section of a planetesimal is given by

where R is the planetesimal’s physical radius, vesc = 2GM /R is the escape
velocity from its surface, and fg is the enhancement of the cross-section by
gravitational focusing. With a few substitutions and simpliﬁcations, we can gain
more insight from Equation (3.2). To begin with, we will assume that gravitational
focusing is effective, so that fg

plsmls is the surface density of the planetesimal disk, and Hplsmls is the disk’s

(3.4)

As shown by Wetherill and Stewart (1989), planetesimal accretion is subject to
positive feedback, which results in runaway growth: the largest bodies grow the
fastest, rapidly detaching themselves from the size distribution of the planetesimals.
The reason for this can be seen from Equation (3.4): dM /dt ∝ M 4/3 , and so the
growth timescale is
tgrow ≡

M
∝ M −1/3 ,
dM /dt

thus larger bodies grow faster than smaller ones.

3.3 The growth of protoplanets

45

Ida and Makino (1993) showed that runaway growth only operates temporarily;
once the largest protoplanets are massive enough to dominate the gravitational
stirring of the nearby planetesimals, the mode of accretion changes. From this
point on, near a protoplanet of mass M , the planetesimal random velocity is
approximately proportional to the surface escape speed from the protoplanet, and
so v ∝ M 1/3 . Therefore, we now have

which makes

Thus growth becomes orderly; larger bodies grow more slowly, and we have the
onset of oligarchic growth (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). In the terrestrial region, the
transition from runaway to oligarchic growth already happens when the largest
protoplanets are still many orders of magnitude below an Earth mass (Thommes
et al., 2003). As a result, protoplanets spend almost all of their time growing
oligarchically.
As long as nebular gas is present, the random velocity v of the planetesimals
is set by two competing effects: gravitational stirring acts to increase v, while
aerodynamic gas drag acts to reduce it. One can estimate the equilibrium random
velocity by equating the two rates (Kokubo and Ida, 1998). In this way, one can
eliminate v and write the protoplanet growth rate (recall that there is essentially
no more planetesimal–planetesimal growth by this time) in terms of planetesimal
and gas disk properties. Also, for simplicity we approximate the planetesimal
population as having a single characteristic mass m. The result is (for details

Protoplanet growth by sweep-up of planetesimals ceases when all planetesimals
are gone. This leads to the notion of the isolation mass, which is the mass at which a
protoplanet has consumed all planetesimals within an annulus of width brH centred
on its orbital radius. The isolation mass is given by

Note that when plsmls ∝ r −2 , Miso is constant with radius from the star; the
increasing gravitational reach at larger distance from the star exactly balances the
falloff in the density of planetesimals. For any shallower surface density proﬁle,
Miso increases with r.
In order to obtain values for protoplanet accretion times and ﬁnal masses, a
useful starting point is the ‘minimum-mass Solar Nebula’(MMSN) model (Hayashi,
1981), which is obtained by ‘smearing out’ the refractory elements contained in the
Solar System planets into a power-law planetesimal disk, then adding gas to obtain
solar abundance:

is the ‘snow line’ solids enhancement factor: beyond rSN (= 2.7 AU in the Hayashi
model), water freezes out, thus adding to the surface density of solids.
Since the exponent of the surface density power law is greater than −2, we know
from Equation (3.10) that the isolation mass will increase with distance from the
star (though from Equation (3.8), the time to ﬁnish growing also increases with r).
Using Equation (3.10) with b = 10, the MMSN yields an isolation mass of 0.07

protoplanets, and a characteristic planetesimal size of ∼1 km (with a corresponding

mass of 10−12 M⊕ ), the growth timescale for an isolation-mass body at 1 AU is
tgrow ≡ M /(dM /dt) ≈ 6 × 104 y. Thus, the sweep-up of planetesimals into
protoplanets proceeds very rapidly in the terrestrial region, concluding long before
the nebular gas dissipates, which takes a few million years (Haisch et al., 2001).
Figure 3.1 plots the solution to Equation (3.8) at different times, showing the
progression of protoplanet growth through the terrestrial region during the ﬁrst
million years of the disk’s lifetime.

3.4 The growth of planets
With the protoplanets (or ‘oligarchs’) now starved of planetesimals, the ﬁnal stage
of terrestrial planet formation requires them to agglomerate with one another.
For this to happen, their orbits have to cross. This is referred to as the giantimpact (or chaotic) phase. We will begin with a description of how this unfolds
in the ‘standard model’, and then touch on some more recent efforts to tie up the
loose ends.
Traditionally, N -body simulations have been the tool of choice for characterizing
the giant-impact phase. The problem is particularly well suited to this approach,
because once all the planetesimals have been locked up in perhaps tens to hundreds
of protoplanets, N is no longer an intractably large number. The ﬁrst direct N -body
calculations (Cox and Lewis, 1980; Lecar and Aarseth, 1986) revealed a number of
key features of the giant-impact phase. They showed that an ensemble of lunar-to

Terrestrial planet formation

Martian-sized bodies, allowed to agglomerate with one another in collisions,
naturally formed Solar-System-like terrestrial planets. They also demonstrated that
this process is highly stochastic. Because only a few bodies remain at the end,
in any single simulation the notion of a characteristic planet mass as a function of
distance from the star becomes meaningless, and the approach we use in Section 3.3
can no longer be applied.
Taken together, the work of Chambers and Wetherill (1998), Agnor et al. (1999),
and Chambers (2001) can be said to delineate the ‘standard model’ of how the
ﬁnal stage of terrestrial planet formation plays out: simulations begin with a
population of 102 –103 lunar- to-Martian-sized protoplanets, the endproducts of
the previous oligarchic growth phase. Different realizations of a particular initial
condition typically vary only by the (randomly-generated) initial orbital phases of
the protoplanets; the stochastic nature of these systems ensures that this is enough
to make the details of the evolution completely different from one simulation to
the next. Nevertheless, averaging over enough simulations, a number of common
features emerge. On a timescale of ∼(1–3) × 108 years, these bodies collide with
each other and accrete to form planetary systems which, on average, resemble the
Solar System’s terrestrial planets in mass, number, and orbital radius. Mercury and
Mars, given their small sizes, seem to ﬁt into the picture as essentially primordial
oligarchs that managed to come through the whole process without undergoing
any major accretional collisions. The spin of each endproduct is dominated by
the last few major impacts on it, and to lowest order is randomly oriented. This
contrasts with the present-day Solar System, in which all terrestrial planet spins are
approximately perpendicular to their orbital plane. However, the obliquities of the
terrestrial planets have evolved signiﬁcantly by processes such as tidal interactions
and spin–orbit coupling, thus their spins are unlikely to be primordial. A more
puzzling issue is that of the ﬁnal orbital eccentricities and inclinations. Their timeaveraged values are almost universally larger (e, i  0.1, for i in radians) than
those of Earth and Venus today (e, i ≈ 0.03) (Chambers and Wetherill, 1998;
Nagasawa et al., 2006).
Because numerical models of late-stage terrestrial planet formation are otherwise
so successful, the problem of reproducing the low e and i of Earth and Venus has
been the subject of much effort; it really is a case of ‘so close and yet so far!’
Considering that we are demanding that the terrestrial region evolve directly from
wildly crossing orbits and giant impacts, to a very quiescent state of nearly circular,
coplanar orbits, this failure is not really surprising. In the most general terms, to
solve this problem an additional, dissipative physical process must be invoked,
which will damp away the planets’ non-circular motions. A number of different
mechanisms have been put forth and, as yet, nothing approaching a consensus
has been reached among theorists. Below, we look at three proposed models.

3.4 The growth of planets

Perhaps the most obvious candidate is the planets’ own leftover building
material. If a signiﬁcant mass in planetesimals is left in the system, this can exert
dynamical friction on the planets (e.g., Wetherill and Stewart (1989)): a population
of gravitationally interacting bodies with different masses evolves toward a state
where the energy in random velocities (relative to circular Keplerian orbits; see
Section 3.3) is the same for all bodies, regardless of mass. This makes smaller
bodies gain eccentricity and inclination at the expense of the larger ones, so that the
latter have their e and i damped. The problem is that the timescale for sweeping up
the planetesimals is, as we saw in Section 3.3, only ∼105 years. Thus, a signiﬁcant
reservoir of planetesimals is unlikely to persist long enough to affect the dynamics
after 108 years or more. Alternatively, a large number of small bodies, right down
to dust size, may be generated collisionally during the planet growth process
(Goldreich et al., 2004).
As long as the nebular gas persists, it also acts as a source of damping for
protoplanet eccentricities and inclinations. Though bodies larger than kilometre size
are not strongly affected by aerodynamic gas drag, their gravitational interaction
with the gas disk can have a signiﬁcant effect on them. Each planet launches density
waves into the interior and exterior part of the disk, exchanging energy and angular
momentum with it. The net result is that planets migrate inward while having their
eccentricities damped (Goldreich and Tremaine, 1980; Artymowicz, 1993; Ward,
1997; Papaloizou and Larwood, 2000). The approximate orbital and eccentricity
decay timescales for a planet of mass M orbiting a star of mass M∗ with initial

Terrestrial planet formation

of ∼7 × 105 y, and has its eccentricity damped on a timescale of ∼2 × 104 y.
Because of this difference in timescales, even when the gas disk has become so
tenuous that only very little planet migration is occurring, the planets can still be
subject to signiﬁcant eccentricity damping.
Kominami and Ida (2002, 2004) performed simulations of this scenario. They
found, ﬁrst of all, that the giant-impact stage tends to be delayed until the
gas is strongly depleted, such that te  106 y, approximately the crossing
time for adjacent oligarchs. Therefore in this scenario, the terrestrial region is
essentially frozen in the end state of oligarchic growth until the gas disk is tenuous
enough that dynamical evolution can resume. Kominami and Ida demonstrated
that low ﬁnal eccentricities of Earth and Venus analogues can be generated in
this way, but ﬁne tuning of the disk properties, speciﬁcally the gas dispersal
time, is required. Even then, on average six–seven bodies are left in the end,
signiﬁcantly more than the present-day number of Solar System terrestrial planets.
The fundamental problem is that making the oligarchs’ orbits cross and damping
their eccentricities are two conﬂicting objectives. Also, they found that including
the gravitational perturbations on the terrestrial region due to Jupiter and Saturn
tended to make the model work more poorly (in the sense that eccentricities and
inclinations became higher), leading them to speculate that the terrestrial planets
might have formed at a time when Jupiter and Saturn had not yet reached their
ﬁnal masses.
Nagasawa et al. (2005) (see also Nagasawa et al. (2006)) developed a model
for late-stage terrestrial planet formation via a large-scale dynamical shakeup.
The model likewise hinges on the dissipating gas disk; however, it also includes
the effect of the gas disk on the precession of all the embedded orbits, with the
result that things play out in a dramatically different way. This is due to the effect
of a secular resonance of Jupiter, a detailed discussion of secular resonances is
given in, e.g., Murray and Dermott (1999). Here, we will restrict ourselves to a
simpliﬁed, qualitative description: A secular resonance between two bodies occurs
(approximately) when the precession frequencies of their orbits are equal. In this
case, we are looking at the precession rate of terrestrial oligarchs relative to that of
Jupiter. The former precess due to the gravitational inﬂuence of the gas disk, Jupiter,
Saturn and, to a lesser extent, each other. Jupiter, meanwhile, is made to precess
by the inﬂuence of Saturn and the gas disk, as well as a small contribution from
the protoplanets themselves. When a given oligarch’s precession matches that of
Jupiter and a resonance occurs, a rapid exchange of angular momentum takes place
between the two bodies. Being much more massive, Jupiter’s orbit undergoes little
change. The orbit of the small protoplanet, however, rapidly gains eccentricity. For
a given gas disk density distribution, there is one particular orbital radius interior
(and exterior, though this plays no role in the model) to Jupiter at which a body

will be in secular resonance. As the gas disk dissipates (through a combination
of accreting onto the star, photoevaporation, and stripping by stellar winds), its
gravitational potential changes and so too do the precession rates of the embedded
(proto)planets and thus the location of the interior secular resonance. The resonance
begins near Jupiter in a massive gas disk, ﬁnally ending up – once the gas is all
gone – at its present-day location at 0.6 AU, just inside the current orbit of Venus
(Lecar and Franklin, 1997; Nagasawa and Ida, 2000). Along the way it thus sweeps
the asteroid belt and much of the terrestrial region and one after another the oligarchs
have their eccentricity sharply raised, thus crossing their neighbours’ orbits. In this
way, the giant-impact phase is kick-started when there is still a signiﬁcant amount
of gas left in the disk. Nagasawa et al. (2005) performed numerical simulations of
this process and found that accretion among oligarchs can ﬁnish rapidly in this way,
leaving enough time for the last remnants of the gas disk to damp the eccentricities
and inclinations of the end products. Another effect in evidence is a net inward
migration of material during the resonance sweeping process, since bodies forced
to high eccentricities in the presence of a damping force lose orbital energy as their
eccentricity is damped again, thus spiralling inward (Lecar and Franklin, 1997). This
offers a way to both clear the asteroid belt region (which is highly depleted relative
to even the MMSN planetesimal disk) and deliver water-rich building material for
the Earth (see Section 3.6).
Parent–daughter pairs of radioactive isotopes can be exploited as chronometers
to trace the timelines of processes in the early Solar System, potentially helping
us to decide among the different formation models. Two such pairs are Hf–W
and U–Pb. For both of these, the parent element is a lithophile that is retained
in silicate reservoirs during planetary accretion, whereas the daughter element is
segregated into the core. Since each of the large late-stage impacts would ‘reset
the clock’ by remixing core and mantle, measurements of relative abundances of
these elements in the Earth can be used to estimate how long ago the giant-impact
phase concluded. It is thought that the last impact was the Moon-forming one
(see Section 3.5). Measurements of Hf–W have been used to derive a growth time
of the Earth ranging from about 15 to 50 My (Yin et al., 2002; Kleine et al., 2002;
Wood and Halliday, 2005), intriguingly similar to the short timescales obtained by
Nagasawa et al. (2005). However, the U–Pb chronometer implies a later formation
time, ∼65–85 My (Halliday, 2004). It may be that U–Pb traces the last stages of
core segregation, while Hf–W traces the time for most of the core to ﬁnish forming
(Sasaki and Abe, 2005). Given the difﬁcult nature of these measurements, it should
not be surprising that the different groups’ results have still not been completely
reconciled with each other. Future developments in this area may yet allow us to
determine with some certainty whether the formation of the terrestrial planets was
rapid or drawn out.

3.5 The origin of the Earth–Moon system
The leading model for the formation of the Moon is that a Mars-mass impactor
struck the proto-Earth, with the Moon accreting out of the resulting debris disk
(Hartmann and Davis, 1975; Cameron and Ward, 1976). This scenario naturally
results in a Moon depleted in volatiles and iron-poor (since the impact would have
preferentially splashed out mantle material from the proto-Earth). The giant-impact
model was explored further via a succession of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) simulations, greatly increasing over time in resolution as computing power
advanced (Benz et al., 1986; Cameron and Benz, 1991; Canup and Asphaug, 2001;
Canup, 2004). As mentioned in Section 3.4, this impact is thought to have been the
last major accretion event in the Earth’s history.
The latest simulations reproduce the Earth–Moon system best with an impactor
just over 0.1 M⊕ striking proto-Earth at about a 45◦ angle. This ejects about a
lunar mass of material exterior to Earth’s Roche radius (the distance inside which
a strengthless, self-gravitating body would be disrupted by Earth’s tidal forces) at
about 3 Earth radii (R⊕ ). The vast majority of this material comes from the impactor
itself. Initially, 10–30% of it is in the form of silicate vapour. The orbital period at the
Roche radius is only about 7 hours, thus subsequent evolution is very fast. Ida et al.
(1997) simulated the accretion of the Moon in the protolunar disk, showing that it
takes between a month and a year to get to a single remaining lunar-mass body. The
Moon’s current orbital radius is ≈ 60 R⊕ , thus its orbit has expanded signiﬁcantly
from the time it formed. This is effected by the Moon’s tidal interaction with the
Earth, which transfers angular momentum from the Earth’s spin to the Moon’s orbit.
Early on, interaction with the last remnants of the protolunar disk likely also made
a large contribution to the outward migration of the Moon (Ward and Canup, 2000).
It has been suggested that the Moon may have actually aided the development
of life on Earth (Benn (2001) and references therein): the Moon stabilizes the
Earth against chaotic obliquity variations, and thus against large variations in
climate. Also, without the Moon-forming impact, Earth may have retained its thick
primordial atmosphere and ended up more similar to Venus. Finally, a more closelyorbiting early Moon would have raised substantial tides on the Earth’s surface,
which may have aided the formation of life in tidal pools.

3.6 Terrestrial planets and life
The term ‘habitable zone’ (HZ) goes back to Huang (1959). The criteria adopted for
what constitutes a potentially life-supporting planet have varied widely. The most
durable has proven to be simply the requirement that liquid water can exist on the
planet surface (Rasool and de Bergh, 1970; Kasting et al., 1988). In fact, ‘Follow

the water!’ has become one of the guiding principles of astrobiology. Kasting et al.
(1993) used a climate model to calculate this zone for stars later than F0, which
have lifetimes exceeding 2 Gy, thus giving life ample time to evolve. The inner edge
of the HZ is set by water loss via photolysis and hydrogen escape; the outer edge
is set by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet by raising its albedo.
For G stars like the Sun, Kasting et al. (1993) conservatively estimated that the
HZ stretches from 0.95 to 1.37 AU. F stars, being hotter, have a more distant HZ,
while later type stars have a closer-in HZ (their Fig. 16). They point out that the
logarithmic width of HZs is approximately constant across stellar types. This is
signiﬁcant because the spacing between adjacent planets ought to be set at least
in part by their Hill radii; since rH ∝ r (Equation (3.1)) this implies (for a given
planetary mass) logarithmic spacing. Thus, the number of planets which ﬁt into an
HZ can be expected to be very roughly constant across stellar types. However, the
closer-in HZ of later type stars does lead to a potential obstacle to life: for M type
stars, planets in the HZ will become tidally locked into synchronous rotation with
the central star over a time less than the star’s age. The resultant eternally-dark
planetary hemisphere would likely be frozen and uninhabitable.
Water is the basis of life on Earth, but tracing the origin of the Earth’s water
is also central to understanding terrestrial planet formation. Most models of the
protosolar nebula have too high a temperature at 1 AU for water to condense
out of the gas (Nagasawa et al. (2006) and references therein). Hence, models of
terrestrial planet formation generally invoke a way to deliver water from reservoirs
at larger heliocentric distances. This idea is supported by the deuterium to hydrogen
(D/H) ratio of the Earth’s oceans, which is many times higher than expected in the
protosolar nebula at 1 AU. Still uncertain is what fraction of such material came
from the asteroid belt (e.g., Morbidelli et al. (2000)) vs the trans-Jupiter region
(e.g., Levison et al. (2001), Lunine et al. (2003), Raymond et al. (2004), Gomes et al.
(2005)), i.e., ‘wet asteroids’ vs comets. Observational evidence appears to favour
the asteroid belt, since the D/H ratio of carbonaceous chondrites is closer to that of
the Earth’s oceans than is that of comets (Balsiger et al., 1995; Meier et al., 1998;
Bockelee-Morvan et al., 1998; Dauphas et al., 2000; Drake and Righter, 2002).
One way to systematically deliver large amounts of icy material from beyond the
snow line to the terrestrial region is via the late-stage formation model of Nagasawa
et al. (2005) outlined in Section 3.4.
The cratering record on the Moon seems to suggest a spike in the impact rate about
700 My after the formation of the Solar System (e.g., Hartmann et al. (2000)). This
cataclysmic event in our early history turns out to be a puzzle from the point of view
of both celestial mechanics and the origin of life. Insofar as the latter is concerned,
there exists some (controversial) carbon isotopic evidence for the existence of life
3.7–3.85 Gy ago (Wells et al. (2003) and references therein), right around the time

Terrestrial planet formation

of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). This is surprising since the LHB is likely
to have sterilized the entire Earth (Sleep et al., 1989). One explanation put forward
by Maher and Stevenson (1988) is that around this time, life might simply have
arisen repeatedly and on fairly short timescales, only to be continuously frustrated
by catastrophic impacts. Thus as soon as the impacts ceased, life arose one last time
and took hold. Another possibility is that life found a way to weather the impacts,
either deep underground or in impact ejecta (Sleep et al., 1998). Such ejecta may
even have seeded life elsewhere in the Solar System, such as Mars – a sort of cosmic
enactment of not having all the eggs in one basket.
From a dynamics point of view, the timing of the LHB has also been the cause
of much study and speculation. As discussed in Section 3.3, the sweep-up of
planetesimals in the terrestrial region proceeds on a timescale well below a million
years. Where, then, do all the impactors for the LHB come from? Several different
scenarios have been proposed. Zappala et al. (1998) suggested the breakup of an
asteroid; however, to provide enough material for the LHB, the asteroid’s size must
have been an order of magnitude greater than Ceres (which, with a diameter of
950 km, is the largest body in the asteroid belt today). Chambers and Lissauer
(2002) showed that an extra planet beyond Mars, perhaps around 2 AU, could
have been the culprit. Such a planet could have become unstable on a 700 My
timescale, become eccentric, and crossed as-yet undepleted planetesimal reservoirs
in the inner asteroid belt. These planetesimals would then have been perturbed
onto orbits crossing the terrestrial region. The chief difﬁculty lies in preserving a
signiﬁcant planetesimal population between 2 AU and Jupiter for this length of
time. Finally, Gomes et al. (2005) devised a model in which the LHB is triggered
directly by Jupiter and Saturn. The giant planets almost certainly underwent a
period of gradual, divergent migration as they exchanged angular momentum via
the scattering of planetesimals (Fernández and Ip, 1996; Hahn and Malhotra, 1999).
Gomes et al. (2005) posited an initially compact conﬁguration for the giant planets,
with Uranus and Neptune between 11 and 15 AU, and Jupiter and Saturn just inside
their 1:2 mean-motion resonance. As the planetesimals are scattered back and forth
among the giant planets they migrate apart, and at the moment when Jupiter and
Saturn cross their 1:2 resonance divergently, both receive a kick in eccentricity,
as previously shown by Chiang et al. (2002). This excitation, then, serves as the
trigger for the LHB, delivering a large ﬂux of planetesimals from the outer disk
onto orbits that cross the terrestrial region. To a lesser extent, material remaining
in the asteroid belt may also participate.
The trick is to make this event happen so late; Gomes et al. (2005) showed
that the timing of the migration can be controlled by the distance between the
outermost giant planet and the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. Since many
planetesimals will have already been accreted or scattered during the giant planets’

formation, a distance of more than 1 AU between the giant planets and the inner
disk edge, as in their best-ﬁt model, is not implausible. However, although this
model constitutes a clever way to obtain an essentially arbitrarily long evolution
followed by a cataclysm, the initial locations of the giant planets need to be rather
ﬁnely tuned, without any obvious cosmogonical justiﬁcation.
In Section 3.4, we looked at one way in which the formation process of terrestrial
planets in the Solar System may have been driven by the dynamical inﬂuence of
Jupiter and Saturn. We now consider other, more general, ways in which giant
planets may affect terrestrial planets, with an emphasis on the issue of habitability.
While Section 3.4 describes a scenario in which the giant planets may help
terrestrial planet formation, it is just as possible for giant planets to hinder the
formation of terrestrial planets. In a mature planetary system, the existence of
a Jovian planet in or near the HZ will make it unlikely terrestrial planets will
have survived in the same region. Even a stable HZ is no guarantee of a friendly
environment for terrestrial planets. During the lifetime of the gas disk in the ﬁrst
few million years, substantial migration of planets, especially giant planets, is likely
to occur due to gravitational planet–disk interactions (Goldreich and Tremaine,
1980; Lin and Papaloizou, 1986; Ward, 1997). Numerous gas giants planets may
in fact be lost during this time by migrating inside a disk gap (‘Type II’ migration)
all the way into the central star (Trilling et al., 2002). If gas giants form by
core accretion (Pollack et al., 1996), growing giant planet cores, ∼10 M⊕ in
mass, likely migrate even faster than gas giants, so that even a system in which
no gas giant ever penetrates the terrestrial region may suffer an early period of
being repeatedly transited by Neptune-sized bodies (Thommes and Murray, 2006).
Dynamical studies do suggest, though, that even under such adverse conditions,
some fraction of the (proto)planets in the terrestrial region can survive (Mandell
and Sigurdsson, 2003; Fogg and Nelson, 2005). Finally, it is worth mentioning that
even in systems where a gas giant ends up right in the HZ, biology may have another
recourse: if the giant has one or more large moons, these may provide a suitable
setting for life to arise. Laughlin et al. (2004) argued that the formation of gas
giants ought to be unlikely around low-mass M dwarfs. They assumed that the disk
mass scales with the stellar mass; this would make for a longer growth timescale
and a lower ﬁnal mass for planets grown about such stars (M ≤ 0.4 M ). If gas
giants grow by core accretion, this makes it less likely that cores of large enough
mass to accrete the requisite massive gas envelope will grow within the time that
the gas disk persists, 10 My (GJ 876, M∗ = 0.3 M , orbited by two planets with
M sin i = 0.6 MJup and 1.9 MJup , is a notable counterexample). However, growing
a terrestrial planet is a much less demanding proposition, and effectively the only
time limit is the age of the system. Thus terrestrial planets ought to still be common
around M dwarfs. In fact, with fewer gas giants to threaten their stability, it is

Terrestrial planet formation

conceivable that terrestrial planets are actually more common on average around
lower-mass stars. Since M dwarfs are by far the most common stars, making up
about 70% by number of the stars in the Galaxy, the total number of HZ-dwelling
terrestrial planets is potentially very high.
Although a system with no giant planets at all may be a safer haven for terrestrial
planet formation and survival, a lack of gas giants may negatively impact the
habitability of the planets which do form, even those that end up in their respective
HZ. In the Solar System, Jupiter intercepts a large fraction of the comet ﬂux which
would otherwise cross the terrestrial region. It is thus often argued that without
such a dynamical barrier, life would never have arisen and survived on our planet,
and that a gas giant exterior to the HZ is an additional necessary condition for
habitability. However, the issue is perhaps not quite as clear-cut as it appears at ﬁrst
glance; after all, Jupiter’s perturbations also play a large role in producing shortperiod comets from the Kuiper belt and long-period comets from the Oort cloud
in the ﬁrst place. In fact, outward scattering of planetesimals by Jupiter plays the
main role in actually building the Oort cloud (Duncan et al., 1987). Quantifying the
difference in comet ﬂux into the HZ of a mature planetary system with and without
exterior gas giants is thus an important area for future work, and one which needs
to be undertaken before we can properly assess the potential for low-mass stars to
harbour life.

3.7 Summary
From the theorist’s perspective of how terrestrial planets form, perhaps the most
important aspect is that it seems to be relatively easy, much more so than making
giant planets. Numerical simulations have no problem producing such bodies in
the inner 1–2 AU of a system. Assuming a disk manages to produce planetesimals
(notwithstanding the problems outlined in Section 3.2), their sweep-up proceeds
rapidly in the terrestrial region, taking typically much less than 1 My. The simplest
scenario, in which the resultant protoplanets then interact and collide in a gasfree environment, results in the formation of Earth-mass planets on a timescale
of ∼108 y for a ‘minimum-mass’ distribution of solid material, i.e., one which
begins with essentially just the mass of the present-day terrestrial planets. This
is because planet formation in the inner few astronomical units is very efﬁcient;
with no systematic migration, almost all of the mass one puts in is built into
planets. Thus terrestrial planet formation is fundamentally a very robust process,
so much so that it may actually be difﬁcult to prevent it from happening in any
given system.
This being said, there are still a number of questions about the details of how
terrestrial planets grew in the Solar System and, by extension, how they form

around other stars. The low eccentricities of Earth and Venus seem to require
processes beyond the standard model. It is certainly possible that these low
eccentricities will turn out to be a peculiarity of the Solar System; eccentricities
< 0.1 are not in general necessary for long-term stability. Neither are they
required for habitability. However, this ‘small detail’ may in fact be pointing to
a fundamentally different course of events in the last stage of formation, such as
the secular-resonance ‘shakeup’ model outlined in Section 3.4. Another puzzle is
the nature of the LHB. What initiated it? Did life survive this event, or did it have
to wait until the end of the LHB to arise? How likely are analogues to the LHB
in other planetary systems? The probable ubiquity of terrestrial planet formation
means that any given star ought to have a good chance of harbouring one in its
HZ. This prospect may be ruined if a giant planet exists close enough to the HZ to
destabilize bodies within it.At the same time, though, the presence of (exterior) giant
planets may be required in order to protect the HZ against comet bombardment.
The HZ is deﬁned by the presence of liquid surface water, but the source of that
water is itself still not fully understood.
The discovery of the ﬁrst extrasolar terrestrial planet will certainly be a
momentous event. Until then, no amount of modelling can change the fact that
our sample size of terrestrial planet systems is one. As with the gas giants,
surprises may await which overturn our currently-held picture of how such
planets form. And, of course, the search for exo-terrestrial planets is made
especially exciting by the possibility that another life-bearing world is waiting to be
discovered.
