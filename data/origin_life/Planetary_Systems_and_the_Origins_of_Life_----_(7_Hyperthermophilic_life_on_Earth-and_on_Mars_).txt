7.1 Introduction
Every living organism is adapted to a speciﬁc growth temperature. In the case
of humans, this is 37 ◦ C and an increase by 5 ◦ C becomes fatal. In the world
of microbes, the growth temperature range is much more diverse: heat lovers
(‘thermophiles’) grow optimally (fastest) at temperatures up to 65 ◦ C (Brock, 1978;
Castenholz, 1979). Since the time of Pasteur, it had been assumed generally that
growing (vegetative) cells of bacteria were killed quickly by temperatures of 80 ◦ C
and above. The Pasteurization technology is based on this observation. In contrast,
during the past few decades, hyperthermophiles (HT; Stetter, 1992) that exhibit
unprecedented optimal growth temperatures in excess of 80 ◦ C have been isolated
(Stetter et al., 1981; Zillig et al., 1981; Stetter, 1982). HT turned out to be very
common in hot terrestrial and submarine environments. In comparing the growth
requirements of these present-day HT with the conditions on ancient Earth, similar
organisms could or even should have existed already by Early Archaean times.
Propelled by impact energy, microbes could have spread in between the planets
and moons of the early Solar System. Is there any evidence for the existence of
microbes at that time? Most likely, yes. But the recognition of ancient microfossils
on the basis of morphology turned out to be difﬁcult, leading to controversy.
Nevertheless, there are chemical traces of life within rocks from Precambrian
deep sea vents (Schopf et al., 1987; Brasier et al., 2002; van Zullen et al.,
2002).
In my research, I search for HT, their environments, properties, and modes of
living. So far, I have gathered a collection of more than 1500 strains of HT, among
them are isolates that survive autoclaving at 121 ◦ C. Whether such organisms are
growing slowly or just surviving at 121 ◦ C is unresolved (Blöchl et al., 1997;
Kasheﬁ and Lovley, 2003; Cowan, 2004).

Hyperthermophilic life on Earth – and on Mars?

7.2 Biotopes
HT form complex communities within water-containing geothermally and
volcanically heated environments situated mainly along terrestrial and submarine
tectonic spreading and subduction zones. Availability of liquid water is a
fundamental prerequisite of life. At an increased boiling point of water (for example
by elevated atmospheric, hydrostatic or osmotic pressure), several HT exhibit
growth temperatures exceeding 100 ◦ C. Due to the presence of reducing gasses
like H2 S and the low solubility of O2 at high temperatures, the biotopes of HT
essentially are oxygen-free (anaerobic). HT have been isolated from terrestrial and
submarine environments.

7.2.1 Terrestrial biotopes

Copyright © 2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Natural terrestrial biotopes of HT are mainly hot springs and sulfur-containing
solfataric ﬁelds (named after Solfatara, Italy), with a wide range of pH values
(pH 0–9) and usually low salinity (0.1–0.5%). Solfataric ﬁelds consist of soils, mud
holes, and surface waters, heated by volcanic exhalations from magma chambers
several kilometres below (Figure 7.1). Very often, solfataric ﬁelds are found close
to active volcanoes and activity increases greatly during eruption phases. The
chemical composition of solfataric ﬁelds is very variable and site-dependent.
Many are rich in iron minerals, like ferric hydroxides and pyrite. Less usual
compounds may be enriched at some sites, with magnetite and arsenic minerals like

realgar and auripigment in Caldera Uzon, Kamchatka. Hydrogen may be formed
either pyrolytically from water or chemically from FeS and H2 S (Drobner et al.,
1990). Steam within the solfataric exhalations is responsible mainly for the heat
transfer. In addition, sites may contain carbon dioxide, variable amounts of H2 ,
methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and traces of nitrate and ammonia. Active
volcanoes may harbour hot-water lakes, which are heated by fumaroles. Usually,
those abound in sulfur and are very acidic. Other suitable biotopes for HT are
deep, subterranean, geothermally heated oil stratiﬁcations, approximately 3500 m
below the bottom of the North Sea and the surface of the permafrost soil at the
North Slope, Northern Alaska (Stetter et al., 1993). The ﬂuids produced in these
regions contained up to 107 viable cells per litre of different species of HT. Artiﬁcial
biotopes include smouldering coal refuse piles and hot outﬂows from geothermal
and nuclear power plants.

7.2.2 Marine biotopes
Marine biotopes of HT consist of various hydrothermal systems situated at shallow
to abyssal depths. Similar to ambient seawater, submarine hydrothermal systems
usually contain high concentrations of NaCl and sulfate and exhibit a slightly
acidic to alkaline pH (5.0–8.5). Otherwise, the major gases and life-supporting
mineral nutrients can be similar to those in terrestrial thermal areas. Shallow
submarine hydrothermal systems are found in many parts of the world, mainly on
beaches with active volcanism, like at Vulcano Island, Italy, with temperatures of
80 to 105 ◦ C.
Most impressive are the deep sea ‘smoker’ vents (Figure 7.2), where mineralladen hydrothermal ﬂuids with temperatures up to approximately 400 ◦ C escape
into the cold (2.8 ◦ C), surrounding deep sea water and build up huge rock chimneys.
Although these hot ﬂuids are sterile, the surrounding porous smoker rock material
appears to contain very steep temperature gradients, which provide zones of suitable
growth temperatures for HT. Some smoker rocks are teeming with HT (for example
108 cells of Methanopyrus per gram of rock inside a Mid Atlantic Snake Pit hot
vent chimney). Deep sea vents are located along submarine tectonic fracture zones
(for example the ‘TAG’ and ‘Snake Pit’ sites situated at the Mid Atlantic Ridge in a
depth of about 4000 m). Another type of submarine high temperature environment
is provided by active sea mounts. Close to Tahiti, there is a huge abyssal volcano,
Macdonald Seamount (28◦ 58.7 S, 140 ◦ 15.5 W), the summit of which is situated
approximately 40 meters below the sea surface. Samples taken during an active
phase from the submarine eruption plume and rocks from the active crater contained
high concentrations of viable HT (Huber et al., 1990).

7.3 Sampling and cultivation
Samples of possible HT containing hot waters, soils, rock and sediments may serve
as primary material to set-up enrichment cultures in the laboratory. Special care has
to be taken to avoid contamination of the sample by oxygen. In the presence of high
temperatures of growth, it is toxic to anaerobic HT. In contrast, at low temperatures
(for example: 4 ◦ C) in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic HT may survive for years.
Transportation and shipping can be performed at ambient temperature. In the lab,
anaerobic samples (in tightly stoppered 100 ml storage bottles and stored at 4 ◦ C)
can be used for successful enrichment cultures at least for 10 years.
Enrichment cultures can be obtained by simulating the varying geochemical and
geophysical composition of the environments. Various plausible electron donors
and acceptors may be used under anaerobic, microaerophilic, or aerobic culture
conditions. Depending on the (unknown) initial cell concentration and the doubling
time of the organism, positive enrichment cultures of HT can be identiﬁed by
microscopy within 1–7 days. For a deeper understanding of the organisms, the
study of pure cultures is required. Due to the high incubation temperatures, the
traditional manner of cloning by plating does not perform well in HT (even by
using heat stable polymers like Gelrite). Therefore, we developed a new procedure
for cloning single cells under the laser microscope, by employing optical tweezers
(Ashkin and Dziedzic, 1987; Huber et al., 1995). Large cell masses are required for
biochemical and biophysical investigations. For mass culturing of HT, a new type
of high temperature fermentor was invented in collaboration with an engineering

company (Figure 7.3). Its steel casing is enamel-protected in order to resist the
highly corrosive culture conditions. Sharp-edged parts like stirrers, gasing and
sampling pipes and condensers are made of titanium. The cell yield of a 300 l
fermentation may vary from approximately 3 g to 2 kg (wet weight), depending on
the HT isolate.

7.4 Phylogenetic implications
Hot volcanic environments are among the oldest biotopes existing on Earth. What
is known about the phylogenetic relationships of the organisms living there? Based
on the pioneering work of Carl Woese, the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ss-rRNA)
is widely used in phylogenetic studies of prokaryotes (Woese and Fox, 1977; Woese
et al., 1990). It consists of approximately 1500 nucleotides and is homologous to
its eukaryotic counterpart. On the basis of sequence comparisons, a phylogenetic
tree is now available (Figure 7.4). It shows a tripartite division of the living world
into the bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryal domains. Within this tree, deep branches
are evidence for early separation. The separation of the Bacteria from the stem
shared by Archaea and Eukarya represents the deepest and earliest branching
point. Short phylogenetic branches indicate a rather slow rate of evolution.
In contrast to the eukaryal domain, the bacterial and archaeal domains within the
phylogenetic tree exhibit some extremely short and deep branches. Surprisingly,

those are covered exclusively by hyperthermophiles, which therefore form a cluster
around the phylogenetic root (Figure 7.4, bulky lineages). The deepest and shortest
phylogenetic branches are represented by the Aquiﬁcales and Thermotogales within
the Bacteria and the Nanoarchaeota, Pyrodictiaceae, and Methanopyraceae within
the Archaea. Long lineages represent mesophilic and moderately thermophilic
Bacteria and Archaea (e.g., Gram-positives, Proteobacteria; Halobacteriales;
Methanosarcinaceae) indicating their ss-rRNA had experienced a fast rate of
evolution. Now, several total genome sequences are available. Phylogenetic
trees based on genes involved in information management (for example, DNA
replication, transcription, translation) parallel the ss-rRNA tree. Genes involved in
metabolism, however, are prone to frequent lateral gene transfer, and a network
rather than a tree might reﬂect their phylogenetic relations (Doolittle, 1999).

7.5 Physiologic properties

141

To date, approximately 90 species of HT Archaea and Bacteria, which had been
isolated from different terrestrial and marine thermal areas in the world, are known.
HT are very divergent, both in their phylogeny and physiological properties and
are grouped into 34 genera and 10 orders (Boone and Castenholz, 2001).

7.5 Physiologic properties
7.5.1 Energy sources

Copyright © 2007. Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

Most species of HT exhibit a chemolithoautotrophic mode of nutrition. Inorganic
redox reactions serve as energy sources (chemolithotrophic), and CO2 is the
only carbon source required to build up organic cell material (autotrophic).
Therefore, these organisms ﬁx CO2 by chemosynthesis and are designated
chemolithoautotrophs. The energy-yielding reactions in chemolithoautotrophic HT
are those involved in anaerobic and aerobic respiration (Figure 7.5). Molecular
hydrogen serves as an important electron donor. Other electron donors are sulﬁde,
sulfur, and ferrous iron. As in mesophilic respiratory organisms, in some HT,
oxygen may serve as an electron acceptor. In contrast, however, oxygen-respiring
HT are usually microaerophilic and, therefore, grow only at reduced oxygen
concentrations. Anaerobic respiration types are the nitrate-, sulfate-, sulfur- and
carbon dioxide-types. While chemolithoautotrophic HT produce organic matter,
there are some HT that depend on organic material as energy and carbon
sources. They are designated as heterotrophs. Several chemolithoautotrophic HT
are opportunistic heterotrophs. These are able to use organic material alternatively
to inorganic nutrients whenever they are available from the environment (e.g., by

7.5.2 General physiologic properties
HT are adapted to environmental factors including composition of minerals and
gases, pH, redox potential, salinity and temperature. Similar to mesophiles, they
grow within a temperature range of about 25–30 ◦ C between the minimal and
maximal growth temperature (Table 7.1). Fastest growth is obtained at their optimal
growth temperature, which may be up to 106 ◦ C. Generally, HT do not propagate
at 50 ◦ C or below. Although unable to grow at the low ambient temperatures, they
are able to survive for years. Based on their simple growth requirements, HT could
grow on any hot, wet place, even on other planets and moons of our solar system,
like Mars and Europa. Today, the surface of Mars is too cold and contains no liquid
water and therefore is hostile to life as it is known on Earth. However, in a depth
of a few kilometres below the permafrost layer, there may be hot liquid water and
nutrients to support growth of HT. Life could have spread onto Mars via meteorites
during the great bombardment, about 4 GA ago. At that time, the surface of Mars
had been much hotter and contained liquid water, therefore being favourable to HT.

7.6 Examples of recent HT organisms
Within the Bacteria domain, the deepest phylogenetic branch is represented
by the HT Aquifex (Huber et al., 1992). Its type species Aquifex pyrophilus
is a motile rod-shaped chemolithoautotroph (Figure 7.6). It is a facultative
microaerophilic anaerobe. Under anaerobic conditions, Aquifex pyrophilus grows

by nitrate reduction with H2 and S0 as electron donors. Alternatively, at very low
oxygen concentrations (up to 0.5%, after adaptation), it is able to gain energy by
oxidation of H2 and S0 , using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Members of Aquifex
are found in shallow submarine vents. Aquifex pyrophilus grows up to 95 ◦ C, the
highest growth temperature observed within the Bacteria (Table 7.1).
From the walls of a black smoker at the Mid Atlantic Ridge, we had isolated
the archaeon Pyrolobus fumarii (Blöchl et al., 1997). Cells are lobed cocci,
approximately 0.7–2.5 µm in diameter (Figure 7.7). The species Pyrolobus fumarii
is adapted optimally to temperatures of superheated water, exhibiting an optimal
growth temperature of 106 ◦ C (Figure 7.8) and an upper temperature border of
growth at 113 ◦ C. It is so dependent to high temperatures that it is unable to grow
below 90 ◦ C. Cultures of Pyrolobus fumarii, similar to Pyrodictium occultum are
able to survive autoclaving for one hour at 121 ◦ C. A very closely related isolate
(‘strain 121’) exhibits the same optimal growth temperature (106 ◦ C), but has been
reported to grow slowly even at 121 ◦ C (Kasheﬁ and Lovley, 2003). However, this
result has not been conﬁrmed.

host, a new member of the genus Ignicoccus (Figure 7.9). Owing to their unusual
ss-rRNA sequence, members of Nanoarchaeum equitans remained undetectable by
commonly used ‘universal’ primers in ecological studies based on the polymerase
chain reaction. However, two different ss-rRNA genes could be detected in
a coculture-derived DNA by Southern blot hybridization, by taking advantage
of the generally high sequence homology of all ss-rRNA genes (about 75%
similarity). After sequencing of the total genome, the phylogenetic relationships
of Nanoarchaeum equitans could be investigated by concatenating and aligning
the amino acid sequences of 35 ribosomal proteins (Waters et al., 2003). The
species Nanoarchaeum equitans was placed with high support at the most deeply
branching position within the Archaea, suggesting that the Nanoarchaeota diverged
early within the Archaea. With only 490 885 base pairs, the Nanoarchaeum
equitans genome is the smallest microbial genome known to date and also the
most compact, with 95% of the DNA predicted to encode proteins and stable
RNAs. It harbours the complete machinery for information processing and repair,
but lacks genes for lipid, cofactor, amino acid, and nucleotide biosynthesis. The
limited biosynthetic and catabolic capacity suggests that the symbiotic relationship
of Nanoarchaeum equitans to its Ignicoccus hospitalis host may be parasitic,
making it the only known archaeal parasite. Unlike the small genomes of bacterial
parasites, however, which are undergoing reductive evolution, the small genome
of Nanaoarchaeum equitans has very few pseudogenes and a well-equipped DNA
recombination system. Therefore, it may be a very ancient parasite. Alternatively,
the Ignicoccus hospitalis–Nanoarchaeum equitans system could be remains

from pre-Archaea communities, as postulated earlier (Kandler, 1994). At the
molecular level, Nanoarchaeum equitans harbours further unexpected, most likely
primitive properties, like separately encoded enzyme modules and – for the ﬁrst
time – t RNA gene fragments (Waters et al., 2003; Randau et al., 2005). Currently,
we possess only rudimentary understanding of the Nanoarchaeum equitans –
Ignicoccus hospitalis relationship. The Nanoarchaeota are distributed world-wide
within hot environments and had been completely overlooked. Two ss-rRNA

Park (USA) exhibited 83% sequence similarity to Nanoarchaeum equitans, and,
therefore, represent a distinct group within the Nanoarchaeota (Hohn et al.,
2002). Light microscopy and ﬂuorescence in situ staining reveal that these novel
Nanoarchaeota are again tiny cocci, approximately the size of Nanoarchaeum
equitans, however, attached to a rod-shaped Pyrobaculum-like host. The discovery
of the Nanoarchaeota suggests that further unrecognized major groups of microbes
may remain undetected by current PCR primers and are waiting for isolation to tell
us more about the origins and evolution of life.
