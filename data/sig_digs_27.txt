7 percent
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui O.S.K. and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha are merging container operations. They’re the three largest shipping companies in Japan, and by the time the deal is done by July the combined company will run 256 ships and 7 percent of the world shipping market by volume. [The New York Times]

23 penalties
The Oakland Raiders set a new NFL record Sunday for penalties in a single game, racking up 23 that cost them 200 yards. The good news? They were going up against the Tampa Bay Bucs, so they won anyway. [ESPN]

42 years
A man who checked out William Shirer’s “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich” in April 1974 from the Guilderland Library returned the book last Tuesday. The late fee for such a wait would be $3,106.20, but a man such as this presumably knows to live a life on the run, dodging the law and other library enforcement authorities, and presumably set up the book drop up so they’d be sipping a cocktail on a brach in Zihuatanejo, Mexico by the time anyone was all the wiser to his escape from New York. [NBC New York]

76 percent
The Chicago Cubs saved their chances of winning the World Series by winning Game 5 of the seven-game series Sunday night. The Cleveland Indians are one game away from winning the series, the Cubs need two wins, and they’re rather evenly matched. The FiveThirtyEight MLB Elo model gives Cleveland a 76 percent chance of winning it all and the Cubs a 24 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

$10 million
Donald Trump has put a further $10 million into his campaign in the last days before election day, making his total investment in his bid for the presidency more than $66 million. As of two weeks ago, the campaign only had $16 million on hand. [POLITICO]

$70 million
A California woman was awarded $70 million after bringing a lawsuit claiming that Johnson & Johnson was negligent in making its talcum powder, arguing it caused her ovarian cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer said that using talc on genitals is potentially cancer-causing, but the science appears not to be definitive quite yet. [CBS News]

7 donors
The National Sperm Bank of the U.K. stopped accepting new donors because of funding issues. Only seven men have signed on successfully. [BBC]

22L
GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence’s chartered plane skidded off runway 22L Thursday night after a hard landing at La Guardia Airport in New York City. All 37 passengers and 11 crew members are fine, but the runway is a bit torn up. [ABC 7 NY]

40 percent
Percentage of female members of parliament interviewed by an Inter-Parliamentary Union study who reported receiving threats of death, rape and more while serving their term. The survey included 55 female members of 39 countries’ legislatures. [The Guardian]

49 percent
Percentage of white Catholic women supporting Hillary Clinton in a new survey of likely voters from PRRI; 58 percent of white Catholic men supported Donald Trump. The gender gap in terms of support for Trump is larger for white Catholics than for white mainline or evangelical Protestants, the survey found. [PRRI]

Over 50 gigabits
The last of the data from the New Horizons spacecraft’s flyby of Pluto was delivered to scientists at 5:48 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday. The spacecraft took in a ton of data quickly on its flyby in July 2015 and sent the final piece home from more than 3.1 billion miles away. [New Horizons]

$42 billion to $45.5 billion
Amazon is gearing up for the holiday season and said Thursday that it expects $42 billion to $45.5 billion in sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected that figure to be $44.6 billion. [Bloomberg]

6 medal winners
Nine athletes, six of whom won medals, were disqualified from the 2008 Beijing Olympics after their doping samples were retested and failed. [ESPN]

17 percent
Aircraft passengers seem to be getting more unruly. There were 10,854 incidents in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association, up almost 17 percent from the year before. [The Wall Street Journal]

19 percent
The NFL has TV viewership issues right now, and there are a whole lot of potential reasons for that. But viewership of English Premier League soccer matches is also down 19 percent, so this could be a broader issue. [The New York Times]

62 percent
Look, when I signed up for this gig, I realized a lot of things could happen. Couple years back, if you’d told me, “Yeah, Dallas and the Eagles will fight to lead the division,” I’d say, sure, worse things have happened to better people. If you said, “There is a show about Luke Cage,” I’d revel in our good fortune but realize we’ll still never get the Hawkeye show we deserve. If you told me, “Donald Trump will win several states in his bid for the presidency,” I’d say, sure, while difficult to comprehend, that’s possible. But if you told me that the Chicago Cubs — the team that last won the championship when the Ottoman Empire was still kicking — had a 62 percent chance of winning the World Series, I’d say you were full of crap. And yet here we stand. [FiveThirtyEight]

85.7 percent
Probability that Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, according to the FiveThirtyEight polls-only model. If you want to know how Trump might win, by golly, we have that too. [FiveThirtyEight]

3,800
This year at least 3,800 people have died crossing the Mediterranean Sea to try to reach Europe, a grim new record, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. [CNN]

Number of fundraisers for Trump Victory — a joint committee of the Republican Party and Donald Trump’s campaign — scheduled between now and Election Day. The committee’s last formal fundraiser was the day of the final debate. On the Democrats’ side, Hillary Clinton had her last fundraiser Tuesday in Miami, with 41 more events featuring surrogates to come. [The Washington Post]

1 night only!
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg will make her speaking debut at the opera Nov. 12 with a production of “The Daughter of the Regiment” in Washington. [New York Daily News]

14.8 percent
Chipotle hasn’t recovered from its E. coli outbreak a year ago, with revenue dropping 14.8 percent in the third quarter and net income cratering to $7.8 million from $144.9 million in the same quarter last year. [Business Insider]

10,015,480
Many of us still have two weeks of election to go. But 10 million others can put this wonderful experience behind them. That’s how many early ballots had been cast as of Tuesday night. They are the lucky ones. [U.S. Elections Project, FiveThirtyEight]

$22 million
That’s how much the Clinton campaign and its allies are spending in battleground states this week, compared to $9.8 million from the Trump camp and its allies. Ah, now those fundraising numbers from earlier make sense. In Florida alone this week, Clinton and her allies are spending $7.4 million to Camp Trump’s $3.6 million. [NBC News]

$100 million
CNN will make roughly $100 million more in TV and digital advertising revenue this year than it would expect in a typical election year. I wonder why! [NPR]

3 plays
The Oxford University Press, after an extensive analysis, will credit Christopher Marlowe as a co-author on three Shakespeare plays. The three plays in the “Henry VI” trilogy will be credited to Marlowe and Shakespeare, and if you want to know more, we try to keep things tight here, but believe me, your friend who did a lot of plays in college has a very, very, very strong opinion about this, so hit them up. [The Associated Press]

15 percent
Although it fluctuates, that’s roughly where FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only model has Donald Trump’s chances of winning the presidential race. That’s a little more bullish on the Republican’s chances than other models, and that’s because of the model’s design. If we ignored the large number of undecided votes, Trump’s chances would be 10 percent; if we calibrated the model since 2000 rather than 1972, his chances would be about 5 percent; and if we assumed states moved independently rather than having some correlation in error, that would give him less than a 1 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 percent
Health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act will rise an average of 22 percent in 2017, according to new estimates, though tax credits track with the rise in premiums. About 70 percent of people buying insurance in Obamacare marketplaces could get a plan that costs less than $75 per month in 2017, the Obama administration said. [NPR]

42 days, 6 hours, 30 minutes
Pete Kostelnick has set a world record for fastest run across America; the 29-year-old ran the 3,067 miles from San Francisco’s City Hall to New York’s in just more than 42 days. The previous record was set in 1980 at 46 days, 8 hours, 36 minutes. [Runner’s World]

76 percent
Sell-through rate of Donald Trump Halloween masks, a notch above the 69 percent for Hillary Clinton masks, according to the Savers/Value Village thrift store. I am going as “Sexy Evan McMullin” for Halloween, a costume that will only be recognized in Utah and will not be received well at all. [AOL News]

2 million copies
SAG-AFTRA video game voiceover artists are on strike! The union wants bonuses for its performers for every 2 million copies sold, up to 8 million copies. On average, voice actors in video games make $825.50 for a four-hour session. [Motherboard]

10 times
The Chicago Cubs are going to the World Series for the first time since 1945. The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, when there was still an Ottoman Empire. Moreover, their victory in the National League Championship Series means the L.A. Dodgers are not going to the World Series. This is the 10th consecutive time that the Dodgers have made the postseason without making it to the World Series, a first in professional baseball! History made by both teams. [ESPN]

13.7 percent
In a typical election year, Utah should pretty much be a lock for the GOP. But it is not a typical year, and Republican Donald Trump has a 77.2 percent chance of winning Utah, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Nine percent of FiveThirtyEight simulations see Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the state, but 13.7 percent have it going to independent conservative Evan McMullin, a candidate previously so unknown that the web publishing platform where I’m writing this still considers his last name a typo. [FiveThirtyEight]

37.5 cents
On Nov. 1, the per-gallon gasoline tax rate in New Jersey will jump from 14.5 cents — one of the lowest in the nation — to 37.5 cents, one of the highest, to fix the state’s road system. The hike was signed into law Oct. 14, and two state senators are already trying to repeal it. [NJ.com]

500,000
The Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals estimates that there are a half-million feral and stray cats hanging around New York City, and having them here is apparently worth the horrifying cat sex noises I hear outside my apartment regularly. The cat colonies keep rodent populations down, and groups of them have been deployed to rat-heavy areas. [The Associated Press]

$85.4 billion
AT&T Inc. has agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. — home of CNN, HBO, DC Comics and more — for $85.4 billion, pending regulator approval. [Bloomberg]

7 months
The Environmental Protection Agency should have issued an emergency order protecting the citizens of Flint, Michigan, seven months earlier then it actually did, the agency’s Inspector General said. The EPA finally issued an order on the city’s lead-tainted water in January 2016. [NPR]

22 percent
Percentage of pro-Clinton Twitter traffic during the first presidential debate that was derived from bots and automated accounts. That might seem like a lot until you learn that bots accounted for 33 percent of pro-Trump’s traffic. [CNN]

60 percent
Percentage of Americans who support legalizing marijuana, a record high according to a Gallup poll. When the question was first broached by Gallup in 1969, 12 percent of Americans were down with the ganj’. Several states are voting on cannabis-related issues this coming Election Day. [PBS]

The Tennessee Valley Authority officially switched on the second reactor at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. The reactor, which has been under construction since the seventies, is the first to open in the U.S. since 1996. [CNN]

1.5 million
There were 24,000 cases of syphilis, 400,000 cases of gonorrhea, and 1.5 million cases of chlamydia in the U.S. in 2015. I still cannot remember which one of these is “the clap,” but syphilis is definitely the hardest to spell. [Quartz]

It’s debate night! FiveThirtyEight will be liveblogging the whole shebang, and I’ll be on ABC News Live in the pre-show this evening. Check them out!

3 of 5
The Florida Keys and the community of Key Haven, Florida, will vote in referendums on whether to introduce genetically modified mosquitoes into a test area in an attempt to reduce the population of Aedes aegypti, the species that transmits the Zika virus. While the resolution is non-binding, three of the five members of the Mosquito Control Board have agreed to comply with the plebiscite. [FiveThirtyEight]

+7.1 points
Mitt Romney won the South by 7.1 points over Barack Obama in 2012. Donald Trump is winning in the South too, but by a mere 1.2 points. This is typified by Texas, where Donald Trump is leading by a rather slim margin for a Republican. A University of Houston poll has him up a mere 3 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

90 years old
Legendary rock musician Chuck Berry announced Tuesday that he will release his first album in 38 years. Tuesday also happens to have been Berry’s 90th birthday. Think about that next time you’re not feeling up to completing a creative task you set out to do. [The Guardian]

1987
A U.S. warship next month will visit New Zealand for the first time in three decades. In 1987, New Zealand passed a law banning ships that are powered by nuclear reactors or that carry nuclear weapons. The U.S. won’t confirm or deny the nuclear capabilities of its fleet, so the Navy hasn’t been there since. [ABC News]

$1 million
Election Day is still nearly three weeks away, but Paddy Power, an Irish bookmaker, announced that it is so confident that Hillary Clinton will win the U.S. election that it will pay out more than $1 million in winnings for bets made on her victory. [PaddyPower]

2,064,538
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will face one another in their final presidential debate tonight. But the debate comes too late to change the minds of at least 2,064,538 confirmed voters.

Game 3 of the National League Championship Series and Game 4 of the American League Championship Series are both tonight.

$382,000
Based on a study from the Center for Public Integrity, about 430 people who work in journalism have donated a combined $382,000 to Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency. (The tally included donations from critics and others who don’t cover political news.) An estimated 96 percent of contributions from journalists went to Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump, who has received about $14,000. [Columbia Journalism Review]

$36.4 million
Are you in the market for a never-finished nuclear power plant from the seventies? Has Alabama got some good news for you, weirdo. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal utility, has put an incomplete Alabama nuclear plant up for auction, with bids starting at $36.4 million. The TVA spent more than $5 billion over 40 years building the twin-reactor plant, which the local mayor says is 90 percent complete. [Newser]
