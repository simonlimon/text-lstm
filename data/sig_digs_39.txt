Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

57 percent
Percentage of Americans who disagree with legislation mandating which bathrooms transgender people may use, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Republicans — members of the party that has been proposing this legislation — are split on the matter, with 48 percent both for and against. [The Washington Post]

63 percent
Percentage of Americans who do not believe in UFOs, according to an Associated Press poll. Hillary Clinton is apparently not among that number, and she has promised to open up government files on UFOs if elected president. “There’s enough stories out there that I don’t think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up,” she said in a recent radio interview. [The New York Times, FiveThirtyEight]

131 votes
For the first time ever, the MVP of the NBA was selected unanimously: Steph Curry won all 131 first-place votes. [SFGate]

1,284 planets
The Kepler mission to find new worlds has found another batch of planets, NASA announced Tuesday. This time it’s 1,284 new planets, bringing the total found by the Kepler space telescope to 2,325. Uh, maybe Clinton’s got a point with that whole alien thing. [NASA]

20,000
Conservative estimate for the number of mercenaries working around the globe who are from Uganda. The nation is a major source of private security personnel, whose employment ranges from guarding banks and malls at home to protecting American diplomats in Iraq. [Bloomberg]

$13 billion
The top 25 hedge fund managers pulled in a collective $13 billion last year, with Kenneth Griffin of Citadel and James Simons of Renaissance Technologies receiving the highest individual compensation. [Reuters]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

63 percent
West Virginia votes in its presidential primary today, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is the 63 percent favorite to win on the Democratic side, according to our polls-plus forecast. On the Republican side, who really cares? That ship has sailed. [FiveThirtyEight]

90 percent
Percentage of Alaska general fund revenue that comes from oil. With oil vastly cheaper now than it was several years ago, the state is facing a substantial fiscal problem. [Bloomberg]

717 Republicans
Number of people who have filed to run for Congress and recorded donations on the GOP side this cycle, compared to 577 Democrats. This isn’t vastly out of line with previous cycles, suggesting that whatever is happening at the top of the ticket, we aren’t seeing a Trump-like assault from party outsiders in down-ballot races. [FiveThirtyEight]

$62.8 million
Cost of a high school football stadium in McKinney, Texas, that the school board just approved. There will be 12,000 seats, which seems patently absurd to this life-long East Coaster. [Sports Illustrated]

$1.35 billion
Krispy Kreme has been acquired by JAB Holding for $1.35 billion, presumably glazed. The holding company also owns Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, so it seems like it has the coffee-and-doughnut market pretty much cornered. [CNN]

6 worst weeks
With the rise in availability of cheap natural gas, U.S. coal production has taken a massive hit. One stat really drives home how bad it has gotten: The six worst weeks for coal production (excluding holiday weeks) have all happened this year! [Inside Energy]

42 years old
Bartolo Colon, a professional baseball player for the New York Mets, hit his first-ever home run, at the age of 42, this past weekend. [ESPN]

56 percent
Residents of Austin, Texas, voted 56 percent against a proposal put forward by the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft seeking to skirt laws requiring fingerprint background checks for drivers, among other regulations. The vote is a legal setback for the companies, and like many hipsters before them, they’re threatening to leave Austin. [USA Today]

80 percent
Percentage of polled Americans who said the Islamic State was their top international concern. [Bloomberg]

687 percent
Canada is just lousy with syphilis right now — which is a sentence I never realized I desperately wanted to write — and is facing a shortage of drugs to confront the problem. The number of annual syphilis cases nationally jumped to 3,266 in 2013 from 475 in 1998, a 687 percent jump over 15 years. [Global News]

More than 325,000 podcasts
The number of podcasts available through Apple’s podcast services. That’s a real credit to the boom in podcasting in recent years, but there are some problems. The popularity of podcasting poses a headache for Apple, which has not signaled an abundant interest in maintaining the community, and podcasters appear to be rudderless when it comes to navigating interactions with the company. [The New York Times]
CORRECTION (9 a.m., May 9): An earlier version of this article misstated the role of pitchers in the National League. They bat regularly in National League stadiums; they do not bat only during inter-league games.

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

5 cents
The New York City Council voted Thursday to implement a 5 cent fee on carryout bags with a few exceptions. I can only imagine this is exceptional news for local NPR affiliate WNYC, which can finally get more of those fly tote bags into the wild now. [The New York Times]

12 hours
That’s the big sell of OxyContin, or at least it was: pain relief for 12 hours. But despite the claim, the lack of consistent results for many patients led to over-prescribing or increased doses, which in turn has in part led to an opiate epidemic that has claimed 190,000 lives since 1999. [Los Angeles Times]

18 years old
The Food and Drug Administration has banned the sale of electronic cigarettes to people under the age of 18, marking the first major federal regulatory actions on the product. The person who seems to walk ahead of me on my commute every morning was unavailable for comment. [The Washington Post]

20 films
Number of films Hollywood will release in 2016 that contain a colon in their title. “Captain America: Civil War” is 5 percent of that, for those counting at home. [The Wrap]

58
President Obama announced that he will commute the sentences of 58 federal inmates incarcerated for drug crimes. [The Hill]

81 percent
Based on a series of thousands of crowdsourced matchups, some quick modeling and a whole bunch of simulations, I estimate that Team Iron Man would defeat Team Cap about 81 percent of the time based on the assorted strength ratings of each squad. This is largely due to Captain America’s mediocre recruitment, as he would only lose to Iron Man about 60 percent of the time in one-on-one matchups. Applying sports analytics to comic book characters is not where I expected my career to go, but I’m cool with this. [FiveThirtyEight]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

1 state
John Kasich suspended his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination on Wednesday, ceding victory to Donald Trump. Kasich managed the impressive feat of remaining in the race longer than any other losing contender while somehow winning only a single state (Ohio) and accumulating a mere 154 delegates — a figure that was lower than the delegate count for Marco Rubio, who halted his campaign in the middle of March. [CNBC]

25 grams per week
Tea consumption per week per capita in the U.K. in 2014, down from 68 grams in 1974. Tea appears to be the victim of a generational divide, as the former staple of the British diet is not as popular among younger folks. [The Washington Post]

26 years old
The NHL’s Arizona Coyotes will name John Chayka the team’s GM today, making the 26-year-old stathead the youngest GM in the league. Is this the stats-in-sports bubble bursting? Who can say. [USA Today]

1857
That’s the last time a big earthquake seriously rocked the southern portion of the San Andreas fault line, and seismologists are worried about built-up stress on the fault line busting out in a destructive way. [The Los Angeles Times]

66,602
Number of passenger elevators in New York City. At any given time, based on the upwards of 76,000 total elevators and the average weight restriction, about 18 percent of the city’s population could potentially be held up by the five boroughs’ elevators if we ever elected to give that a whirl. [FiveThirtyEight]

$240,000
An economics professor has estimated that resellers of tickets to “Hamilton” — the hottest show on Broadway — make $240,000 per week in aggregate. “Hamilton” speculation is a brisk business in the city. [Bloomberg]

1 sanctioned athlete
Not even the rough-and-tumble world of competitive tug of war has escaped doping scandals: The World Anti-Doping Association has processed 107 drug tests for the sport, one of which led to a sanction. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 years
Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly speaker, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a corruption case. He’ll also face a $1.75 million fine and will forfeit $5.3 million in ill-gotten gains. Somehow, six of the last seven New York state legislative majority leaders have been convicted on criminal charges. [ABC New York]

16 nominations
“Hamilton,” that awesome play none of us will ever get tickets to but still play on Spotify nonstop, has been nominated for a record 16 Tony Awards. Also, we kept ol’ Hambone on the $10 bill, so he’s doing pretty OK right now. [Vulture]

32
Number of people kidnapped by pirates this year so far compared to 15 in all of last year. With ransoms up to $400,000, it’s brisk business for hijackers, according to the Oceans Beyond Piracy group. [BBC]

53%
With 53 percent of the vote statewide, Donald Trump has won the Indiana Republican primary and, barring a major shift in the forthcoming states, has become the presumptive nominee of the GOP. Also, Sen. Ted Cruz has dropped out. Wow. [ABC News]

1 million condoms
New York City is sending Puerto Rico 1 million NYC-branded condoms to combat the spread of the Zika virus. [New York Magazine]

0
The NSA and FBI sent 1,457 electronic surveillance order requests to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2015. Of those, zero were denied. The secret court did modify 80 of them, up from 19 in 2014, so we have that going for us. [Reuters]

1st place
Leicester City F.C. — which I’ve come to understand is essentially the Chicago Cubs of Premier League soccer, yet somehow worse? — has clinched the title! This was considered a delirious long shot by oddsmakers at the beginning of the season — some gambling houses were offering 5,000-to-1 odds on them winning the title — which means that fans are thrilled and bookies are very screwed. [Digg]

25 alarms
Do you want to be more like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson? I know how many of you read our stories about his obscene cod-focused diet, so I know the answer is “god, absolutely, get on with it, Walt, how do I be more like Dwayne”The Rock” Johnson?” Well, besides being a known triple threat — actor, wrestler, flexer — it turns out Johnson is a mobile application entrepreneur and has announced The Rock Clock, an alarm clock app that has 25 hand-crafted ringtones from the creator imploring you to wake up. It is free, because we do not deserve Dwayne Johnson. It is on my phone, because I am the worst at waking up. [The Verge]

83 percent
The Indiana primary is today, and it’s in many ways the beginning of the end — one way or the other — of the #NeverTrump campaign. A clean win for Cruz in the state is a win for the anti-Trump forces within the GOP, and a win for Donald J. Trump is a massive setback and potential death knell for the forces opposing the real estate magnate. According to our polls-plus forecast based on nine polls, Trump has an 83 percent chance of winning the statewide vote. [FiveThirtyEight]

97.6 percent
Federal criminal cases rarely go to court these days — last year 97.6 percent of defendants in federal criminal cases simply pleaded guilty, and there were 40 percent fewer trials than in 2009. That may explain the fight-em-in-the-papers prosecutorial style of Preet Bharara — the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who has gone to war with Wall Street and New York state officials — as he has fewer opportunities to make noise in the courtroom. [The New Yorker]

170 pounds
Since his retirement, American Pharoah has gained 170 pounds and gotten hella laid. He is a horse and a Triple Crown winner, so it is not that weird. American Pharaoh’s racing success — which is a sport that has the interesting economic side effect of making normally worthless horse spermatozoa a wildly expensive commodity among rich people with weird hobbies — means that his owners get $200,000 every time a mare he mates with produces a foal that can stand. Capitalism is weird. [CNBC]
Correction: An earlier version of the last item in this article misspelled the name of the horse that won the Triple Crown. It is American Pharoah, not American Pharaoh.

4.4 percent increase
Jump in U.S. and Canadian sales at Burger King in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company credits that increase in part due to the addition of hot dogs to its menu. (BK makes a pretty crummy hot dog if you ask me, and this is coming from a person who is evaluating hot dogs in terms of relative quality.) [Miami Herald]

No. 253
Cornerback Kalan Reed was selected as the 253rd and final pick of the 2016 NFL draft, earning the future Tennessee Titan the dubious title of “Mr. Irrelevant.” Still, he’s among good company: Ryan Succop of the Titans was also Mr. Irrelevant, but has gone on to have a solid kicking career since he was drafted in 2009. [Yahoo Sports]

2017
Malia Obama has decided on what she’s doing for college: She will take a gap year, then enter Harvard University as a freshman in the Fall of 2017. [Reuters]

$17,570
The University of New Hampshire is trotting out the “mistakes were made” response to outrage over a $17,570 dining hall table. The custom table — outfitted with LED lights that would help staff demonstrate healthy cooking techniques — seats only 16, making it technically more expensive than a $1,000 per plate fundraiser. I don’t think I own a single thing worth more than $17,570. The Associated Press says $17,570 is “nearly as much” as tuition for in-state students at UNH. [WPDE]

$4.26 million
Amount spent by Facebook last year on security for CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuck is the world’s eighth richest person, and the company spent $12.5 million from 2013 through 2015 keeping him secure. [Bloomberg]

$26 million
Sen. Chuck Schumer, the heir apparent on the Democratic side of the Senate to succeed leader Harry Reid, is a fundraising juggernaut. Despite having an easy race this coming election, Schumer’s raised more than $26 million, money that can be transferred to party committees later in the cycle should the need arise.

No. 1 pick
With the number one pick in the NFL draft … the Los Angeles Rams selected Cal quarterback Jared Goff. But enough about that, let’s get to the real story of the night: A photo was shared on Laremy Tunsil’s Twitter account that appeared to show Tunsil smoking out of a gas-mask bong. This likely led to Tunsil, a highly touted offensive lineman, dropping to the 13th pick. [Sports Illustrated]

1 minute, 13 seconds
If you’re on the West Coast and missed NPR’s “Morning Edition” for a bit Thursday morning, the culprit has been found: A child visiting NPR headquarters as part of one of those bring-your-child-to-work days accidentally pressed enough buttons in a control room to take NPR off the air for 1 minute, 13 seconds in some areas. [Gawker]

6/17/2006
From June 17, 2006, to June 17, 2007, HBO had its best run of television in the network’s history, based on IMDb user ratings of aired episodes. As it stands, HBO is doing rather well at the moment, but with the eventual end of “Game of Thrones” on the horizon, the cable network is in desperate need of another big hit. [FiveThirtyEight]

93.2 out of 100 on the America scale
Suck it, John Mellencamp: If you wanted to pinpoint “normal America” on a map, it turns out the metropolitan area most similar to the United States is not somewhere in flyover country and not somewhere that has farms or horses or a Tastee Freez or stuff like that. It is, in fact, New Haven, Connecticut. That’s right, an analysis of the areas most resembling the U.S. as a whole found that the metropolitan areas most resembling the country were those around New Haven, Tampa and Hartford. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.6 billion
Companies that specialize in subscription-based commerce — namely getting your credit card number and charging you monthly for a good or service you may or may not use — have garnered about $1.6 billion in venture capitalist money since 2011. Many of these services, though, can be really bad for consumers, signing them on to a subscription without their knowledge. [Bloomberg]

$3.8 billion
Comcast plans to buy DreamWorks Animation SKG for $3.8 billion. Comcast is hoping the purchase will help it diversify its holdings and take on Disney, whose portfolio includes Pixar, Marvel and, yes, FiveThirtyEight. [Reuters]

7 years
Real-estate heir Robert Durst, who last year was the subject of HBO’s “The Jinx” documentary series, was sentenced Thursday to seven years in prison for a federal gun crime in Louisiana. He’ll likely serve his time in California, where he is charged with murdering his friend, Susan Berman. [Reuters]

40 people
Harvard is in the middle of a mumps outbreak, with 40 people sickened by the virus over the past two months. If the infection continues to spread, it could affect commencement. [CNN]

96 football players
Number of college underclassmen who opted to enter the NFL draft this year, passing up additional years of development in exchange for a potential NFL career with a big — well, since we don’t pay college athletes, let’s call it “any” — payday. That’s the second-highest number ever. [The New York Times]

120 people
A massive raid in the Bronx Wednesday led to the the arrests of 120 alleged gang members. The arrests targeted two rival gangs, Big Money Bosses and 2Fly YGz. It’s believed to be the largest gang-related arrest ever made in New York. [CBS New York]

30,000
The House of Representatives has passed the National Bison Legacy Act, which makes the bison our first national mammal. Not that we’ve always treated it well: the bison was once nearly extinct, leaving 30,000 wild bison left in the American West. There are another 400,000 in the country being raised as livestock. [The Guardian]

$46 billion
Apple’s quarterly report Tuesday detailed a decline in year-over-year revenue — the first time that’s happened in 13 years — which led to a large drop in the price of the company’s stock. The market for Apple’s existing product line is not growing like it once did, and its new products like the Apple Watch haven’t set the world aflame. The stock dropped as much as 8 percent Wednesday, which temporarily wiped out $46 billion from its market capitalization, before finishing the day 6.2 percent down. [CNBC]
