5 consecutive Emmys
Julia Louis-Dreyfus on Sunday evening won her fifth consecutive Emmy Award for best actress in a comedy for playing Selina Meyer on “Veep.” Over a long career excelling in a rare variety of roles, Louis-Dreyfus is already one of the most accomplished actresses in the history of television. [FiveThirtyEight]

15 percent
When you look back on the styles of the summer of 2016, do you think “cargo shorts?” Maybe you should; 15 percent of new shorts styles that went up for sale at online retailers were of the cargo-short variety, up from 11 percent in 2015. At this rate, by 2037 more than 100 percent of all new shorts will be cargo shorts, so now is the time to panic. [Bloomberg]

33 episodes
Netflix announced it will cancel “Bloodline” after its third season. One likely contributing factor is that Netflix spent a fortune on the show — Vulture estimates the three seasons will cost a quarter billion, give or take — and the company is interested in developing other properties that could gather awards. Sidebar: Congratulations to Ben Mendelsohn of “Bloodline,” who won the only acting Emmy award — Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series — for Netflix last night. Sorry that your show got cancelled, and I’m sure that “House of Cards” will finally deliver for Netflix next year. [Vulture]

49 percent
The bottom 49 percent of smartphone users download zero apps on average per month. The top 13 percent of users account for half of all app downloads in a month. If that information sounded boring, try rereading the sentences in the voice of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — that usually does it for me. [Recode]

LI
Lady Gaga has signed on to anchor the halftime entertainment of this season’s Super Bowl LI. “LI,” of course, is Latin for “51” and New Yorker for “I’m swiping left, he lives in freaking Nassau county.” [Us Weekly]

700 friends
An 18-year-old in Austria is pursuing justice where no one before her dared: Her parents posted a bunch of photos of her as a young child to Facebook, sharing them with 700 friends, and she’s suing the shameless oversharers. She claims she has the legal right to control how her body is represented on the internet. [Fusion]

28.4 percent
Playboy, which no longer contains nudity, saw sales at newsstands jump 28.4 percent in the first six months since the change. At the same time, subscriptions dropped 23.2 percent, presumably among the crowd unaware of internet porn and also uninterested in fine journalism for men of established taste. [New York Post]

58 percent
A Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll found that 58 percent of respondents considered Donald Trump dishonest when discussing financial and business dealings, with 50 percent saying the same thing about Hillary Clinton. [The Center for Public Integrity]

$835,000
Mattel, Viacom and Jumpstar will pay a total of $835,000 after it was found that they had been pushing out cookies on their websites and tracking kids, which is not legal. Viacom was hit with $500,000 for trackers on its Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon websites, Mattel was fined $250,000 for tracking tech on websites for kids toys, and Jumpstar owed $85,000 for sending visitor data to Facebook. Hasbro wasn’t fined but had tracking tech on its Nerf site. [BBC]

8.5 million
The population of New York City has passed 8.5 million, according to the latest estimates, the highest it has ever been. [The New York Times]

7.2 billion
Total airline passengers in 2015 in major regions, according to a trade association. Traffic was up 6.4 percent, buoyed by growth in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions. [Bloomberg]

$1.2 trillion
A conservative estimate of the annual value of religious institutions, properties, establishments such as hospitals and schools, and faith-based businesses in the United States, according to a new study. These institutions employ hundreds of thousands of people. [The Guardian]

1.5 inches wide
Have you bought bacon in America recently? All right, so have you noticed how from the front the shingle-style packed bacon looks like it doesn’t have a ton of fat, but when you look at the little window in the back of the package you can scope out the real deal? Fun fact, that window is federally mandated by U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations from the early ’70s. The window is required to be at least 1.5 inches wide and to show 70 percent of the length of the bacon. Neat! [Bloomberg]

40 percent
A former San Diego resident saved a species by having sex with six tortoises hundreds of times. That’s right, Diego (a giant tortoise) was sent from the San Diego Zoo back to the Galapagos Islands about 50 years ago to kick-start a breeding program when there were only two males of his species left on one of the islands. In the intervening period, 2,000 tortoises — 40 percent of which were fathered by Diego — have been released into the wild on the island, and the species is not on the brink of extinction anymore. [Metro]

44.5 percent
Percentage of complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that cited retaliation in 2015, up from 22.6 percent in 1997. While factors including race, sex and age discrimination have remained generally flat as a percentage of claims over the same period, “retaliation” — as in firing or demoting someone because  they complained or filed for discrimination — is steadily growing. [NPR]

400 kiosks
New York City is replacing its vestigial phone booths with Wi-Fi kiosks. Still, after a number of incidents, web browsing will be disabled on 400 LinkNYC kiosks because — gasps — people were using them to watch pornography. This raises a series of questions: Have the people who envisioned this system been to New York City? Are they, as I am now imagining, all Helen Lovejoy from “The Simpsons”? Did they peek inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal one day and conclude, “Yes,” scratching their chins, “a free Wi-Fi portal here will encourage people to engage more with city events and local night life?” [The Guardian]

$1.6 billion
Ford announced that it will move production of all of its small cars to Mexico, where it’s building a $1.6 billion assembly plant. This means that, given the current national political conversation, we can now confirm for a fact that The Ford Motor Company is not even remotely able to read the room. [The Associated Press via Sahil Kapur]

$66 billion
Bayer will buy Monsanto for $66 billion. It was the third time the German company upped its offer and will be the largest corporate takeover of the year so far. [CNN Money]

5 meteorologists
It seems like this happens every year, but five Russian meteorologists are surrounded by polar bears and trapped at a remote weather station on a frozen island. Sources indicate that the scientists recently ran out of the flares they were using to scare away the beasts, which in meteorology is considered a real bummer. A weather bureau 1,200 miles away plans to send more flares soon. [NBC News]

5.2 percent
The U.S. Census Bureau announced Tuesday that median household incomes in 2015 saw the largest year-over-year growth since the start of the survey in 1968, a 5.2 percent jump to $56,516. [FiveThirtyEight]

23 percent
Increase in motorcycle deaths in Michigan from 2014 to 2015, according to a road safety study that linked the uptick to a 2012 law that repealed the requirement for motorcyclists to wear a helmet. The sponsor of that bill, state Rep. Peter Pettalia, was killed Monday in a motorcycle crash. He was wearing a helmet. [Michigan Radio]

27 percent
Colorado sold $122.7 million in medical and recreational marijuana in July, a 27 percent year-over-year jump from that month in 2015. The recreational market accounted for a little more than two-thirds of the sales. [The Denver Post]

70-2
The Tennessee House of Representatives has expelled a legislator over alleged sexual misconduct. The chamber voted 70-2 to kick out Jeremy Durham, who has been accused of inappropriate conduct with nearly two dozen women. [The Tennessean]

90 percent
Congress mandated that NASA find 90 percent of the nearby asteroids that measure at least 460 feet across — the kind that could wreak havoc if they ever hit Earth — by 2020. NASA has now found 20 percent to 25 percent of the 25,000 estimated to fit that bill, and the agency won’t hit the target without more funding. If you are a wealthy supervillain interested in funding the U.S. space program, well, have I got an arbitrage opportunity for you. [FiveThirtyEight]

CORRECTION (Sept. 14, 10:45 a.m.): According to a correction attached to a linked article, an earlier version of an item misstated the number of asteroids measuring at least 460 feet across that scientists believe are near Earth. There are thought to be about 25,000, not 125,000.

7 events
In light of the effects of the controversial North Carolina legislation that removes protections for transgender people from local ordinances and forces people to use the restroom of the gender they were designated at birth, the NCAA will move seven planned events from North Carolina in 2016-17. The state Republican Party, which pushed the bill through, did not take it well. [NCAA]

13 games
Week 1 of the NFL saw 13 of 16 games decided by fewer than 10 points, tying the single-week record. True to form, two paragons of victory (the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Football Team That Really Plays In Maryland) let us down, each getting destroyed Monday night and ensuring that we didn’t break the record. [FiveThirtyEight]

2,560 measurements
A comprehensive study that involved dropping a lot of food found that the five-second rule is not real and that bacteria instantaneously hop onto your food when they contact it. [Medical News Today]

Number of people shot in Chicago so far this year. In 2015, there were 2,980 total. [Chicago Tribune]

15.1 million viewers
Number of viewers in the U.K. who tuned in to watch last year’s finale of “The Great British Bake Off,” a delightful program that is the most-watched show in Britain. On Monday, the BBC, which broadcast the show, lost the rights to Channel 4. More people watched that finale than watched the Olympics on the BBC. I want to know two things, people: Does this mess with America getting to see more “The Great British Bake Off,” and also what the hell is fondant? Mary Berry never cleared that up. [Variety]

287,176,547
Nelly did not pay some taxes and owes the federal government $2,412,283. Not paying taxes is a poor financial plan in general. But! Fans of the rapper are doing literally the least they can do and are streaming “Hot in Herre” on repeat from streaming services. By Spin’s estimation, at the most lucrative option of $0.0084 per stream, fans will need to play the song at least 287,176,547 times to get him back in the government’s good graces. [Spin]

58 percent
According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll, that’s President Obama’s approval rating as of early September, his highest since 2009. [ABC News]

82 degrees
Heat index Sunday in New York City. Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton left an event at the Sept. 11 memorial early because she was feeling ill; she needed to be helped into a car. Her campaign initially said she had become “overheated.” Later that day, her doctor confirmed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. [ABC News]

130 decibels
A fire suppression system test at an ING Bank data center in Bucharest, Romania, severely damaged the hardware, throwing the bank’s services offline. In a data center, conventional fire suppression systems — you know, like spraying a bunch of water — are bad ideas given the whole “this will kill everything on the server” properties of water. So instead they have these neat systems that pump in inert gases to snuff out the flame. The issue in Bucharest was that the gases fired out so quickly during the test that they made a really loud noise — more than 130 decibels — which vibrated and shattered a whole lot of hard drives. The future is weird. [Motherboard]

$20,000
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump uses money raised by his foundation for some rather interesting “charitable” purposes. For instance, he spent $20,000 in foundation money on a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. [The Washington Post]

$650 million
Back in February, the Obama administration requested $1.9 billion in funding to fight Zika, but Congress didn’t deliver. After that, the president shifted $650 million from other sources to cover the costs as a stopgap measure. That money is about to run out. [The Associated Press]

$2.45 billion
A $2.45 billion Department of Transportation loan to Amtrak will allow the passenger rail service to buy new trains for the Acela Express route, improve stations and rail on the Northeast Corridor, and eventually get Acela trains running every half-hour between Washington and New York during the busiest times of day.

5 nuclear tests
The U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.3 earthquake early on Friday. The earthquake happened to be observed right near a nuclear weapons test site in North Korea. Indeed, hours later North Korea confirmed that it had conducted a fifth nuclear test. [The Wall Street Journal]

59 percent
With Serena Williams losing in the semifinals, German Angelique Kerber is now the favorite to win the U.S. Open, with a 59 percent chance of doing so according to FiveThirtyEight’s U.S. Open predictions (brought to you by Chase). [FiveThirtyEight]

226 complaints
A Bloomberg analysis found that, since 2008, the 150 largest tech companies in Silicon Valley have faced 226 age discrimination complaints filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. There were more complaints regarding age than even race or gender bias. [Bloomberg]

5,300 employees
Wells Fargo has fired 5,300 employees in the past several years for creating unauthorized banking and credit card accounts for unwitting customers — all to earn more fees and up sales figures. Employees filed 565,443 credit card applications in customers’ names without the customers knowing. [CNN]

$100,000
Signing bonus the New York Mets paid to Tim Tebow, who was a not-very-good NFL quarterback but wants to roll the dice playing baseball apparently. That’s the highest bonus a team can give to a post-draft signing without getting penalized. Tebow will play for the Mets’ instructional team. In far better news, football is back! [CBS Sports]

$21.6 million
Amount raised in August by Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton. Priorities has raised $161 million in the election cycle so far. [The New York Times]

19 percent
A new report from Oceana, an environmental group, found that an estimated 19 percent of fish products purchased in restaurants and retail locations were not the fish they claimed to be. Incredulous patrons were left doubting other things they had taken for granted, such as “who really lives in a pineapple under the sea?” [Quartz]

31.4 percent
Of the 4,370 speaking characters in the top 100 grossing films of 2015, only 31.4 percent were women. That’s crazy. This obscenely low figure has varied only slightly since 2007. [FiveThirtyEight]

70 years
A 70-year-old man robbed a Kansas City bank, then sat down in the lobby rather than flee with his money. He told police that he did it because he would rather live in a jail cell than with his wife, with whom he’d had an argument. The cartoonist behind “The Lockhorns” is presumably furious over being scooped on this one. [Kansas City Star]

80 percent
Of the nearly five million students in U.S. public schools that show signs of a mental health disorder, 80 percent will not receive counseling, medication or any kind of treatment for it. [NPR]

SB 277
A California law, SB 277 — which forbids parents from sending unimmunized children to school — went into effect in July. And with kids now going back to school, the first wave of parents affected by the law will have to decide whether to tutor kids at home, leave California or vaccinate their dang kids.

60 percent
Probability Serena Williams wins the U.S. Open, according FiveThirtyEight’s U.S. Open predictions, sponsored by Chase. Williams has an 80 percent chance of defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals today. Still, don’t count competitors like Angelique Kerber out: The German has a 74 percent chance of winning her semifinal match and a 22 percent of winning the final. On the men’s side, Novak Djokovic is the heavy favorite, with a 90 percent chance of advancing to the final over Gael Monfils and a 70 percent chance of winning it all. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 percent
More than 80 percent of India is reached by a new 4G mobile network called Jio — bankrolled by India’s richest man — which will be free to use until the end of the year. The price will jump to at least $2.25 per month next year, but the rock bottom price is a play to undercut competitors for the market. [CNN Money]

520,000 metric tons
Do you like pistachios? Then it’s time to PANIC! World pistachio production will drop 86,000 metric tons in 2016 compared to last year, to 520,000 metric tons, according to the USDA. This is largely due to droughts in California, cutting U.S. production by half. [USDA, Gizmodo]

$20 million
21st Century Fox, which owns Fox News, paid $20 million to settle Gretchen Carlson’s sexual harassment lawsuit against the network’s former chairman, Roger Ailes. Moments after the announcement of that settlement, Greta Van Susteren, another Fox News host, left the company. [The New York Times]

$153 million
ITT Technical Institute, a for-profit college, shut down more than 130 campuses and laid off the “overwhelming majority” of its employees. The Department of Education had ruled that ITT would need to produce $153 million in additional collateral — on top of the $78 million it had on hand — to cover losses if it failed (the government feared being left on the hook). ITT is facing a suite of lawsuits, from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Massachusetts attorney general, regarding allegations it misled students.

President Obama pledged $90 million to help Laos clear unexploded bombs the U.S. dropped on the country during the Vietnam War. [The Washington Post]

19 chemicals
The Food and Drug Administration is banning all antimicrobial soaps containing any of 19 specified chemicals. The FDA’s ruling comes on the heels of research suggesting that the soaps don’t pose a major benefit to users and could help develop bacteria with resistance to antibiotics. [Ars Technica]

19 percent
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, hails from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. And yet the Christian Democrats, Merkel’s party, saw a major defeat on her home turf, finishing third, with 19 percent of the vote, in state elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday. The results would seem to be a rebuke of Merkel’s refugee policy: Her center-right party was outflanked on the right by Alternative for Germany, an anti-migrant party that took second place and 21 percent of the vote. [The New York Times]

On average, teachers in the U.S. make 78.6 percent of what other workers with the same level of education make. [Bloomberg]

How much money should you spend on a gift when someone in your immediate family is getting married? Respondents to a SurveyMonkey poll spent, on average, $147. That drops to an average of $82 on a wedding gift for a close friend and $71 for a member of their extended family. [FiveThirtyEight]
