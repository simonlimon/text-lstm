9 percent
Every year, Americans throw away 13 million tons of textiles, which amounts to about 9 percent of non-recycled trash. [PBS]

14 years old
Davontae Sanford spent nine years behind bars after confessing to committing four murders when he was just 14 years old. His confession was false — someone else later admitted to the crimes — and a judge on Tuesday ordered Sanford’s release. [NBC News]

36.8 percent
GM and Ford are going at it through advertising in the large pickup truck sector. So far this year, Ford has a slight edge: 36.8 percent of large pickup sales in the U.S. were Fords, while 35.5 percent were made by GM. [Bloomberg]

120-90
The Cleveland Cavaliers rallied back from a two-game deficit in their NBA Finals series against the Golden State Warriors Wednesday at home, beating the Warriors 120-90. Golden State is still the favorite, with a 77 percent chance of winning the title. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

$75.3 billion
The PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast for digital advertising revenues next year, largely buoyed by video ads on mobile phones. That’s a lot of dough, but it’s newsworthy for another reason: PwC forecasts $70.4 billion in advertising revenues for television broadcasters, meaning that the web is expected to triumph over television after years in the backseat.

1 hour
A leopard named Zeya escaped from its enclosure at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City for an hour on Tuesday. While this could have gone many different ways, it’s crucial to remember that leopards are cats: The beast was found napping in the rafters. [The Salt Lake Tribune]

4 states
New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and the big one, California, all voted Tuesday (catch up on FiveThirtyEight’s coverage of the primaries). Hillary Clinton won four of those states, putting her firmly ahead in the delegate count and establishing her as the presumptive Democratic nominee. [ABC News]

$15 per hour
The D.C. city council approved a $15 hourly minimum wage, to be phased in by 2020. Mayor Muriel Bowser will sign the measure. [WTOP]

38 percent
According to the CDC, 17 percent of teenagers and 38 percent of U.S. adults are obese. [NBC News]

18,600 sailors
The Navy hit the 18,600 U.S. sailors serving in Japan with a drinking ban following a car crash involving a sailor who was suspected of driving drunk. [Reuters]

$8.4 million
“Warcraft” beat the record set by “Furious 7” at midnight screenings in China, earning $8.4 million. This strong opening overseas is excellent news for the movie, which is currently rocking an 18 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes but is expected to be a hit in the Chinese market.

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. 

27 percent approval
Gov. Chris Christie has brutal approval numbers in his home state of New Jersey, which votes today in the presidential primaries. A Monmouth University poll reported a mere 27 percent of New Jerseyans approve of the job Christie is doing as governor. Furthermore, 80 percent said Christie cares more about his own political future than being governor. [Business Insider]

90 percent
Approximate percentage of U.S. companies that give annual raises on a fixed date each year, compared to 5 percent who give raises on the anniversary of an employee’s hire. General Electric — a longtime trendsetter in management — is reconsidering annual compensation increases. [Bloomberg]

53,575 miles
The Golden State Warriors, who are currently leading in the NBA Finals series over the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the most grueling regular season travel schedule in the NBA: 53,575 scheduled miles over the 2015-16 season. That has something to do with California being further away from most of the league — similarly remote teams including Portland, Minnesota and San Antonio follow Golden State on the list. But, interestingly enough, the team with the fewest aggregate miles traveled was Cleveland, with 35,055. [Quartz]

78,000 voters
Current California Green Party registration, down from 111,000 in early 2015. A spokesman credited the roughly 30 percent drop to the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has targeted members of the rather-left-leaning-indeed party to support him as Democrats in California’s (somewhat) closed Democratic primary, which is today. [Mother Jones]

1.1 million
Number of people ages 5 and older who spoke Arabic at home in the U.S. in 2014, 29 percent more than in 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau, already gearing up for 2020, is facing challenges translating the universal census form into Arabic. [Pew Research Center]

$9.1 billion
A year into Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption drive, his administration is reporting the recovery of $9.1 billion diverted from the government to former public officials or into private accounts. That’s great, but some Nigerians aren’t thrilled that the administration is refusing to name the corrupt individuals responsible for diverting the money. [Quartz]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. 

42 commutations
On Friday, President Obama commuted the sentences of 42 people serving time for drug offenses. [Fox News]

53.2 percent
California votes in its crucial Democratic primary on Tuesday. Our polls-plus forecast currently has Hillary Clinton finishing with 53.2 percent of the vote. [FiveThirtyEight]

74 years old
Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer, died on Friday after being treated for respiratory complications. His greatness defied statistics. [NBC News]

77 percent
A referendum in Switzerland on a proposal to pay all adults a monthly income of 2,500 Swiss francs — an idea generally referred to as a guaranteed basic income — failed, with 77 percent opposed to the measure and 23 percent in favor. Switzerland was the first country to hold a vote on such a proposal. [BBC]

$420,000
Candace Payne, a woman from Grand Prairie, Texas, recently recorded a video of herself trying to talk while wearing a Chewbacca mask. This video has been highly regarded on the internet; millions have watched it, and that has translated into an estimated $420,000 windfall for Payne and her family. [Money]

$35.3 million
“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows” won the box office this weekend, taking in an estimated $35.3 million. This report, coupled with the early success of “The Angry Birds Movie,” appears to indicate that Hell is empty and all the devils are here. [Bloomberg]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. 

9.4 points
Average simple error — that is, the difference between how a poll said the top two candidates in a primary performed and how they actually did — in the 2016 presidential primaries so far. The polls were a little worse than their average — 8.1 points — over the past five presidential cycles. Typically, though, primaries are a lot more difficult to nail than general elections. [FiveThirtyEight]

33 cities
The Guardian called up 81 cities east of the Mississippi to ask about their water supply. As it turns out, 33 of them have lead testing procedures that don’t conform to the EPA’s guidance, including pre-flushing water from pipes before testing it, running the water slowly, and removing aerators from faucets, all of which can make the lead reading lower. [The Guardian]

45.5 percent
Percentage of U.S. adults who worked for an employer at least 30 hours per week in May, the best rate for a month of May since the metric was developed by Gallup in 2010. [Gallup]

3,617 patents
Number of U.S. patents awarded to IBM though June 2, making it the largest awardee of patents in the technology space so far. It’s followed by Samsung, with 3,032, and Google, with 1,530. IBM averages 23.6 per day. [Quartz]

150 million
Reported number of daily users of Snapchat, the ephemeral photo-sharing and messaging app. This means that the newcomer has eclipsed Twitter in daily users, which analysts peg as having less than 140 million daily users. [Bloomberg]

$38.5 billion
Size of the payday loan market in the United States. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking to step in to regulate that high-interest sector of the lending industry. The requirements will include forcing lenders to look into a borrower’s capacity to pay the loan back, which you’d figure was standard, but nope, it is definitely part of the issue here.

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. 

64.1 percent
FiveThirtyEight’s current projection for Hillary Clinton’s share of the vote in the New Jersey primary, which is less than a week away, on next Tuesday. In California, she’s projected right now to pull in 55.4 percent of the vote. [FiveThirtyEight]

69 percent
Probability of the Golden State Warriors defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers to win the NBA title in the forthcoming series. The first game of the championship series is tonight, and Golden State’s got a 72 percent chance of winning. [FiveThirtyEight]

841.9 per 100,000 population
U.S. death rate in 2015, up from 823.6 per 100,000 in 2014. It’s the first increase in the death rate since 2005. [CDC, The New York Times]

3,400 milligrams
Approximate average daily sodium intake for Americans. The FDA wants that to get to around 2,300 milligrams, and issued voluntary guidelines yesterday urging food producers — like restaurants and manufacturers — to gradually decrease the sodium content in their food over time. The gist is that because salt tastes great, none of the individual producers have an incentive to reduce it alone, lest their food taste worse than their competitors. So the FDA wants everybody to gradually drop the salt. [The Wall Street Journal]

$491 million
Amount spent on television advertising in the presidential campaign so far, according to SMG Delta. Still, it’s somewhat questionable how meaningful that’s been in the race: $81.9 million came from Jeb Bush’s campaign and its Super PAC allies, $67.3 million from Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign and allies, and $57.8M from the Bernie Sanders campaign. [NBC News]

$3.5 billion
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber, the company announced. [The Wall Street Journal]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Huge thanks to Blythe Terrell for subbing for me yesterday. 

1 year probation
Joshua James, who for a day was the appointed Florida Man after tossing an alligator through a Wendy’s drive-thru window as part of a prank, has been sentenced to one year probation. A quick programming note: This is the first of two stories involving men from Florida and adjacent alligators today. [WPTV]

7th largest series comeback
In the third quarter of Game 6 between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors’ probability of winning the best-of-seven series was about 4.2 percent. Two subsequent victories make it the seventh-largest comeback in a best-of-seven series since 1984. [FiveThirtyEight]

15 feet long
A 15-foot long gator was spotted at Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto, Florida. This new data forced me to reconsider my mental ranking of sports, so I suppose golf is now the fourth-most dangerous game after Jumanji, Full-Contact Clue and hunting human beings for sport. [ESPN]

$287,858.44
Selling ice cream out of trucks in New York City is apparently a violent and disturbing business, as laid out in a frankly absurd article describing the difficulties facing the Mister Softee company due to a new competitor. And while Dimitrios Tsirkos of New York Ice Cream was ordered by a court to pay Mister Softee $287,858.44 in legal fees, and more than $767,000 overall, the real battle for ice cream is on the streets. “Every truck has a bat inside,” is a serious line from an article about ice cream trucks. [The New York Times]

1.2 million people
According to Amnesty International, that’s how many Afghans have left their homes following strife between the government and the Taliban. Many of those who have fled are moving from the country to the major cities, which is putting financial strain on some localities. [The Washington Post]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. This is Blythe Terrell subbing for Walt Hickey, who is off somewhere nailing “Shout.”

3 years old
The age of a boy who entered a gorilla enclosure Sunday at the Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo killed a 17-year-old gorilla, called Harambe, that was near the child. A lot of people are upset about the decision to kill the gorilla, but everyone is being super understanding about the parenting decisions involved. [CNN]

6-0
My St. Louis Cardinals came out on top over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday. Just wanted to get that out there in advance of what’s sure to be an NL Central bloodbath this season. May be time to update this guy. [ABC]

30 minutes
That’s how long a Thai man spent trying to remove a python from his penis after it latched on while he was using a squat toilet in his home near Bangkok last week. It’s good to know this kind of thing happens in real life and not just in Samuel L. Jackson’s magnum opus and also EVERYONE’S NIGHTMARES. [The Associated Press]

36 points
Steph Curry had 36 points in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals Monday night. His Golden State Warriors took out Oklahoma City, 96-88, to earn a rematch with Cleveland in the NBA Finals. But I think what we’re all most excited about is seeing more of this kiddo. [ESPN]

59 percent
Bookings at Trump Hotels over the past three months are down 59 percent year over year, which is fine because I’m pretty sure you’d make that up in a hot second Airbnb-ing the Lincoln Bedroom. [Priceonomics]

62 percent
The percentage of adults who get news on social media, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last week. So you should probably tweet that snake penis thing above, because, dammit, the people need to know. [Pew]

5-kilometer radius
The search for the lost EgyptAir Flight 804 will be narrowed to a 5-kilometer radius after Airbus, the manufacturer of the downed plane, detected signals in the Mediterranean Sea from the plane’s emergency locator transmitter. [CNN]

11th team
America has an Indoor Football League, which is news to me. The league is making a Utah team expansion, its 11th team, and the ownership of the forthcoming franchise is heavily involving fans in decision making. First up: the name. Which team from Utah will join the likes of the Iowa Barnstormers, the Tri-Cities Fever and the Billings Wolves? The top two contenders in a fan vote are the “Stormin’ Mormons” and “Teamy McTeamface.” Shockingly, the ownership is cool with this. [St. Louis Tribune]

61.2 percent
We are rapidly coming up on the conclusion of the Democratic presidential primary, and California and New Jersey are set to vote on June 7. Right now FiveThirtyEight’s forecast has Clinton getting 61.2 percent of the vote in California. [FiveThirtyEight]

72
That’s the number of metal bands per million people in the United States, according to an analysis of Encyclopaedia Metallum, a database of metal bands. Finland has 630 bands per million, Sweden has 428, and Norway has 299, just blowing us out of the water. #MakeAmericaMetalAgain. [Jakub Marian]

1,239 delegates
By the Associated Press’ reckoning — after talking to several unbound delegates who indicated they will now support Trump at the convention — Donald Trump has formally won the GOP nomination, eclipsing the 1,237 delegate majority needed to win. [The Associated Press]

70,000 missed flights
An executive from American Airlines said that TSA security screening delays led to 70,000 customers missing their American Airlines flights so far this year. [Reuters]

It’s Memorial Day Weekend, so Significant Digits is taking Monday off.

9 bedrooms
The Obama family will rent a nine-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot home in Washington, D.C., after the president leaves the White House and at least until Sasha completes high school. The house is in a tony neighborhood two miles from his current home. [The New York Times]

11 states
Officials from Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin are suing the Obama administration over its directive that requires schools to allow transgender students in public schools to use the restroom of their choosing. [Reuters]

30 percent
Percentage of Lego kits that include weapons according to research from New Zealand’s University of Canterbury. In fairness, a Lego brick on a hardwood floor against a barefoot opponent is the deadliest weapon known to man, and all of the sets are capable of that. [BBC]

94 startup founders
Bloomberg analyzed 890 U.S. startups that raised at least $20 million in venture capital and were founded in 2009-2015, and there are so, so many significant digits packed inside. One to get you started: While founders’ most common undergrad alma mater was Stanford (90 of them), slightly more, 94, dropped out or didn’t attend college at all. [Bloomberg]

218 NBA players
There are 447 players in the NBA, and 218 of them are related to an elite athlete (anyone who played any sport in college, professional leagues, or on a national team). Compared to random samplings of the NFL and MLB, that rate (48.8 percent) is huge. [The Wall Street Journal]

75.3 million visits
The number of visits to the 58 U.S. national parks that reported visitor numbers last year, the highest level ever. Gas is cheap, the weather is nice, and people are responding to promotional campaigns the National Park Service is putting out. In related news, I recently paused to watch two pigeons fighting over a churro at Columbus Circle, because I too am trying to broaden my horizons when it comes to exposing myself to the natural world around us.
