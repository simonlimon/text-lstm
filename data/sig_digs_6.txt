176 school districts
There are still 176 U.S. school districts (of about 13,500 total) that are under federal oversight to ensure that they continue to uphold desegregation. One of them is in Jefferson County, Alabama, and, wouldn’t you know, it appears a bunch of white families are trying to break off from the Jefferson County district to form a new district. [The Nation]

52,172 feet
Altitude attained by an engineless, experimental glider Sunday, a new record. The Perlan Project — sponsored by flight heavyweights like Airbus, Weather Extreme Ltd., United Technologies and BRS Aerospace — seeks to get an unpowered glider to heights of 90,000 feet. [USA Today]

$100,000
Amount spent by a pro-Kremlin “troll farm” on divisive Facebook advertising in advance of the 2016 presidential election, according to a blog post by Facebook spurred by the inquiry into Russian tampering in the election. [The Washington Post]

144,352 tons of tomatoes per square mile
The Netherlands has been investing in new and improved ways to maximize the efficiency of humane farming. Acre for acre, the Dutch are the best on earth: using greenhouses they get 144,352 tons of tomatoes out of every square mile, with the closest runner up — Spain — getting a fraction of that. Essentially, the Dutch decided to be a food R&D lab for everyone else — the secret seems to be greenhouses — and the outcome is they export more food, judging by dollar value, than every country except the U.S. [National Geographic]

200,000 students
New York City Schools will offer lunch to an additional 200,000 students, making free breakfast and lunch available to all students in the 2017-18 school year. [ABC 7 New York]

10 million
Square feet of office space managed by the startup WeWork, which offers co-working spaces and — increasingly — the service of running offices they themselves do not own. The company is valued at close to $20 billion on paper, which (again, on paper) is higher than Boston Properties, the largest publicly-traded commercial real estate company out there. [Wired]

The New York Jets have 1,000-1 odds to win the Super Bowl, according to Las Vegas’s Westgate SuperBook. [ESPN]

185 miles per hour
Sustained wind speeds of Hurricane Irma as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. Only one other Atlantic hurricane has ever been measured to have faster winds. No matter where Irma lands, it’s going to be dangerous. [Ars Technica]

200,000
Approximate number of Californians who were protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, roughly a quarter of the nationwide total. This is the same DACA policy that President Trump announced he intends to end, and the same California where Democrats plan to specifically target nine of the state’s 14 GOP congressional representatives in the 2018 midterms. Needless to say, DACA is going to come up. [Los Angeles Times]

1.397 million
Number of nonfarm jobs in Kansas in April 2008. Today, that figure is 1.400 million nonfarm jobs. But while that number has been flat in Kansas in recent years, the rest of the country has enjoyed solid net employment growth. So, relative to the rest of the country, Kansas’s job market has taken a meaningful downward turn. [Bradford Delong]

$58.7 million
Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk will pay $58.7 million to end a Justice Department probe into whether the company did not comply with FDA requirements to give doctors information about the cancer risks of Victoza, Novo Nordisk’s top selling diabetes drug. [Bloomberg]

6 months
President Trump is considering ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects 800,000 people who were children when they came to the United States as undocumented immigrants. One plan under consideration gives Congress six months to replace DACA before ending legal protections for the group. [The New York Times]

28 deals
The New York Daily News has been purchased by Tronc Inc., the company with the third-dumbest name in the industry. Tronc owns the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun. Last year 50 newspapers changed ownership across 28 deals. [Bloomberg]

50 percent
Hurricane Irma, a category 4 storm in the Atlantic, has already led to warnings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Island and an emergency declaration in Florida. Meteorologists say it has a higher than 50 percent chance of impacting Florida. [Buzzfeed]

3,000
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party was allegedly hit with 3,000 cyberattacks Sunday, some of which could be traced back to Russian IP addresses. Gosh, it would seem now would be a great time for any Western democracy who has endured Russian meddling in its election to stand up and give a clear reckoning of what happened. [The New York Daily News]

59 million
Number of people in the U.S. and Canada who play fantasy sports, according to a trade group. I am one of them, and given that I have two different drafts tonight, you can expect tomorrow’s Significant Digits to include overzealous cheerleading of Kareem Hunt’s limited statline in an attempt to overcompensate for my taking him early in the second round like the chump I truly am!

3.2 percent
This summer was bad for movies; the third-quarter domestic box office haul is projected to fall 21 percent short of last year’s summer season. A strong first quarter, and an expectedly strong fourth quarter, will likely keep the movie business from hitting a disastrous shortfall, but 2017 box office receipts are projected to come in down 3.2 percent compared to 2016. [The Hollywood Reporter]

5 starters
Number of starters returning to Michigan’s college football team this year, the fewest of any lineup in the country. The team ranks 127th out of 130 teams in experience, thanks to that attrition. Still, they enter the season ranked 11th overall, so let’s see what they can pull off. (College football is back this weekend!) [FiveThirtyEight]

3.5 million unauthorized accounts
It turns out that the number of unauthorized customer and small business bank accounts illicitly opened by Wells Fargo is 70 percent higher than originally indicated. An independent investigation of the 165 million retail accounts opened from January 2009 through September 2016, found 3.5 million that were potentially unauthorized, up from the original figure of 2.1 million. [CNBC]

$876 million
Republicans in the House had been looking to cut $876 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account. They seem likely to reconsider given Hurricane Harvey and the abysmal optics associated with gutting disaster aid right after a major natural disaster. But the $876 million cut had been planned to fund a portion of President Trump’s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. [AP News]

$1.2 billion
Jared Kushner’s family’s real estate company spent $1.8 billion to buy 666 Fifth Avenue in New York at the height of the housing bubble. Now, Kushner Cos. is scrambling to find a way to secure its financial future. The company holds half of the $1.2 billion mortgage on the building. It hasn’t paid any of that, and the full amount is due in February 2019. [Bloomberg]

61.5 billion kroner
Dong Energy — which stands for Danish Oil and Natural Gas — is getting out of the oil and natural gas business and moving completely to renewables. They’re now in the process of selling off their last oil and gas fields. And since 2011, the company has spent 61.5 billion kroner (exchange rates always move but that’s on the order of $10 billion) on wind farms and 4 billion on converting its power plants to use biomass.

1 triceratops
Bad news for the people in Thornton, Colorado, waiting for a new public safety facility on 132nd Avenue and Quebec Street: Work will be delayed because of a triceratops that is in the way. Workers uncovered the rare fossil while breaking ground, and now all sorts of scientists and museum curators are involved. [KDVR]

27 years
Alf Clausen, the composer on “The Simpsons” for the past 27 years, has been fired from the program. The longtime animated sitcom has been on a cost-cutting stint recently, but Clausen and his orchestra’s contributions to the show have been massive: They’ve been nominated for nearly two-dozen Emmy’s and have won two. [Vulture]

82 percent
A study of work-related activity found that employees use macOS (Apple’s operating system) while doing work on desktops 25 percent of the time. But Apple really dominates mobile work, 82 percent vs. Android’s 18 percent. [Computerworld]

465,000 people
Number of people in the U.S. with pacemakers that are vulnerable to being hacked, and thus need a firmware update. That’s obviously worrisome news, and I hope those people visit a doctor soon to get everything fixed. But the situation is also a great pitch for the kind of C-to-C-minus “Black Mirror” episode we’re going to start seeing when the show takes a dip after Season 7. [Ars Technica]

$1 million in looted Army weapons
According to testimony in federal court this week, over $1 million worth of stolen military equipment made its way to buyers in Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico and other countries after getting sold on the black market, including through some site on “dark web” called “eBay.” The equipment was allegedly stolen from Fort Campbell in Kentucky.

21.8 million comments
A study of the 21.8 million comments submitted to the Federal Communications Commission about repealing net neutrality rules found that 60 percent were against the FCC chair’s plan to overturn the status quo to benefit internet service providers, and 39 percent were in favor. But the difference is way more stark if you don’t count spam and form letters: 1.52 million comments against repealing the current regulations and a mere 23,000 in favor. [Ars Technica]

Rainfall accumulation (as of Tuesday) at Cedar Bayou near Mont Belvieu, Texas, due to Hurricane Harvey — the new, preliminary tropical cyclone rainfall record for the contiguous United States. [National Weather Service]

76 percent
Percentage of the roughly 215,000 students in the Houston public school system — the seventh largest system in the nation — who come from economically disadvantaged homes. The start of Houston’s public school year has already been delayed, and Harvey’s legacy will be a major, long-lasting issue for the district. [U.S. News & World Report]

1-1000
The Golden State Warriors are really, really good — like, have flirted with perfection good. As such, the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has them at 1-1,000 odds to make the NBA playoffs, meaning you would have to bet $100,000 to win $100 from the bookie. [ESPN]

135,335 test subjects
A study published in The Lancet backs up my pre-existing ideas about the dangers of a high carbohydrate diet. So, I’m including the study in my newsletter despite the deep skepticism you should apply to all new nutrition studies. Indeed, the study was conducted with food frequency questionnaires, which have a lot of limitations. (Quick! How many cups of ribs did you eat last week?) But the study did feature 135,335 people, which is a lot, and they found that eating a ton of carbs was associated with an increased risk of mortality. [The Lancet, via The Week]

847 million subscribers
A Goldman Sachs projection shows the future of the streaming music business looking rosy, projecting 847 million paid streaming subscribers worldwide by 2030. That would be up by more than 700 million from 2016. Global streaming revenues were at $4.56 billion in 2016, and Goldman sees them hitting $28 billion by 2030. [Music Business Worldwide]

0.08 percent
Amazon began overhauling Whole Foods on Monday — its first day as owner — by slashing prices. Amazon’s entry into the $800 billion supermarket biz has been fascinating, especially looking at its effects: Wal-Mart has added more fresh fruit; Costco more organics. Investors are reacting too. Kroger stock is down 37 percent this year (although, it was essentially flat yesterday), and Sprouts Farmers Market’s stock dropped 10 percent on Monday alone. Amazon shares rose 0.08 percent. [Bloomberg]

“100 percent” cheese
A U.S. judge dismissed a whole pile of litigation against Kraft Heinz, Target, Wal-Mart and Supervalu on Monday. Customers had sued for misleading Parmesan cheese labeling, claiming that “100 percent grated Parmesan cheese” obscured the fact that the cheese also contained a bunch of percents of wood pulp. In throwing out the lawsuits, the judge pointed to the ingredients clearly listed on the back of each container, and — because the law is where pedantry goes to thrive — said that the 100 percent claim “could also be taken to mean 100 percent of the cheese was Parmesan or that the Parmesan cheese was 100 percent grated.” [Reuters]

Share of homes in Harris County (which includes Houston) that have flood insurance, according to National Flood Insurance Program figures. This means that many homeowners could be on the hook for repairing and rebuilding homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey. [KTLA]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. Today, we’re focusing on the effects of Hurricane Harvey (now a tropical storm).

3 miles per hour
Tropical Storm Harvey is very slowly creeping back toward the Gulf of Mexico. But it was moving at only three miles per hour as of early Monday, so Southeast Texas, where Harvey made landfall, is still in danger. At least five deaths, and many more injuries, have been attributed to the storm. [Dallas Morning News, The New York Times]

50 inches of rain
With Harvey expected to remain around Southeast Texas for the next several days, cumulative rainfall in isolated parts of Texas could reach 50 inches. This would be the highest ever recorded in the state. The National Weather Service is describing the storm’s effects as unprecedented. [The Washington Post, NWS]

15 to 25 inches of rain
Additional rain forecasted to fall in the Houston area through Friday. [KHOU]

18 counties
As of Sunday, 18 counties in Texas were covered by the federal disaster declaration. Nearly 7 million of the state’s 27.8 million residents live in those counties. Fifty counties have been declared state disaster zones. [The Associated Press]

56,000 calls to 911
The city of Houston had received some 56,000 calls to 911 as of mid-day Sunday. Houston did not issue an evacuation order — it was decided that moving the 6.5 million people who live in the metro area by roads one day ahead of a major hurricane was unrealistic, and risked greater loss of life than the alternative.

About 9 trillion gallons
Harvey isn’t finished, but that was the estimated rainfall in Southeast Texas and the greater Houston area as of 12 p.m. Sunday. If it were all collected, you’d have a cube of water two miles wide and two miles tall. [The Washington Post]

Number of U.S. counties with zero insurers offering coverage in 2018 on the insurance marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act. CareSource decided to cover the sole remaining county in Ohio without an insurance plan available through the marketplace. [Kaiser Family Foundation, The Wall Street Journal]

5 turbines
New Orleans, to some notoriety, is low-lying, which leaves it particularly susceptible to flooding. To prevent that, the city relies on five turbines that power 120 pumps. As Hurricane Harvey threatens New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico, however, 15 of those pumps are offline. Also, three of those five turbines are not working. The city has mobilized 26 backup generators. [NBC News]

50 jobs
The state of Iowa will give Apple $208 million in tax breaks in exchange for promising to create at least 50 jobs as part of a $1.4 billion datacenter project near Des Moines. Iowa, I will gladly hire a personal assistant in the Des Moines area if you give me $4 million dollars in tax incentives. [Yahoo]

118 decibels
London’s Big Ben this week went silent for four years as part of a $37 million restoration. The 118 decibel chimes could seriously damage the hearing of people working on the clock. [The New York Times]

9,500 respondents
Number of participants in a survey intended to determine how Canada talks. It turns out Canada has a staggering array of regional distinctions in language, and we’re not just talking about the whole “occasional French” thing. (The survey only covered English speakers.) For instance, the East calls them sneakers, the West calls them runners, but Ontario and Quebec call them running shoes. As a U.S. resident, I was surprised to learn that only Nova Scotia and Quebec call them “coloured pencils”; apparently the drawing implements are referred to as “pencil crayons” in most of the rest of the country.

Size of the U.S. youth sports market, which has grown 55 percent since 2010. Cheap little leagues are out, pricey private coaching and travel leagues are in. [TIME]

9.4 percent
Decline in sales of new homes in July compared to June. The drop, an 8.9 percent fall compared to a year ago, was a surprise — economists were anticipating a small gain. New housing inventory is at its highest level since 2009, with 276,000 units on the market. [CNBC]

15
Weeks that “Despacito” has spent at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Just one further week and the song will tie a record set by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men in the mid-1990s. Carey’s fans are really pulling for Cardi B or Taylor Swift to unseat the song of the summer before the record has a chance to change hands. [Into, Billboard]

20 inches
Texas and Louisiana appear to be in the path of Hurricane Harvey, and the National Hurricane Center anticipates heavy rains in the region with a chance of bad flooding. The current forecast has a possibility of over 20 inches of rain before next Wednesday, which would be more than enough to cause severe flooding in some areas. [Grist]

75 percent
Percentage of the sand on California beaches that originated from the state’s rivers and streams — that is, before those rivers were aggressively dammed up. One side effect of the state’s dam use is that 2.7 billion cubic yards of sand has been trapped that otherwise would have made its way to the sea. [EE News]
