17 years
Music streaming service Pandora remains in trouble — but still inexplicably alive — after 17 years of never reporting a profit. [The Outline]

21 percent
Percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who use streaming services who told a Reuters/Ipsos poll that they had accessed a digital streaming service using some other person’s credentials. That’s crazy, because that’s exactly equal to the 21 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds who need to shut the hell up before they ruin a perfectly good thing by mouthing off to a bunch of pollsters. Seriously, do you people have any chill? [Reuters]

58 construction cranes
Seattle tops the list of cities with the most construction cranes on their skylines, with 58. In second place, trailing by 22 cranes, is Los Angeles. [The Seattle Times]

6 percent
Monmouth University released the results of a poll Monday that sought to figure out what New Jerseyans thought of Gov. Chris Christie’s ill-advised beach adventure. Eighty-six percent of respondents had seen the photos. The pollster also reported that “another 6 percent of those polled simply used some form of profanity to express their sentiments about Christie’s beach day.” [Politico]

7 percent
Amazon is building a competitor to Geek Squad, a service offered by Best Buy to install, set up and repair tech. The news of this fact Monday morning led to a 7 percent drop in Best Buy’s stock, wiping out $1 billion in market cap within hours. [Recode]

125 theaters
Christopher Nolan’s latest film, “Dunkirk,” was shot entirely on 70-millimeter large-format film, all 106 minutes of it. It’s getting released in 70 mm at 125 theaters. If this play is a financial success, it could be huge for an industry that is presumably running out of two-dimensional media to throw money at. [The Atlantic]

300,000 umbrellas
A startup in China that sought to apply the bike-sharing business model to umbrellas has lost almost 300,000 umbrellas over the course of a few weeks. [Shanghaiist]

$50 million
How much money the companies behind Viagra and Cialis spent on advertising during NFL games last season. The pair won’t buy advertising this season, so God only knows what the poor ad copywriter who comes up with network-TV-friendly ways of talking about erections will do to feed his presumably numerous kids.

1 percent to 1.5 percent of overall cost
Typical cost of cancellation insurance for a music festival. Insuring this type of event — where a bunch of young people get hammered in public — is intrinsically difficult but absolutely necessary. The Fyre Festival may have made it impossible for similar future events to even get off the ground with its catastrophic failure to launch. [Bloomberg]

2.5 percent
Wages are essentially flat in the United States, growing only 2.5 percent from June 2016 to June 2017. Factor in inflation, and that level is close to 1 percent growth. [The Guardian]

3 campaign members
The New York Times has reported that three close associates of President Trump’s who were working on his campaign — campaign chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. — met with a Russian lawyer with Kremlin ties who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton in June 2016. [The New York Times]

10 years
There’s been considerable research into the negative economic effects of a Walmart entering a town, but now we’re getting a look at the deleterious effects of its departure. A supercenter that was open for a decade in McDowell County, West Virginia, closed last year, and its absence has led to a loss of local tax base, a loss of jobs and a lack of access to fresh food for residents of the U.S. county that ranks last in the country in life expectancy. [The Guardian]

15 percent
The nominal price of a U.S. home has returned to pre-crash levels, on average, while inflation-adjusted home prices remain below the heady peaks of 2007. Still, everyone hasn’t enjoyed the rebound equally. Prices in 15 percent of markets — including Pittsburgh and San Francisco — have risen above the peak levels of the mid-2000s, while prices in markets including Cleveland and those in much of Florida have not. [NPR]

$117 million
Sony’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming” appears to be a hit, pulling in $117 million domestically over its opening weekend and beating out enormous expectations. [Variety]

In a last-ditch bid to turn the company around, Soundcloud, the digital music streaming site, is laying off about 40 percent of its staff. [Bloomberg]

80 percent
For the past five years, China has accounted for over 80 percent of North Korean imports and exports, which has helped the isolated nation’s economy remain viable. In 2001, China was responsible for only 18 percent of North Korean exports and 20 percent of imports. [The Wall Street Journal]

80 to 85 percent
Cirque de Soleil is buying the Blue Man Group for an undisclosed sum. Right now Cirque de Soleil relies heavily on live shows, which generate 80 to 85 percent of its business. The company wants to diversify and increase revenues from merchandising, and the Blue Man Group — with its six shows in residence and two tours — opens up new, more international audiences. [Bloomberg]

2022
In addition to its plans to end sales of diesel and gasoline-fueled automobiles by 2040, France’s environment minister outlined a plan that would have the nation phase out its use of coal for electricity by 2022. [The New York Times]

400,000 streams
Nearly the number of times “Happy Birthday, Matthew” has been streamed on Spotify, just one of many clever schemes to turn the incremental payments of single streams into a steady flow of income. Everybody has a birthday, there a lot of people are named Matthew, and some of those Matthews want to stream a personalized version of “Happy Birthday” on the big day. The business then scales because — and this is huge — there are several additional names besides “Matthew.” [Vulture]

$2.1 billion
QVC and HSN are merging in a $2.1 billion all-stock transaction. QVC has almost three times as many employees and made $10.22 billion in revenue last year to HSN’s $3.57 billion. This is perfect for creating the retail juggernaut of tomorrow, because I cannot think of a single other way to shop using technology other than the television. [The Wall Street Journal]

CORRECTION (July 7, 1:53 p.m.): An earlier version of this post misstated which channel QVC is merging with. It is HSN, not HLN.

8 percent
Paris and Los Angeles are competing for the rights to host the 2024 Olympic games. The International Olympic Committee has finally wised up and realized they should probably pick a city where the population actually wants to host the Olympics. Polling by the IOC suggests that 78 percent of L.A. residents and 63 percent of Paris residents favor their cities hosting the games. The key number for the IOC: 23 percent of Paris residents oppose the games in Paris compared to 8 percent of Los Angeles residents. [Sports Business Daily]

20 percent
Under the GOP health care bill, average premiums for midlevel insurance plans are projected to rise by 20 percent next January. This presents a bit of a pickle for Republican legislators, who could be held responsible for a huge premium hike in 2018 midterm elections. [The Wall Street Journal]

In Russia, companies may be able to write off ransoms paid to malware hackers under Article 265 of the Russian Tax Code, provided they can get those shakedown artists to at least give them a receipt. [Bloomberg BNA]

5,500 artifacts
Prosecutors filed a stipulation of settlement Wednesday with Hobby Lobby. The company bought over 5,500 artifacts, namely clay tablets, that may have been looted from historical sites in Iraq. The company will have to return all of the artifacts and pay the government $3 million to resolve the civil action. [The New York Times]

371,403
Number of new motorcycles sold in 2016, down from 716,268 at the market’s peak in 2006. As baby boomers, who for a long time were the meat and potatoes of the motorcycle business, age out of the market, motorcycle brands are trying to get more starter bikes on the market to recruit new riders.

Gov. Chris Christie’s favorability rating in New Jersey. This past weekend the governor enjoyed an empty beach with friends. The beach was empty because state beaches were closed due to his administration’s failure to pass a budget. Christie’s 15 percent favorability rating is barely better than that of past governors who were actual crooks. [FiveThirtyEight]

1 pigeon
A noble pigeon did the avian version of streaking this week when it stormed the court during a Wimbledon qualifying match and delayed the game by about a minute. The pigeon was lucky Rufus the Hawk wasn’t on the job at that moment. Normally, Wimbledon employs Rufus to discourage lesser birds from bugging players. [Deadspin]

6 countries
Last night at 8 p.m. Eastern, President Trump’s travel ban went into effect, partially — banning visa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees unless they have “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” Some family relations count (including a parent, child, spouse or sibling), and some don’t (including a grandparent, cousin, niece or uncle). And importantly, the administration’s guidelines don’t consider a refugee’s ties to a resettlement agency — often the only connection refugees have in the U.S. — as a “bona fide relationship.” [The Guardian]

59 percent
Tailored Brands Inc. — which owns the now-merged Jos. A. Bank and Men’s Wearhouse — has seen its stock drop 59 percent from the beginning of the year through Tuesday’s close. The latest blow: American Airlines dropped its contract with Tailored Brands to supply the airline with uniforms. Do you have any idea how seriously you have to screw up for an airline to be dissatisfied with your customer service experience? [Bloomberg]

80 wins
Phil Jackson and the New York Knicks are parting ways. Jackson’s tenure as president of the Knicks was … tumultuous. He was really good at underpaying rookies and also very good at overpaying veterans. Under Jackson’s stewardship, New York went 80-166. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 hospitals
Almost 80 rural hospitals have permanently closed in the U.S. since 2010. Five closed in Alabama. Those closures are just one way in which the U.S. health care system is failing black Americans in the rural South. [FiveThirtyEight]

120 gigawatt-hours per year
Cheap batteries are about to flood the world and potentially revolutionize how we use power. The U.S., led by Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc, will push out more than 35 gigawatt-hours of batteries per year by 2021, according to a Bloomberg report. But it’s China where the real glut is happening; China has plans to build factories capable of putting out more than 120 gigawatt-hours annually, combined, by the same year. [Bloomberg]
