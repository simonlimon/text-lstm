Number of guns previously owned by Al Capone now in the possession of the IRS, which put the mobster away for tax evasion. The IRS recently sent the wrong gun owned by Capone — one obtained in in the 1930s, not the one confiscated in a raid in 2004 — to the Mob Museum in Vegas, thus reminding the agency of the abundance of Capone-related riches in its vaults. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.25 million
Investor Peter Thiel will give Donald Trump $1.25 million in support of his candidacy. I thought the whole point of Silicon Valley venture capital was to invest early? [Reuters]

$10 million
A map of the world from 1531 will go on sale for $10 million later this month. The goat-skin map is believed to be the earliest to detail New York Harbor. [Bloomberg]

$61.8 million
The value of the coins that Americans throw away every year. Some companies are trying to tap into that “market.” [Bloomberg]

$2.2 billion
Sales of personal wet wipes in 2015. The industry is booming — and wreaking havoc on sewer systems. The issue comes down to what precisely defines “flushable.” Just because you can flush it does not mean you should; the definition, for advertising purposes, was set by an industry group, not the people who actually run sewer systems. [The Atlantic]

$3.1 billion
Amount spent on Halloween costumes in the U.S. according to the National Retail Federation. All told, consumers will spend $8.4 billion on the holiday, which explains those Halloween popup stores appearing all over the country. [Tedium]

70 percent
Percentage of food manufacturers’ marketing budgets that goes to trade promotion fees, which is money paid to supermarkets to score better product placement and promotion. [Quartz]

70.9 percent
What are the most pass-heavy teams in the NFL? FiveThirtyEight contributor Chase Stewart calculated the Adjusted Pass Ratio — the percentage of plays where a quarterback attempts a pass, is sacked or scrambles, ignoring spikes and kneel-downs — for all the teams in the NFL. Jacksonville and Kansas City come out on top, with Adjusted Pass Ratios of 70.9. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas and Tennessee are among the run-heaviest teams this season. [FiveThirtyEight]

1993
Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday; he’s the first American to win the prize since Toni Morrison won in 1993. Don McLean must be furious. [The Guardian]

22,450
Estimated number of people employed at Donald Trump’s companies. Only a dozen have contributed more than $200 to his campaign. Maybe he’s just such a great boss that his employees can’t stand to see him leave them for the presidency. [Reuters]

120,000
Amazon says it will take on more than 120,000 seasonal workers for the holidays this year. Last year, 14,000 seasonal employees went on to get regular full-time positions, the company said. [@DanLinden]

246,000
Jobless claims in the period ending Oct. 8. The four-week average for unemployment benefit filings is the lowest since 1973. [Bloomberg]

2.7 inches
Australia moves 2.7 inches a year because of its position on a remarkably active tectonic plate. The country has issued a reset of its official coordinates four times in the past 50 years and will issue a fifth at the end of the year. [The New York Times]

3 radar sites
The U.S. military struck three radar sites in Yemen on Wednesday after the USS Mason and USS Ponce were targeted with cruise missiles. [U.S. Defense Department, USNI News]

4 goals
Auston Matthews, the first overall pick in the NHL draft, scored four goals in his rookie debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday. He’s the first player in the modern NHL to pull that off in his debut. Oddly enough, Toronto lost the game 5-4 to the Ottawa Senators. [ESPN]

68 percent
Saudi Arabia’s crude oil revenue has fallen to 334 billion riyals this year from more than 1 trillion riyals in 2011, a 68 percent drop. That’s like if the U.S. just forgot to collect most of its taxes. [Bloomberg]

165 pounds
Amount of raw mined material required to produce an average cell phone. This makes the decision by Samsung to pull the plug on its 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s an environmental catastrophe, given the poor state of the tech recycling system. [Motherboard]

$461 billion
A surprisingly huge chunk — at least 2.5 percent! — of global trade consists of pirated or ripped-off products. Estimates range from $461 billion to $1.8 trillion in counterfeit stuff. Which reminds me — accept no substitutes from the far inferior “Remarkable Figures” column and newsletter. [Bloomberg]

7
Rest in peace, Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The phones were shipped to much acclaim. Then they started exploding. This was considered a flaw — I mean, not on par with the lack of a headphone jack, but a flaw nonetheless — and so the phones were recalled. The replacement phones also exploded. So now, having learned the lesson of Swamp Castle, Samsung is just discontinuing the line. [The Telegraph]

+15 points
Based on an average of recent polls, Hillary Clinton is up 15 points among women and Donald Trump is up 5 points among men. Based on this data and the FiveThirtyEight model, if only women voted in the election, Hillary Clinton would win with 458 of 538 electoral votes. If only men voted — this used to be a thing in American history, you may recall — Trump would win with 350 electoral votes. [FiveThirtyEight]

17 propositions
California is a nightmare. The state’s ruthless devotion to the plebiscite means it’s throwing a fistful of policy questions at the electorate every cycle rather than, you know, exploiting the representative democracy feature of our republic. The best-case scenario is “maybe you pass some taxes that otherwise you couldn’t have,” and the worst case is — if you ask me — an international disgrace. Anyway, Californians get to deal with 17 ballot propositions this November, asking your everyday random person whether cigarettes get more expensive, the death penalty gets repealed, and — of assuredly worldwide interest — whether pornography performers will be forced to wear rubbers. Democracy! [The Los Angeles Times]

42 percent
Percentage of Republican women serving in Congress or as governors who don’t support Donald Trump, compared with 17 percent of GOP men in those offices. Golly, I wonder what happened here. [FiveThirtyEight]

52 percent
Percentage of millennials who said that the “pro-life” label describes them, according to a Public Religion Research Institute survey. The movement against abortion rights is adapting to changing norms and a younger, politically involved group of believers. [Slate]

$120 million
The United Nations humanitarian aid agency has asked for $120 million in aid for Haiti, which was hit by Hurricane Matthew. [The Guardian]

+16 points
House Speaker Paul Ryan is in the unenviable position of trying to keep his job while also distancing himself and his party from Donald Trump. This is hard for Ryan because Republicans like Donald Trump way more than they like him. A YouGov poll found that Trump had a +36 percentage point net favorability rating among GOP primary voters; Ryan’s was only +16 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

24 flops
Of 61 Trump business ventures from the past decade analyzed by The New York Times, 24 did not work out, 16 had problems and 21 were successful. [The New York Times]

30 percent
Based on analysis from the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 30 percent of the working-age population in the U.S. and Europe is employed as an independent worker in the “gig economy.” [BBC]

32 percent
Ford will shut down its Mustang factory in Michigan for a week. The line is selling poorly — down 32 percent last month — while Chevrolet’s Camaro is thriving thanks to incentives from the manufacturer. Workers will continued to be paid; there’s just not enough demand. [Bloomberg]

59 percent
The National Asian American Survey — which tackles the difficult task of polling the 4 percent of the electorate that is Asian-American — found that 59 percent of the group favors Clinton, 16 percent prefers Trump, and 26 percent is undecided or backs a third-party candidate. [FiveThirtyEight]

115
Number of explicit spells said in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” the most of any of the Potter books, according to an analysis by Skyler Johnson. [Tableau Public]

2 states
Vermont became the second state, after South Dakota, to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Columbus Day — the holiday so toxic that it is singlehandedly responsible for the worst episode of “The Sopranos” — is today, so if you’re off work, consider this one a freebie Significant Digits. [NBC 5]

18 percent
As of Sunday evening, that’s the percentage of elected GOP governors and members of Congress who were not supporting presidential nominee Donald Trump. The majority of them withdrew their support this weekend, following the publication of a video of Trump where he was caught making lewd comments about women and apparently condoning sexual assault. [@Taniel, The Washington Post]

$112,000
A 12-year-old Spanish boy mistakenly spent $112,000 on Google AdWords promoting his band. The search giant forgave the debt. [The Guardian]

410,703
Number of ballots already cast in jurisdictions that allow early voting, according to the United States Elections Project. If last night’s debate stressed you out — regardless of which side you’re on — you can sleep tight knowing it was utterly meaningless for more than 400,000 potentially decisive ballots. [ElectProject.org]

$131.6 million
Amount spent by Hillary Clinton’s campaign so far on television advertising, compared with $25.7 million by the Trump camp. The campaigns have spent less so far than the 2012 nominees had shelled out at this point, even if you account for super PAC spending. [Bloomberg]

$4 billion to $6 billion
Economic impact of Hurricane Matthew as derived from insured property damage, according to consulting firm CoreLogic. [USA Today]

1 in 5
One in five millennials has had a Big Mac in their lives. This is an issue for the hamburger manufacturer. The company may have made $8.6 billion in the U.S. in 2015, but the fact that I, a 26-year-old, can not name that random list of crap in a Big Mac could be an existential threat for the company long term. [The Wall Street Journal]

9
And now the Australian news of the week: The most consequential trial in the history of Australia ended Thursday. Following Daniel Ricciardo’s win in the Formula One Grand Prix in Malaysia, nine Australian supporters drank in the street wearing what we in the U.S. call Speedos but the Aussies call, no joke, “budgie smugglers.” This did not go over well. They were jailed for four days but released after the nine came off as remorseful. [The National Post]

13 marijuana plants
In a major international marijuana operation bust, 13 “nearly whole” female cannabis plants have been found in the home of a northern Chinese man. The man has been dead for anywhere from 2,800 to 2,400 years, and the aforementioned room is his tomb. Yeah, you just got Twilight Zoned. [NPR]

29 percent
According to a new PRRI/The Atlantic poll, that’s the percentage of Clinton supporters who live in the town where they grew up, compared with 40 percent of Trump supporters. [The Atlantic]

$5 billion
Amount spent on the subscription marketplace, by which we mean those monthly boxes that deliver a hodgepodge of goodies — makeup, nerd crap, food — to your doorstep. What a daft business model, requiring consistent delivery to a regular subscriber.

Expected value of the bottled water market by 2020, bringing a new meaning to the phrase “money for nothing.” [The Guardian]

50 percent
A poll of Chinese citizens found that 50 percent were willing to trade a better economy for cleaner air, saying that air pollution should be reduced at the expense of economic growth, compared to 24 percent who said pollution was simply the price for growth. [Pew Research Center]

300 percent
Off the news that sightings of clowns wandering the country were disturbing passersby, the head of Halloween Express’ online operations announced sales of clown masks were up more than 300 percent year over year. Many are concerned about the clowns roaming around the nation’s streets and forests and countryside, but I’ve heard of weirder fetishes you know? [My Fox 8]

340 employees
Theranos — the medical technology company slapped with regulatory sanctions after significant issues with their blood testing technology were uncovered by John Carreyou of the Wall Street Journal — will fire 340 of its 790 employees and shut down its blood testing facilities.

Daniel Schulli, a Canadian father, won a lottery jackpot worth over $9.7 million and is refusing to tell his children until they find out about it on the news.

$1.13 billion
Amount spent on EpiPens by U.S. government health plans from 2011 through 2015. Medicare spent $797 million after rebates and Medicare Part D spent $335 million. [Reuters]

52 percent
Percentage of Millennials who don’t plan to get a flu shot. One young person to another, this is an awful idea and you should get a damn flu shot. A quarter of those millennials were not getting inoculated due to financial concerns. I can assure you, as a person who did not understand how health insurance worked for several years, a flu shot is worth about four beers. [Bloomberg]

A five-mile stretch of the Great Wall of China was “restored” with ugly-looking concrete, which has been met with criticism from onlookers and now the internet. The World Heritage Site is in disrepair in portions — understandably so, it’s rather old indeed — and less than 10 percent is considered to be in good condition. [Smithsonian Magazine]

19 percent
Based on the latest from the FiveThirtyEight election model, that’s the percentage of the time that Florida provided the deciding electoral vote in simulations of the U.S. presidential election.
