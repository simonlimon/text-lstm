8 networks and studios
Nielsen’s Subscription Video On Demand Content Ratings — which claim to assign previously impossible-to-determine numbers to streaming video performance on services like Netflix — has had eight networks and production studios (A&E Networks, Lions Gate, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. among them) sign up. Netflix, which enjoys its current status as a black box, says Nielsen’s numbers aren’t accurate. [Bloomberg]

25 percent
Maybe houses are getting bigger, maybe lots are getting smaller, but houses built since 2015 occupy, on average, 25 percent of the land they were built on. That figure was only 13.9 percent in 1975. [Trulia]

32 percent
Percentage of kids who said they preferred watching videos on a non-television device in 2016, according to researcher EMarketer, potentially one component fuelling the rise of YouTube’s kid influencer channels. The channels show children evaluating toys, often receiving generous compensation from toymakers in exchange. The holidays are coming up — one of the busiest times of the year for toy sellers and now YouTube influencers. [Bloomberg]

2 countries
On Tuesday a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the Trump administration from implementing a ban on travelers from the countries of Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad and Somalia that was set to go into effect today. The granting of Hawaii’s request for a temporary restraining order nationwide does not effect the ban on North Korea and Venezuelan citizens’ travel. [The Washington Post]

2 firings
Two Chicago law enforcement officers were fired, one resigned, and a fourth received a five-day suspension (shortened on appeal to two days) for the incident at O’Hare International Airport in April in which 69-year-old Dr. David Dao was taken off an overbooked United Airlines flight. The report from Chicago’s Inspector General on the “violent forcible removal” indicates that the officers made misleading statements when describing the events. [NBC News]

3 hours, 35 minutes
Awful news: There’s more baseball than there was last year. The average time for a nine-inning playoff game is up 10 minutes from last year and up 21 minutes from two years ago. As a person who on the whole would enjoy less baseball — not no baseball, just a little bit less of it — this is very much a move in the wrong direction as far as I’m concerned. [ESPN]

Last night Manny Abell won on Jeopardy! with but a single dollar to his name. He beat out two other contestants who were tied and far ahead going into Final Jeopardy. Winning with only a dollar is an event that has happened only one other time in the history of the program, way back in 1993, a time that video evidence indicates was in the period when Alex Trebek still enjoyed his job.

1992
That’s the last year the New York Yankees — now a game back in postseason play against the Astros — had a sub-.500 record. The team anticipated this would be a rebuilding year; they’re now one of the four teams still in contention for the World Series title. What’s more, they appear to have many prospects developing now that will fuel the organization for years to come, regardless of how this year shakes out. [ESPN]

1.17 billion pounds
Amount of money earned by the fixed-odds betting terminals in shops around the United Kingdom. The terminals allow users to bet 100 pounds every 20 seconds. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is considering cutting the maximum allowed wager in an effort to lessen problem gambling in the country, but it would come at a major cost to the owners of those machines. On average, investors surveyed believed the maximum bet would drop to 14.50 pounds. [Bloomberg]

$8 billion
Netflix wants to make half its library original content by 2018, and in order to do so will spend $8 billion next year producing 30 new anime series and 80 original films. For those at home who have lost count, there are only 52 weeks in a given year, which means Netflix will be putting out content at an unheard of clip. [The Verge]

31 years old
Austria is poised to have the youngest leader in Europe following elections there Sunday. Conservative Sebastian Kurz, 31, is expected to attempt to form a coalition with a far-right populist party.

49 percent
That’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s approval rating in California as of a late March poll, 7 points down from the previous year. Feinstein votes with President Trump’s priorities more often than we would expect from a typical senator from California, where the president lost by 30 points, which is one potential reason Kevin de Leon, the president of the California state senate, appears poised to challenger her in a primary. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of characters created on D&D Beyond from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 who were fighters, by far the most common class, followed by rogue, wizard, barbarian and cleric.

26 percent down
The Tonight Show on NBC’s ratings have dropped substantially while rivals — Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” and Jimmy Kimmel’s “Live” — are increasingly winning late night. Fallon’s ratings are down 26 percent last week compared to the same period last year. It’s a shame that topical, incisive comedy is beating out the comedic stylings of Jimmy Fallon — from the iconic Lick it For Ten to the hard-hitting but fair Competitive Spit Takes. [Vulture]

62 percent
At the top 75 Silicon Valley companies women comprise only 23 percent of technical roles. While that sector can be rather fond of deflecting blame, Sephora — the global cosmetics conglomerate — is putting them to shame when it comes to developing and rewarding that kind of talent, as seen with 62 percent of the firm’s technology ranks being women. [The Wall Street Journal]

$180,000 per year
Yearly salary that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore received from the Foundation for Moral Law. Moore had preciously claimed he did not take a salary because he did not want to be a burden for the network of donors. Nonetheless he got over a million dollars in compensation from 2007 to 2012. [The Washington Post]

200,000 meals a day
FEMA is providing 200,000 meals a day to Puerto Rico, but officials acknowledge there are 2 million people who need food meaning there’s at least a daily shortfall of 1.8 million to 2.8 million meals ever day. [The Guardian]

$621 million
Amount of money New York doles out in film and television subsidies every year. All told, it’s pretty vague who benefits from this: On one hand, production does come to New York, on the other it’s unclear exactly if the economy comes out ahead, but most of all I saw my bodega once on “Orange Is The New Black” and it threw me for a loop for days.

2-1, Trinidad and Tobago
With a loss to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday, the U.S. Men’s national team has been eliminated from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. The staggering failure is the first time since 1986 the U.S. will be absent from world soccer’s biggest event. [ESPN FC]

31 percent
More and more Americans are identifying as religiously unaffiliated, but it’s not college that’s causing that. A PRRI study found 38 percent of young adults and 24 percent of Americans in general are religiously unaffiliated, but many of those young people are already religiously unaffiliated before showing up to their first college class: The UCLA Freshman Survey found 31 percent of incoming students were unaffiliated. [FiveThirtyEight]

89 percent cut
Michigan Consumers for Health Care, which helps enroll people in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, have seen the Trump administration slash funding for the work by 89 percent, from $1.2 million to $129,000. The cuts are affecting other organizations across the country: The Ohio Association of Foodbanks was hit with a 71 percent cut, Wyoming’s Cheyenne Regional Medical Center saw a 61 percent cut, the Utah Health Policy Project got a 61 percent cut, and the Palmetto Project in South Carolina saw a 46 percent cut.

$133 million
Kobe Steel, the third-largest steel company in Japan, is engulfed in scandal after it said staff falsified data about the durability and strength of the aluminum and copper it sold. The metals have gone on to be used by Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Subaru Corp and used in trains, planes, and possibly spacecraft. One estimate for the cost of replacing the metals is $133 million, but shares for the company already dropped 22 percent and investors are worried the about the risk of the company defaulting on its debts.

$242,500
Estimated gross cost to taxpayers for Vice President Mike Pence to fly a C-32 from Las Vegas to Indianapolis and then to Los Angeles Sunday. The purpose of the trip was so that he could briefly attend and then promptly leave an Indianapolis Colts game citing the ongoing NFL players’ protest of police mistreatment of African-Americans. The RNC will reimburse the government for a portion of the cost of the L.A. leg because the Vice President attended a political event there. [CNN]
