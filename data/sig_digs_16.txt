1 missile
North Korea fired off a ballistic missile on Sunday, but it exploded almost immediately after launching. [The Washington Post]

51 percent
Voters in Turkey passed a referendum giving President Tayyip Erdogan expanded powers and potentially keeping him in office until 2029. But the vote was closer than Erdogan had wanted, with just over 51 percent in favor, and the country’s two major opposition parties promised to contest the results. [BBC]

60 minutes
United Airlines, after violently kicking a man off an overbooked flight so some employees could get somewhere (and reaping the public relations rewards when video of the incident went viral), announced a new policy that would not allow employees to bump passengers from overbooked flights which were already boarded. A spokeswoman told The Times: “We issued an updated policy to make sure crews traveling on our aircraft are booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure.” [The New York Times]

117 years
Emma Morano, of Italy, has passed away at the age of 117. Morano had been the last person alive known to have been born in the 1800s (and therefore also the oldest person in the world). [BBC]

180 meters of ice
Scientists study ice cores to learn about historical atmospheric conditions. The long cylinders of frozen water contain trapped gasses and particles from thousands of years in the past — they’re basically priceless scientific data. Unless the cores melt! A freezer went on the fritz at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, accidentally exposing 180 meters of the Arctic ice to too high heat. [The Guardian]

$532.5 million
Worldwide gross of “The Fate of the Furious,” the eighth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, a new opening-weekend record at the global box office. [Variety]

2 hours
Three teams are trying to break the two-hour marathon barrier. The current record is 2:02:57, so the winner would have to shave off about 2.5 percent of that time. For perspective, Usain Bolt has improved the 100-meter record by 1.6 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 orbits
The Cassini probe will be hurled into Saturn in September, so right now we’re in the “drive it like you stole it” part of the satellite life cycle. Next up is a 22-orbit run through the rings of Saturn, which might damage the satellite, but, hey, it’s on borrowed time anyway and we might learn cool things so why the heck not. [The New York Times]

30 grams
Canada is considering legislation that would let people have up to 30 grams of marijuana and grow up to four plants themselves. Illegally selling it or involving minors in a transaction would carry substantial penalties. [Business Insider]

610,000 crabs
The blood of horseshoe crabs is essential for the development of a number of crucial medical tests. To get it, the biomedical industry harvests blood from 610,000 crabs a year (as of 2012), and the number is rising. They pull about a third of the animals’ blood and put them back in the ocean, but that doesn’t mean the crabs are perfectly healthy. So determining the death rate of returned horseshoe crabs — assumed to be 15 percent but possibly closer to 29 percent — is a necessary avenue of research for the future of health care.

$15.3 million
“The Fate of the Furious,” the latest installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, is out, and one element of the films related to neither alacrity nor ferocity is an unabashed love of Corona beer. Indeed, there’s so much Corona in the series that it may look like product placement. Surprisingly, it is not: Corona hasn’t paid them a dime; the makers of the movies just like Corona, and over the previous seven films the beverage has accumulated some $15.3 million worth of free product placement just by being the beer of choice for Vin Diesel’s friends. [The Ringer]

$6.2 billion
Dish Network dropped a stunning $6.2 billion on wireless airwaves at the latest government auction of spectrum. The move — they were beat out by only T-Mobile — has puzzled analysts. [Bloomberg]

5 years
For at least the past five years, Apple has been working on a way to measure blood glucose levels without having to puncture the skin. It’s a huge unsolved project in biomedical tech, and the first group to solve it will be poised to become the most sought-after supplier for diabetes testing supplies. [CNBC]

35 percent
In order for Russian theaters to show the eagerly anticipated “The Fate of the Furious” movie on time, they were forced by the culture ministry to devote 35 percent of screenings to “Time of the First,” a patriotic historical film about the first spacewalk. Despite the mandatory fun, the film fell short of box-office expectations. But, hey, at least they get their car movie on time. [The Hollywood Reporter]

With goals against Bayern Munich, Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid has become the first soccer player to score 100 goals in UEFA European competition. [Squawka Football]

311
Aggregate number of gear shifts over the course of the first seven Fast and Furious movies. With a new film in the canon out today, Bloomberg has blown the doors off with its deepest-ever analysis of the films, including the findings that they’ve become considerably more furious (more heisting) and less fast (less racing) over time.

Paid advertising time on “The O’Reilly Factor” on April 7, down from 16 minutes and 10 seconds of paid ads on the first weekday after a New York Times report detailed millions in payments to women who alleged sexual harassment and verbal abuse from host Bill O’Reilly. [Variety]

12 aircraft
The Trump administration is considering selling up to 12 light aircraft to Nigeria. The planes would be used to fight Boko Haram. This isn’t the first time the U.S. has sold planes to Nigeria, but the most recent sale was put on hold after a Nigerian fighter jet accidentally bombed a camp for displaced people.

14 gigawatts
Solar energy capacity in California at the end of last year, up from less than 1 gigawatt in 2007. Solar has gotten so ubiquitous in the state that the source is accounting for major chunks of the power generated in its grid system. [The Independent]

27 points
President Trump won in Kansas’s 4th Congressional District by a margin of 27 points in the 2016 presidential election. In Tuesday’s special election to replace Mike Pompeo, now director of the CIA, the Republican candidate for Congress won by only 7 points. That may be bad news for GOP members of Congress in more competitive districts than the 4th. [Kansas Secretary of State, The Wall Street Journal]

Despite an effort that took $300 million and more than 10 years, a United Nations-backed tribunal prosecuting crimes related to the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge led to the conviction of merely three people. [The New York Times]

Number of retail bankruptcies so far in 2017, equal to the number from all of 2016. Brick-and-mortar stores are struggling because of the rise of online shopping, Americans moving their discretionary income to eating out rather than shopping, and malls just not really working like they used to. [The Atlantic]

27 individuals and entities
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced enforcement actions against 27 entities and people who were paid to post bullish articles about biotech stocks and did not disclose that financial relationship.

United Express Flight 3411
A man was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight Sunday, and the brutal affair was caught on video. United had overbooked the flight and did not sort that out before boarding. When a doctor was told he had to leave the flight, he said he did not want to, which ended with him getting bloodied up and dragged off the airplane like an animal. It’s an ongoing story.

7 tests
For the first time, the FDA will now allow genetic analysis start-up 23andMe to administer genetic-disease tests direct to the consumer, without a doctor involved. There are seven tests available, including ones for celiac disease, primary dystonia and hereditary hemochromatosis. The FDA cautioned that the test results should be treated as information, not diagnoses. [MIT Technology Review]

21.9 percent
According to a report from the Brewers Association, small and independent craft brewers remain on the rise, representing 21.9 percent of the beer industry’s retail value last year. [Brewers Association]

30 percent
Here’s some fresh heresy for you: researchers have concluded that escalators move people faster when riders stand two-by-two across, rather than the current social contract where the left is the passing lane. This has been confirmed by several studies: a London Underground analysis found congestion dropped 30 percent when people rode the escalator standing still, side by side. Reading this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to the “wizards are real, kid” moment from Harry Potter. [The New York Times]

59 missiles
Last night the United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian government airbase that was reported to be the launch site for an alleged chemical weapons attack. It’s the first direct military action the U.S. has taken to intervene in Syria’s civil war. [CNN]

A day after its debut, Pepsi pulled a controversial ad that co-opted the imagery of peaceful protest to sell Pepsi’s sugar water. (A Kardashian was also involved.) The ad received an immediate backlash from many online, including Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter. [The Guardian]

34.6 percent
There are 94 federal courts in the U.S., but for those who want to sue a company over patent infringement — a strategy that is a lynchpin of the controversial business model of so-called “patent trolls” — it’s clear where to go. Between 20014 and 2016, 34.6 percent of patent cases were heard in the Eastern District of Texas, a district that has been kinder to infringement claims than others. A case before the Supreme Court could cut down on this kind of forum shopping. [Quartz]

As of this morning, taser-making company Taser is now called Axon, mainly because they’re diversifying to be a body camera business. Sales of police body cameras are up 84.7 percent from 2015 as demand swells across the United States. Of the cities that have adopted body cameras for police, Axon has scored deals with over 85 percent of them. [The Huffington Post]

$8.3 million
Amount raised by Democrat Jon Ossoff in his bid for the special election in Georgia’s sixth congressional district, which is rather stunning; it’s an order of magnitude higher than what any of his GOP rivals hauled in over the same period, and nationwide the average winning House candidate spends $1.5 million. [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Alex Seitz-Wald]

Panera Bread sold to German firm JAB — which also owns Krispy Kreme and Einstein Bros. Bagels — for $7.5 billion. With Chipotle stumbling in the fast casual restaurant sector after E. coli incidents, Panera’s doing very well in the market. [CNN]

The Barkley Marathon is an obscene ultramarathon that only 15 people have ever actually finished. There’s a delightful documentary — “The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young” — that covers one year of it for those interested in watching people in agony. It has to be completed in 60 hours or less, and this year only one runner pulled off the feat. [Running]

21 advertisers
Yesterday we reported that Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz had pulled advertising from “The O’Reilly Factor” because of a report that Fox News had paid out $13 million to several women over alleged sexual harassment and verbal abuse by Bill O’Reilly. Nineteen more advertisers have now followed suit and pulled their ads from the show. [CNN]

Bring a windbreaker if you’re headed to Scotland anytime soon. Wind energy provided 1.2 million megawatt hours of electricity last month, more than enough to power all 3.3 million Scottish households and accounting for 58 percent of the country’s electrical needs. [The Independent]

$8.6 million
A California court ordered that Bossland, a German company specializing in selling multiplayer video game cheats, had to pay game developer Blizzard $8.6 million for copyright infringement because it sold hacks to players of the Blizzard’s “Overwatch” game. The hacks allowed cheaters to see the locations of other players, which I guess had the one advantage of making Widowmaker mains even more irrelevant in the game’s meta, so boo hoo to that I guess.

Percentage of power cables in central Tokyo that are underground, a low number compared to other major cities. Tokyo is hosting the 2020 Olympics, and wants to bury many of those cables underground ahead of the event for aesthetic reasons. But there are practical reasons, too: The country is often rocked by earthquakes, many of them large, and having so many cables above ground poses a potential safety risk. [Bloomberg]

As part of the Affordable Care Act, restaurants with 20 or more locations will soon have to post signs indicating calorie counts for every item and every variation of an item on the menu. If you are Domino’s Pizza, this regulation could get onerous. There are something like 34 million possible ways to order a pizza at Domino’s, according to Domino’s. An executive estimated the signage would set back franchisees several thousand dollars per establishment. [National Review]
