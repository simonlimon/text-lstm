Monopoly, mistakenly assuming that when people called it drearily boring they were talking about something other than the antiquated gameplay, has swapped out three of its game pieces — thimble, boot, wheelbarrow — for three new ones: a rubber duck, a T. rex and a penguin. [CNN]

10.5 gigabytes
Streaming 30 minutes of non-high-definition video daily takes 10.5 gigabytes of mobile data a month on AT&T, according to BTIG Research, which tested what we all wanted to know when it comes to mobile streaming but never had the cash to actually find out. [Bloomberg]

With several high-profile upsets in the second round of the men’s NCAA tournament — including the elimination of Duke, Louisville and pre-tournament favorite Villanova — Gonzaga is the current favorite to win in FiveThirtyEight’s model. This is great news because I have them in the office pool, and the only other person to do that has Louisville in the final, so I’m still in this. [FiveThirtyEight]

119 points
The University of Connecticut’s women’s basketball team — the strong favorite to win the tournament — won its opening-round game by 61 points but nonetheless saw its overall chances of winning decrease. This was because Baylor, UConn’s top rival, beat Texas Southern 119-30, an 89-point margin and an NCAA women’s tournament record. [FiveThirtyEight]

$970
Bitcoin crashed, again. Two camps debating the future of bitcoin and the possibility of a currency split led to the value crashing as low as $970 per BTC on Saturday from a high of $1,259 last week. [The Wall Street Journal]

$4,000
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has purchased $4,000 worth of Canada Goose stock following the apparel company’s initial public offering on Thursday. This is enough skin in the game to submit shareholder resolutions and speak at shareholder meetings, rights that PETA will use to call out the company’s use of animal fur in its products.

USA Hockey pays women who compete in the Olympics only $1,000 per month during the six months every four years that the women play. The athletes say it’s an unsustainable system, and they’re sitting out this month’s Women’s World Championship in protest. [ESPNW]

33 seats
The anti-immigrant and populist Freedom Party did not win the Dutch election, bucking a recent international trend. The Liberal Party is projected to win the most seats — 33 of 150 — in the lower house of the Dutch parliament and form a coalition with other parties. No Netherlexit! [Bloomberg]

Estimated number of Adélie penguins in East Antarctica. Whip that one out at parties when the conversation dies out to get things going again. Really though, that’s 3.6 million more penguins than an earlier estimate, and global warming could pose a threat to the dense population. [National Geographic]

400 million to 800 million tons
By weight, earth’s deadliest hunter is the noble spider, which kills and subsequently consumes 400 million to 800 million tons of prey per year, mainly insects, orcs, and elves. Those last two weren’t actually in the study, which was published in the journal The Science of Nature, but rather an earlier report from the journal “The Lord of the Rings.” [BBC]

That’s the number of human beings who have had sex in space, which is pathetic. We’ve been going to space going on 60 years now and nobody got it done yet? Name literally any other piece of technology that was not nearly immediately parlayed into sexual intercourse. Cell phones, the internet, film, daguerreotypes — all of them were around for only brief periods before being used for sex. And no two people have pulled it off? We’ve got to figure this out before we send humans to Mars or it could be a legitimate issue. [FiveThirtyEight]

New York was hit with a withering if underwhelming winter storm Tuesday, which enabled the daring escape of two ponies in Staten Island. The beasts were captured by a bold citizen as they roamed Richmond county. [Gothamist]

Share of Republicans who do not believe gay and lesbian people face a lot of discrimination in the U.S. Interestingly, more Republicans believed that Christians — who make up more than 70 percent of the population — face a lot of discrimination than believed that gays and lesbians, black Americans, immigrants and Muslims do. [Public Religion Research Institute]

78 percent
A report from the research firm eMarketer found that Google and Facebook are solidifying and even expanding their dominance of the digital advertising market. Google will account for 78 percent of search ad revenue in 2017, while Facebook will get 39 percent of display ad revenue. Everyone else — including the newly public parent company of Snapchat — is fighting over the scraps. [Axios]

CORRECTION (March 15, 2:43 p.m.): An earlier version of this story gave the wrong name for Jordan Peele’s new film. It is “Get Out,” not “The Get Out.”

3 years
When you are Richard Simmons, your fans notice when you fall off the radar. It has been three years since the fitness guru stopped showing up to teach his fitness classes, which has given rise to a long list of rumors and conspiracy theories, including that he is being held hostage by his housekeeper. (Simmons, through his publicist, has denied that and other stories.) A new podcast is exploring the many mysteries regarding Simmons’s disappearance. [The New York Times]

5 days
Why build a house of ice when the weather does it for you? After five days of heavy winds and subzero temperatures, a home in Webster, New York, near Lake Ontario, became encased in ice. Considering the heavy snowfall on the East Coast right now, we could see some impressive igloos to rival the ice house. [The Huffington Post]

$100
Texas state Rep. Jessica Farrar is proposing legislation that would fine men $100 for masturbating and require a 24-hour waiting period for buying Viagra. Farrar introduced the bill, which she calls “A Man’s Right to Know Act,” as a way to call attention to the limited access and strict regulations that women face in getting abortions in Texas. [CNN]

217 weapons
Authorities broke up an alleged weapons trafficking ring after an undercover cop in New York City purchased 217 firearms that had been illegally transported to Brooklyn from Virginia, where gun laws aren’t as strict. So far, 24 people have been arrested in connection with the gun ring. [ABC News]

217 minutes and 14 seconds
A hockey playoff game in Norway went to eight overtimes this weekend, meaning the two teams were on the ice for 217 minutes and 14 seconds. The three-and-a-half hours of playing time translated into more than eight hours of total time for fans, some of whom were reported missing by loved ones. The game is now considered the longest ever in hockey. And we thought the game of baseball was too slow. [NHL]

24 million people
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people would lose their health insurance by 2026 under the American Health Care Act, congressional Republicans’ proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act. If enacted, the AHCA would cut the federal deficit by $337 billion over 10 years but would push the share of Americans without insurance coverage back to pre-ACA levels, according to the CBO.

1 hour
Some business owners in the Northeast question whether we should adjust our clocks for daylight saving time and are urging their states to join a different time zone. A New York Times op-ed writer suggests having a single time zone. So does this mean we agree to abolish “spring forward” in favor of getting back that hour of sleep we lost this weekend?

28 years old
Happy 28th birthday, World Wide Web! You’ve come a long way. But before the cake and ice cream, Tim Berners-Lee, who created you, would like a word with us. He’s concerned about three threats: a lack of control over personal data, misinformation and a lack of transparency in political advertising. We are, too. [Quartz]

46 U.S. attorneys
The Trump administration asked for the resignation of 46 U.S. attorneys, including New York’s Preet Bharara, on Friday. The next day, Bharara said via Twitter that he had been fired after refusing to resign. [The Washington Post]

800 copies
It’s not unusual to own two copies of your favorite vinyl. I’m guilty of this. But Mark Satlof owns more than 800 copies of “The Velvet Underground and Nico,” which is equivalent to about 1 percent of all copies made before 1969. You could call him a die-hard Velvet Underground fan. [NPR]

3,000 years old
A 26-foot ancient statue that is possibly 3,000 years old was found in a Cairo slum by Egyptian and German archaeologists. The quartzite bust and head appears to be modeled after Pharaoh Ramses II, one of Egypt’s most celebrated rulers. [National Geographic]

235,000 jobs
On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the addition of 235,000 jobs to the U.S. economy and an unemployment rate that dropped slightly to 4.7 percent in February. But as FiveThirtyEight’s chief economics writer Ben Casselman explains, these numbers shouldn’t be attributed to President Trump’s economic policies. [FiveThirtyEight]

$854,000 in damage
Radioactive boars, contaminated as a result of the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011, are causing havoc in parts of Japan — they’ve done about $854,000 in agricultural damage in Fukushima prefecture. Officials are even worried that the boars will attack people who are returning home to towns that were evacuated. So, that’s horrifying. [The New York Times]

Edith Fuller goes to Washington. The 5-year-old from Tulsa will be heading to D.C. for the Scripps National Spelling Bee. She’s the youngest ever to qualify for the nation’s premier phonemic orthographic competition, which will be held in late May and early June. Edith spelled 37 words in her regional qualifying bee, including philately, Baedeker, jnana and Weimaraner. [KJRH]

38 Trump trademarks
The Chinese government has preliminarily approved 38 Trump trademarks, which cover hotels, golf clubs and concierge services. While a director at a Hong Kong intellectual property outfit told the Associated Press that he’d never seen so many trademark applications approved so quickly, any special treatment in trademark rights received by President Trump would violate the U.S. Constitution, experts said. [AP]

303 counties
A$AP Rocky, one of the great musical geniuses of our time, told us in his 2011 track “Purple Swag” that “everything is purple.” David Wasserman, writing for this website, disagrees. Purple America — those counties that don’t vote super red or super blue — is disappearing. In fact, of the nation’s 3,113 counties (or county equivalents), only 303 were decided by single-digit percentage points in the most recent presidential election. In contrast, 1,096 counties were purple by that standard in the 1992 election. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,000-to-1 odds
Last month, the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, besting the Atlanta Falcons. This was quite a surprise, at least when the fourth quarter started given Atlanta’s 28-9 lead. But just how big a surprise depends on the model you looked at. Some projections put New England’s chances at their nadir at 25-1, while others had them as 1,000-1 dogs. As the statistician George Box is often credited with saying: “All models are wrong but some are useful.” [StatsbyLopez]

20,669 words
On their face, the iTunes terms and conditions don’t really make for engrossing reading. But the 20,669-word document has, overcoming somewhere between 25-1 and 1,000-1 odds, been transformed into the “year’s hottest graphic novel,” in an adaptation by the author Robert Sikoryak. The late Steve Jobs appears on each page of the book, as a famous comic book character, rattling off the dense legalese. [The Guardian]

30 billion light years
From a galaxy called A2744_YD4, some 30 billion light years from where you’re reading this, astronomers have identified the “characteristic heat emanations” of dust. This very, very old dust — which you or I might sweep aside like so much … old dust — is important evidence of the early births and violent deaths of stars after the Big Bang. [The New York Times]

2 bankruptcies
RadioShack is reportedly preparing to seek bankruptcy protection. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it happened last year as well. This would be RadioShack’s second bankruptcy filing in two years. Perhaps — and I’m just spitballing here — there just isn’t a big enough market of people that prefer to obtain their electronics equipment from a shack. [The Wall Street Journal]

8.5 percent
The tariff for importing blankets into the U.S. is 8.5 percent. It’s 14.9 percent for “pullover apparel.” Where does this leave the notorious Snuggie, the blanket you wear like a shameful little poncho? That’s up to the U.S. Court of International Trade to decide. The government wants to tax the Snuggie like clothing. Allstar Marketing Group, which makes the Snuggie, isn’t having it. [The Washington Post]

39 minutes and 35 seconds
A Martian day is 39 minutes and 35 seconds longer than an Earth day. That extra bit there means any poor sap we send to the Red Planet will live in a constant state of jet lag the entire time. Let’s see you botany your way out of that one, Damon. [FiveThirtyEight]

1.5 million potential voters
Number of Turks living in Germany who are eligible to vote in Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey wants those expats to vote in favor of a new Constitution that would give him more power, and Germany’s leadership — which is dealing with a number of geopolitical issues regarding Turkey — would vastly prefer he did not get those powers. As The Times put it: “Mr. Erdogan’s opponents in Germany, both Turkish and German, say the president wants to use the freedoms of Western democracy to further consolidate his anti-democratic powers at home.” [The New York Times]

6 million tons
A Singapore-based company is buying up an immense amount of sugar on the U.S. futures exchange — 6 million tons since 2015 to the tune of $2.3 billion. What, precisely, Wilmar International intends to do with all that sucrose is not exactly clear, and it’s stirring debate among traders around the world. [The Wall Street Journal]

5-3
The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 on Monday that verdicts could be thrown out due to racial bias during jury deliberations. The case revolved around a Colorado man convicted of sexual battery and a juror who made derogatory comments about Mexicans during the deliberations. Those comments came to light only after the verdict. [USA Today]

7 GOP senators
House Republicans have introduced their version of an Affordable Care Act repeal. It involves scrapping the individual mandate, rolling back the Medicaid expansion and overhauling the way tax credits are awarded. It’s complicated stuff, and just the first bid in what’s likely to be a long negotiation. Indeed, seven GOP senators have taken issue with the House bill — four who said the bill didn’t adequately protect constituents benefitting from Medicaid, and three who took the conservative line that the bill was too generous. [The New York Times, Vox]

Percentage of U.S. dams that will be more than 50 years old by the year 2025. A dam is considered “high hazard” if its failure would kill people; 15,500 dams in America are “high hazard.” [E&E News]

883 cubic feet
Here’s the thing with going to Mars: It’s going to be really really cramped. Current recommendations for an eventual habitat are at least 883 cubic feet per person, or 5,300 cubic feet for a six person crew. For comparison, the International Space Station is 15,000 cubic feet, and even thats a bit of a tin can. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,000 coins
A green sea turtle in Thailand is recovering after undergoing surgery on Monday to remove the nearly 1,000 coins it had consumed. The turtle lived in a pool in Sri Racha where tourists would throw coins for luck. Approximately 11 pounds of metal were removed. “It is hard to imagine how it swallowed such a large number of coins,” said an extremely judgmental veterinarian who apparently has never heard of stress eating.
