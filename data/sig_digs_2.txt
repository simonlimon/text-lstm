4.8 percent
A Color of Change study examining 234 television shows has found that only 4.8 percent of the 3,817 staff writers were black. Indeed, two-thirds of television shows didn’t employ a single black writer. [The Hollywood Reporter]

23 percent
That’s the percentage of food waste that qualifies as prepared foods and leftovers, the second-highest source of trashed food (inedible food parts are number one). Turns out that Americans aren’t eating leftovers anymore, which could pose a bit of a waste management problem. [The Washington Post]

63 percent
An American Psychological Association study found that 63 percent of Americans are stressed about the future of the nation, a concern beating out both money and work stressors, and one that cuts across partisan lines. Grimly, 59 percent consider it the lowest point in the nation’s history they can recall, a figure that holds regardless of generation. [Bloomberg]

2030
It’s projected that by 2030 Catholics will become a religious minority in Brazil. One contributing cause to this is the rise of Pentecostal churches throughout Latin America and Africa: a quarter of Brazilians are Pentecostal, and that number is going up. One American export — the prosperity gospel, which says the more money you give to the church the more money you will get back — is selling very well in Brazil. [The Washington Post]

33,500 mining jobs
That’s the number of mining jobs lost in the Appalachian region since 2011, and how to fix that job deficit is a bit of catch-22. Due to the price of coal relative to the price of other ways to make power, it’s unlikely that the market is going to require 33,500 more people to mine coal. One solution is to retrain miners for other jobs, but herein lies the pickle: On one hand, why would miners enter retraining courses when there are no immediate job prospects near their home in the new discipline? On the other, why would employers who need trained employees move to a place where there are no such trained employees? This chicken and egg problem is making it difficult to help improve the economy of coal country through retraining. [Reuters]

$4.5 trillion balance sheet
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has raised borrowing costs four times since 2015, and she has begun to reduce the amount of money on the Fed’s balance sheet (a cool $4.5 trillion as of this summer). That work appears like it will be continued by Jerome Powell, reportedly President Trump’s pick for the chair. [Bloomberg]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news.

3 members
One Direction will join The Beatles as the only bands that can say three of their members have chart-topping solo albums. Thus “Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Zayne Malik are right up there with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison,” is a technically true sentence that has been weaponized to alienate Baby Boomers. More significantly, my personal quest to find out who was the Ringo of 1D has narrowed to two final contenders, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson. I still contend Harry Styles is the McCartney, as he just screams “overrated Bond song in a few years.” [Variety]

16.2 percent
That’s the percentage of visitors to Uluru — the Australian geological formation previously known as Ayer’s Rock — who climb it on a given day. Starting in October 2019, the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board will ban the practice of climbing the formation, which has spiritual meaning for some Aboriginal Australians. [Business Insider Australia]

30 years
Carles Puigdemont was the president of Catalonia, the region that attempted to break away from Spain. Spain’s Attorney General has called for charges of sedition and rebellion to be filed against Puigdemont and his fellow secessionists. This would carry a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison. Puigdemont has since fled to Belgium. [Vox]

63 percent
The Cato Institute is out with a staggering new report on the state of free speech in the United States. One disconcerting trend: 11 percent of Democrats, 38 percent of independents and 63 percent of Republicans said they believed that journalists today are an enemy of the American people. Yeesh. [Cato]

97 out of 25,000 establishments
That’s the number of eating and drinking establishments in New York City that have a cabaret license, which is a city document that allows the establishment to host “musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement” without running afoul of the law. This technically means that you probably can’t dance in that bar you thought you could dance in, legally speaking. The law dates back to 1926, back when a couple good-time Charlies and floorflushers couldn’t jitterbug with some flappers in a standard nosebaggery without risking a trip to the hoosegow, you see? But now people in Brooklyn want to dance at bars and the law looks like it will likely get struck down by the City Council. [The New York Times]

620,000
Wall Street has dumped billions of dollars into restaurants to fuel growth, and we probably have too many restaurants as a result: restaurants are growing twice as fast as the population, tallying 620,000 establishments as of the last count. But demand does not expand just because supply does̉. When you get down to it, the invisible hand of the market can only shove one burger into the invisible face of the market at a given time. [The New York Times]

6 service members
On Monday, a U.S. district court judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration’s plan to ban transgender service members from serving in the armed forces. There are already significant numbers of trans Americans serving, and six active-duty service members sued in August to block the policy. [The Washington Post]

14 percent
Approval rating for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey according to a new Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll. If that poll is accurate, it would nudge Christie further into the record books: he’s currently the third most unpopular governor for whom polls can be found. [Harry Enten, Suffolk University, FiveThirtyEight]

33 percent
The Gallup tracking survey released Monday had the president’s approval rating at 33 percent, a new low. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 percent
Facebook’s new attempt to have third-party fact checking groups vet the content the company spreads on news feeds hasn’t been going well, according to a new report from Bloomberg. When two fact checking groups flag an item as false it tags the link as “disputed,” which cuts the number of people who see the hoax or misinformation by about 80 percent. However, this has only happened for around 2,000 links, a small fraction of the hundreds of potentially false stories screeners see every day. Factor in that the process typically takes over three days, and you’re not exactly mitigating the spread of false information. [Bloomberg]

$10 million
Federal prosecutors are asking for a $10 million bail to be set for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and $5 million for Rick Gates. Both men pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Monday. Manafort is a wealthy man with allegedly millions of dollars in offshore accounts, according to information detailed in the indictment. [FiveThirtyEight, The Washington Post]

126 million people
That’s Facebook’s estimate for the number of people who may have seen content spread by a Kremlin-linked troll farm between June 2015 and August 2017. The content was intended to spread divisive political messaging on topics including LGBT rights, race issues and gun rights. [CNN Money]

2 indictments
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election has produced its first two indictments Monday. Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, Manafort’s former business partner, are expected to turn themselves in. FiveThirtyEight will have ongoing coverage of the indictments, and the political fallout, all day. [FiveThirtyEight]

9.9 percent
Constellation Brands, the U.S. distributor of Corona beer, will take a 9.9 percent stake in Canopy Growth Corp., a marijuana company based in Canada that is now the largest publicly traded pot company. [The Wall Street Journal]

161 people
It’s been only a few weeks since a mass shooting in Las Vegas claimed the lives of 58 people, and the road to recovery is still long for the 161 people who survived despite being shot. In addition to those who suffered injuries related to trampling, some people will spend the rest of their lives in a wheelchair as a result of bullet wounds sustained in the shooting. [The New York Times]

15 million square feet
That’s the amount of office space being added in Manhattan between 2017 and 2019 according to a new report from the New York Building Congress. A further 2 million square feet going up in Brooklyn and Queens in the same time period. Right now Midtown Manhattan is enjoying a rent decrease as the market absorbs new supply and more competition. [Bloomberg]

$300 million
Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cancelled a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, a tiny firm that has ties to the Trump administration. About 70 percent of Puerto Rico remains without power in the wake of hurricanes hitting the U.S. territory. [The Huffington Post]

$800 billion
Since its first day of trading ten years ago, PetroChina Co., a state-owned energy producer and the first trillion-dollar company on Earth, has lost $800 billion worth of market value. It’s the largest ever destruction of shareholder wealth in dollar terms. The shares are expected to decline 16 percent over the next 12 months. [Bloomberg]

20 deals
Less than 15 percent of first-look producer deals with the six major studios are with production companies led by women, a new report from Variety found. Out of 139 such deals — in which the studio pays overhead and provides some cash in exchange for first dibs on the film — only 20 were with companies helmed by women. That number has barely changed recently. [Variety]

1 interstellar visitor
We have a visitor! Late Thursday, astronomers announced that they’ve spotted a space rock from another star cruising through our solar system. It’s the first time we’ve caught an interstellar asteroid or comet visiting the neighborhood. Scientists are provisionally calling the object A/2017 U1. They’re not sure if it’s mostly rock or ice yet, but it’s about a half-kilometer in size and flying at just over 40 kilometers per second. [Scientific American]

40 nuclear reactors
Wind power generation in Germany is predicted to go nuts on Sunday, reaching a projected 39,190 megawatts at 7 a.m.. That’s roughly 40 nuclear reactors worth of power. [Bloomberg]

95,000 workers
United Parcel Service is adding 95,000 seasonal workers for the holidays. The company expects holiday season deliveries will rise 5 percent, to 750 million, this time around. On an average day, UPS handles 19 million packages, a figure that roughly doubles around the holidays. [Bloomberg]

$900 million
Next year, the Smithsonian Institution will begin a seven-year, $900 million total renovation of the National Air and Space Museum. The first new exhibits are planned to open in 2021. Construction will cost $650 million, and new exhibits will cost $250 million. The museum cost $40 million to build in the first place, in the 1970s (roughly $176 million in today’s dollars). [The Washington Business Journal]

$66 billion
CVS Health Corp. is looking into buying the insurer Aetna for something in the ballpark of $66 billion. It could be the biggest M&A deal of the year if it pans out. [The Wall Street Journal]

More than 20 Republicans
Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey has raised a red flag on GOP plans to eliminate the state and local income tax deduction as part of their tax reform plan. Deducting state and local taxes disproportionately benefits constituents in states that have higher state and local taxes, such as New York and New Jersey. MacArthur estimates that there are more than 20 Republicans in the House opposed to getting rid of the deduction, and they’re making noise about voting against a budget resolution scheduled to come up Thursday that would pave the way for tax reform. [Bloomberg]

45 states
Walgreens is now stocking an FDA-approved nasal form of naloxone in all of its pharmacies nationwide. Naloxone reverses the effects of opioids and can stymie an overdose. The drug, Narcan, is obtainable without a prescription in 45 states. [The Daily Herald]

70 percent
Vaping is becoming illegal indoors in the entirety of New York State. Previously, 70 percent of municipalities had banned the use of electronic cigarettes inside. The remaining 30 percent will now get to go to the mall in peace, without a bunch of teenagers blowing plumes of nicotine-laced, apple-berry-popcorn vapor into their faces. At least cigarette smoke had the decency of dissipating rather than remaining fog-like at sidewalk level. [BBC]

$70
A National Parks Service proposal would raise the cost to drive into a national park from $25-$30 to $70, as well as double the cost for people entering the park on foot. The proposal would apply to 17 national parks during the 2018 peak season. [CNN]

0 Standing Committee members
China’s new Politburo Standing Committee was revealed on Tuesday, with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang the only two holdovers and five new ministers. Two interesting things to note: First, this is the first time that the Standing Committee has zero members born before the 1949 Communist revolution. Second, there is no obvious successor to Xi among the group. [Reuters]

20 months
“Geostorm,” the timeless story of a globe-spanning natural disaster and the attractive man (Gerard Butler) who tried to stop it, tanked at the box office. It hauled in just $14.7 million domestically and $66.8 million worldwide on a budget of $120 million (including $15 million for reshoots). This is a huge disappointment. To begin with, “Geostorm” was initially scheduled for release nearly 20 months ago. Also, its break-even point is upwards of $300 million, which by my calculations is way bigger than $67 million. [The Wrap]

38 percent
Sen. Jeff Flake announced yesterday that he would not seek re-election. That doesn’t mean a ton for the U.S. Senate race in Arizona in 2018 — at least not yet. It’s still perhaps the Democrats’ best pickup opportunity in the upcoming midterms, although still not a slam dunk. A HighGround Public Affairs survey found likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kyrsten Sinema slightly ahead of potential GOP nominee Kelli Ward, 32 percent to 31 percent, but with 38 percent of respondents still undecided. [FiveThirtyEight]

49.8 percent
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of Boston’s forthcoming mayoral election found that half of respondents had personally met Mayor Marty Walsh. Retail politics still means something up there, it would appear. Which is nice … I’ve never met New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. [The Boston Globe]

51 votes
With Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote, Senate Republicans successfully passed legislation killing a rule that would have allowed Americans to form class-action lawsuits against banks and credit card companies. The rule was created after the 2008 financial crisis to combat arbitration clauses inserted into contracts that prevented people from pooling resources and suing financial institutions in class-action suits. It was set to take effect in 2019. [The New York Times]

247 million hectoliters of wine
Catastrophe: The planet will produce only 247 million hectoliters of wine, one of the better things that Earth manages to make, this year. That’s the lowest production level in more than 50 years, and down 8 percent from last year. Extreme weather in the three nations that produce the most wine is to blame. [BBC]

7.4 feet or more
A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that floods of at least 7.4 feet could hit the New York area once every five years from 2030 to 2045. Floods of that magnitude hit New York about once every 25 years now. (Before 1800, they hit once every 500 years.) [Bloomberg]

40 percent
After Purdue Pharmaceuticals — which is partially owned by the secretive Sackler family — changed the formulation of OxyContin pills to make them more difficult to grind into an even-more-abusable powder, prescriptions apparently fell by 40 percent. The explosion of OxyContin use has fueled a devastating opiate epidemic in the United States, and if plans to market the drug abroad succeed, potentially other parts of the world too. [The New Yorker]

45 comments
A military judge will soon decide the fate of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and President Trump’s comments about Bergdahl may have some bearing on that decision. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in 2009 after leaving his base under questionable circumstances. He has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. His counsel, though, has made a renewed push for the case to be dismissed, raising questions about whether Bergdahl received a fair trial given that Trump has called him a traitor on at least 45 different occasions. [NPR]

61 percent
Percentage of Americans who think John F. Kennedy was not killed by Lee Harvey Oswald alone, according to a SurveyMonkey poll conducted for FiveThirtyEight. Later this week, a final batch of government documents related to the assassination may be released. These will presumably prove my theory: The CIA — which was invented by the Mafia with the dual goals of making frogs gay and also rigging the 1985 NBA draft lottery — foiled simultaneous Communist and anti-Communist assassination plots orchestrated by the original Paul McCartney to cover up the truth that Magneto did it. Or maybe it was Oswald. [FiveThirtyEight]

$149 song
A Canadian man was reportedly slapped with a $149 (Canadian dollars) ticket for screaming in public after he was pulled over singing along to “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory at what most would consider a perfectly acceptable volume. [CTV News]

162 candidates
In a third-quarter fundraising performance that’s getting attention from both sides of the aisle, at least 162 Democratic congressional candidates competing in 82 districts currently held by a Republican have raised over $100,000 so far. That’s a solid gauge for aggregate candidate quality this early in the cycle, and is about four times as many well-funded candidates as Democrats had at the same point in the 2016 and 2014 election cycles. It’s twice as many as Republicans fielded at the same point in the 2010 cycle that swept them into power in the House. [POLITICO]

3 warm winters
NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center released its winter temperature forecast and it appears that most of the U.S. is poised for a warmer-than-usual winter. Should that pan out, this will be the third warmer-than-average winter in a row. [NPR]

24-hour ready alert
For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the Air Force is reportedly making preparations to put its nuclear-armed B-52 bombers back on a 24-hour alert posture. That includes the installation of new beds for more than 100 crew members. [Defense One]

43 percent
Percentage of people who took the California bar exam in July, 2016, who passed, compared to nearly 62 percent in 2008. California’s minimum score of 144 is the second highest in the country, and law school deans want it lowered to be more in line with other states. [AP News]

56 percent
A new class action lawsuit against General Electric alleges that the company managed its 401(k) plan to benefit itself, steering employees into funds that were managed by a subsidiary. Those funds charged high fees and went on to underperform investment markets. As The Los Angeles Times wrote, “Of the retirement plan’s $28.5 billion in assets as of the end of 2015, the lawsuit asserts, about half was invested in mutual funds. Of the mutual fund assets, about 56% were invested in five GE-owned funds — all but one of which underperformed its benchmark investment index.” [The Los Angeles Times]

$10 million
Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is dropping “well over $10 million” on a nationwide television ad campaign calling for President Trump’s impeachment. Steyer is also considering mounting a primary campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year. [CNN]

$32 million
On Friday, The New York Times reported a previously unknown settlement between Bill O’Reilly and a network analyst who accused him of harassment, sharing sexually explicit material and a “nonconsensual sexual relationship.” The settlement — the sixth we now know of involving O’Reilly and largest — was for $32 million, and occurred just about a month before Fox renewed his contract for $25 million a year for four years.

Apple shares dropped nearly 3 percent on reports that wireless carriers were not selling as many iPhone 8s as they had expected and claims in Taiwanese media that production on the phone had been cut by half. [Reuters, 9to5 Mac]

17 percent
Percentage of United Airlines revenue that comes from markets where low-cost carriers operate, one reason cited in the stock’s 17 percent tank this year. Airlines like Delta and American have seen 6 percent and 10 percent gains, respectively. Oh, hey, maybe — and I am just throwing this out there — a medical professional getting beaten up and forcibly removed from a flight wasn’t a brilliant business move either. [CNBC]

Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer found a 31-mile-long structurally sound chasm below the surface of the moon that could very well contain water or ice deposits. [The Guardian]
