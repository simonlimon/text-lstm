1st
Kyrgyzstani weightlifter Izzat Artykov was the first Olympian to be stripped of a medal earned at the Rio games. Artykov, who won bronze in 69-kilogram weightlifting, tested positive for the stimulant drug strychnine. The medal now goes to Luis Javier Mosquera Lozano of Colombia. [Yahoo Sports]

2nd consecutive medal
In better news, Ashton Eaton won the Olympic decathlon Thursday night with 8,893 points, earning his second consecutive gold medal. Only two other men have won the gold twice. [The New York Times]

22 percent
Share of U.S. methane emissions that come from livestock, with a further eight percent coming from their poop. This has spurred a lot of funding into “regenerative agriculture,” which will find ways to capture or reduce that methane before it is vented. [Bloomberg]

65 percent
Donald Trump had an average unfavorable rating of 58 percent back in January. That has since risen to 65 percent. This could pose a problem for the nominee, as people typically like to vote for people they think of favorably. [FiveThirtyEight]

223,271 permits
I am endlessly fascinated by New York City’s largely improvised infrastructure system. Seriously, what’s going on a few feet underground is a serpentine, unmapped knot of steam pipes, telecommunications wiring and power-, gas-, sewer- and water-lines — and we haven’t even mentioned the subways. So a piece detailing all the individual reasons every street in the city gets ripped apart is just catnip to me. In 2015, the city gave 223,271 permits to people who wanted to get under the asphalt. [The New York Times]

$350,000
Approximate amount of money Mother Jones spent on an investigation into America’s private prisons. On Thursday, the Justice Department announced it would no longer contract with private contractors to run prisons. The aggregate financial gain of this story for Mother Jones, though, was about $5,000 in banner ads. [Mother Jones]

0.06 percent
NPR is shutting down its comments, and really you can’t blame them after checking out the actual numbers: Despite nearly 33 million users and 491,000 comments in July, all the comments were from a mere 19,400 users, or 0.06 percent of visitors to NPR.org. What’s more, the top 4,300 users posted 67 percent of the comments in the past two months. Take it to Twitter folks, or just send me a nasty email directly; it is honestly faster. [NPR]

4 pot brownies
An Omaha man ate four brownies that turned out to be pot brownies his kid left in the back of the car. According to a report in the Omaha World-Herald, the police were called after he started freaking out — understandable after Maureen Dowd-ing — and paramedics said he’d be fine. The man is on record as saying incredibly rude things to his cat before taking a nap. This is the greatest news story ever. [Omaha World-Herald]

61 percent
Percentage of people in the U.S. who agree racism against black Americans is widespread, according to a Gallup survey. [Gallup]

80 percent
Sure, all eyes are glued to the slow-motion car accident that is the U.S. presidential election, but there’s a far more consequential election going on too: Eighty percent of state legislative seats are up this cycle, and there could be profound shifts given what is going on at the top of the ticket. [FiveThirtyEight]

239 bouts
Number of amateur boxing bouts at the Rio games so far. The international association “responsible” for the sport said Wednesday that it had sent several judges and referees home after questionable decisions in Olympic matches. The move followed a Tuesday fight in which Irishman Michael Conlan lost on a decision to Russian Vladimir Nikitin despite dominating the match in the eyes of many viewers. After the fight, Conlan called out the governing body for blatant misconduct, alleging the fight had been rigged. [The New York Times]

524 square feet
One way Walmart has managed to increase profits is to cut costs when it comes to employees who walk the floor. The company has an average of one employee per 524 square feet of retail space; the amount of space per employee is up 19 percent from a decade ago. Here’s the issue though: With fewer employees to keep an eye out, there’s more crime going down in Walmart stores, and local police departments can be stretched thin. [Bloomberg]

4.3 percent
Dick’s Sporting Goods reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday. But the retailer also owns Golf Galaxy, the canary in the coal mine of the increasingly dire golf business. Same-store sales were down 4.3 percent last quarter at the golf chain, while analysts only expected a dip of 1.5 percent. [Bloomberg]

6 points
A Public Policy Polling survey of the state of Texas found that Donald Trump leads in the state by a mere 6 points over rival Hillary Clinton. The Democrat actually leads Trump 49-45 among voters under the age of 65. [PPP]

1.0 million
Number of viewers who tuned in to Fox on Friday to watch the Yankees take on the Rays in Alex Rodriguez’s final game. It’s nice to be reminded that New York City is not America, because that is a dismal damn rating, losing to the 1.2 million people who watched the previous week’s contest, a rerun of “Masterchef.” [Sports Media Watch]

$1 million
While Playboy Enterprises sold the Playboy Mansion to a neighbor for $100 million, the deal stipulates that Hugh Hefner, a known sex-haver, gets to live in the mansion as long as he wants to. His previous rent was apparently $100 per year, but the new owner is now charging $1 million per year for the rental. Given that pornography is now often found free on the internet, and apparently has been for some time, I am worried for Hef. It sucks getting priced out of a prime apartment. [Business Insider]

$1.69 million
If you are the type of person who would like to buy a helicopter, now is the best time in a while. A pre-owned 2010 Bell 407 helicopter is 13 percent cheaper now than it was two years ago, according to a helicopter appraisal firm, which is a type of business I didn’t know existed until now. For the cool price of $1.69 million you, your mining concern or your corporation can own such a model of helicopter. [Quartz]

$135 million
Gawker Media was sold Tuesday at an auction to Univision for $135 million. The bankrupt online publisher was for sale due to a Peter Thiel-funded Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to a $140 million judgement against the company and owner Nick Denton. A judge still has to approve the deal. [Recode]

0.72 million
Average 2016 viewership of “The Nightly Show,” which Comedy Central announced Monday would be canceled following Thursday’s show. The program, hosted by Larry Wilmore, replaced “The Colbert Report” after “The Daily Show.” [The Wall Street Journal]

1 per month
Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, has banned cars one day per month. The drive to create safer and cleaner cities is enviable, as literally Sunday night I saw somebody on 31st Avenue in Astoria run over a garbage bag full of what must have been — based on my on-the-ground-reporting — fish and chicken carcasses. So kudos to you, Kigali. [Quartz]

9 charges
Pennsylvania’s attorney general was convicted of nine charges related to her leaking grand jury information about a political rival and then lying about it. [The New York Times]

15 detainees
The U.S. transferred 15 Guantánamo Bay detainees to the United Arab Emirates on Monday, leaving only 61 people detained at the facility. Closing Guantánamo — the herpes of U.S. foreign policy — was a campaign promise of then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008. [The Guardian]

62 percent
According to a USA TODAY/Rock the Vote survey, 62 percent of Americans ages 18 to 35 say that transgender people should be allowed to use the public bathroom of the gender with which they identify, an issue that somehow became a big deal shortly after the passage of same-sex marriage for no reason whatsoever. [USA Today]

70 percent
Based on a coding system developed by whatever ISIS’s equivalent of human resources is, 70 percent of recruits in 2013 to 2014 had at most a basic knowledge of Islam. According to a trove of more than 3,000 leaked documents, only 5 percent of recruits indicated they had an advanced knowledge of the world’s largest religion before signing on to the group. [The Associated Press]

2 sets of twins, 1 set of triplets
At least two sets of twins and one set of triplets ran the Rio marathon — a pair of twins from North Korea, another pair from Germany and a set of triplets from Estonia. [Let’s Run]

3 medals
Simone Biles won her third medal of the Olympic Games Sunday with the individual vault event, a U.S. record for the most medals won in women’s gymnastics. Oh, all three of Biles’s medals are gold. [NPR]

101 yards
The long-awaited — well, by someone, I’m sure? — return of the Rams to Los Angeles got off to an inauspicious start Sunday when Dallas’s Lucky Whitehead returned the opening kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown. It was the Rams’ first (preseason) game in L.A. in more than two decades. [@NFL]

193 people
The personal cell phone numbers of 193 current and former members of Congress, all Democrats, were posted online by the hacker(s?) going by “Guccifer 2.0.” So if you’ve been sexting a congressman, I have some bad news. [The Wall Street Journal]

1,000
When the U.S. won its 23rd gold medal of the 2016 Olympic Games, American athletes also hit a major milestone: 1,000 cumulative gold medals for the nation since the founding of the modern games in 1896. [The Washington Post]

$2.2 million
Why, let’s do the math real quick here: Through the end of June, the joint fundraising account between the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump’s campaign had given $2.2 million to the presidential nominee’s bid and $10.1 million to the RNC. Does this lend credibility to hints that the RNC will call the presidential race a loss and focus on congressional races and the Senate if things look really bad come October? Who can say.

5 percent
That’s the percentage of physicians in the United States who are Muslim. According to a study published in 2015, one in 10 of those doctors has had a patient refuse care based on the doctor’s faith. [The Washington Post]

62.198
Simone Biles, the national hero, has won Olympic gold with a score of 62.198 in the individual all-around artistic gymnastics event. Her teammate Aly Raisman got silver. Biles is the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in the event. [ABC News]

67 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit
All right, so make a mental list of places where you would like to exercise. For me, this list is empty. But for you, it might contain any number of scenic locations. Right now, Olympic marathon runners will have to contend with, among other things, running 26.2 miles in proximity to the equator. I think we can all agree that this notion sucks, and science agrees too. The temperature for the women’s marathon Sunday in Rio de Janeiro is forecast to be 67 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:30 a.m. The reality is that the marathon would be far better — by which I mean faster, because faster is always better — if it were in the Winter Games. [FiveThirtyEight]

70+
More than 70 Republicans signed a letter asking the Republican National Committee to stop using its money to help Donald Trump win the presidential election. Presumably unrelated: Top Trump advisers are getting together with RNC officials for an “emergency meeting” Friday. [Politico]

140 degrees
Heat index in parts of the United Arab Emirates and Iran during July, which is a global obscenity. I was recently [read: last night] in a bar that was slightly more than 75 degrees and left on moral grounds. Not even I can drink in such conditions. [The Washington Post]

£9 billion
Hugh Richard Louis Grosvenor is now the third-wealthiest landowner in the United Kingdom after the death of his father, the 6th Duke of Westminster. Although he does have two older sisters, apparently primogeniture was still a thing when the kid was born. The 25-year-old has more money than you ever will, probably. [The Guardian]

1st place
Ryan Catalfu of North Carolina on Wednesday won the Microsoft Office Specialist World Championship event for PowerPoint 2013, which is seriously a real competition. Certiport, the company that certifies people in Microsoft Office proficiency, holds the annual international competition and got an honest-to-god astronaut to talk at the shindig. [Atlas Obscura]

19 percent
Percentage of registered Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll who said they think Donald Trump should drop out of the presidential race. Typically, the whole point of a convention and campaign is to, er, get that number a fair bit lower than this. [Reuters]

21st floor
A person tried to climb Trump Tower in New York City using suction cups Wednesday. He got to the 21st floor, where police had removed window panes to cut the climber off, and that’s where police hauled him in. I would love to make a joke here, but Twitter got all the good ones Wednesday. [ABC News]

150 pounds
A tortoise named Elwood that made a mad dash to freedom from its owner’s home in York County, Virginia, was captured by authorities and turned over to a holding cell at the Peninsula SPCA & Petting Zoo in Newport News. It is 17 years old and weighs 150 pounds. Listen, people, it was either this or another Trump item, so we’re just going to stick with the tortoise, all right? [The Virginia Gazette]

2,168 years
U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps won his 12th individual Olympic gold medal this week, tying a record set 2,168 years ago by Leonidas of Rhodes. [Deadspin]

12.2 medals
What’s the home-field advantage for a Summer Olympic Games host? Pretty significant, it turns out. Compared with the team’s performance in the Summer Games four years before, on average the overall medal count was 20.1 higher, with 10.9 more golds, for the nation hosting the games. But when you exclude the years where the games were affected by Soviet Union or U.S. boycotts — man, the ’80s were weird, what were you people thinking? — the average jump shrinks to 12.2 medals for the home team with 6.8 additional golds. [FiveThirtyEight]

16 years
The longest hunger strike ever has come to a close, with India’s Irom Sharmila eating for the first time since 2000. She started the strike to protest laws giving powers to the military after 10 people were killed by Indian soldiers in the state of Manipur. Sharmila now says she wants to run for office. [CNN]

319
Prince Fielder of the Texas Rangers, after a neck injury, might be at the end of his career. If he is, he’ll finish with 319 career home runs, the same number hit by his father, Cecil. [Jared Diamond, SB Nation]

9,726
Number of registered lobbyists in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2016, down from a high of almost 15,000 in 2007. Spending on lobbying is down across the board, to $779 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with $821 million in the same quarter last year. [The Center for Responsive Politics]

100,000 shares
Jet.com, an e-commerce site, sold to Wal-Mart Stores for $3.3 billion. One guy who had nothing to do with the founding or business of the site will likely get a massive windfall from that sale: Eric Martin won a competition to recruit people to sign up for Jet.com and got 100,000 shares as a prize. He could make tens of millions of dollars from the sale. [Bloomberg]

2 million
Estimated number of cocaine users in the United States. A vaccine is being tested that could treat coke addiction. As a New Yorker who works in media, I think this is fantastic news — I’ve been worried about missing out on the great conversations some of my friends seem to be having in the bathroom while I’m not paying attention.

Fun fact: Only about 3 percent of the 11 million containers that arrive at U.S. ports are screened with X-rays, despite the security risk a container full of nuclear or radiological material could pose. Wait. That fact isn’t fun at all. Damn. [The Atlantic]

6 games
This is skeet shooter Kim Rhode’s sixth Summer Olympics competing for the United States, making her the American on the current roster who has competed in the most consecutive games for Team USA. If she medals, she’ll become the first person to do so in six consecutive games. [FiveThirtyEight]

Age of Emperor Akihito of Japan. The monarch wants to step down and cede the post to his son, but the fraught political situation in Japan has many wondering whether the government will accept his wishes. [The New York Times]

Hillary Clinton is rather far ahead in our polls-only election forecast model after the Democratic National Convention: She was the 88 percent favorite as of Tuesday morning. Still, it remains to be seen whether that’s a temporary bump or a longer-term surge. [FiveThirtyEight]

89 percent
“Warcraft” has finished its theatrical run, pulling in $430 million worldwide. A ludicrous 89 percent of that came from overseas. The film might not break even, but a sequel may be in the cards anyway. [Gamespot]

Estimated number of loose dogs in the southern part of Dallas, according to a report from consultants, which has put a city on edge, forced pedestrians to carry around sticks to scare off the feral hounds, and just sort of gives off a vibe of post-apocalyptic terror is what we’re hearing.
