You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. Walt Hickey is traveling for an adult kickball tournament, so Kyle Wagner is filling in today.

Six of 58
According to Sen. Martin Heinrich, who has sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump pleading for continuity of leadership at the Pentagon and National Nuclear Security Administration, Trump has requested that just six of 58 appointed officials at the Pentagon stay in their positions until they can be replaced. The incoming administration has so far preferred to purge President Obama’s appointees as quickly as possible. [Gizmodo]

“an additional dozen or so”
Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page is attended to by a “handful” of company employees; a “dozen or so” others who are responsible for keeping spam, harassment and rude memes off of his page; and a fleet of professional photographers to snap the photos. The result is about as anodyne as you might expect from a few dozen Silicon Valley employees reverse-engineering authentic human interaction: This actually is my first rodeo, reads one post just above a set of photos of Zuckerberg looking a lot like a glad-handing gubernatorial candidate. But the real reason to swing by the Zuckerberg profile is to gape at the collection of comments and commenters that populate a tech CEO’s troll-proofed Facebook profile — it’s a perplexing species of celebrity social media account interaction. [Bloomberg]

48 percent
The prices commanded by marijuana on wholesale markets have fallen as legalization and decriminalization have spread. New investors are helping to cut production costs, leading to steep drops, such as a 48 percent drop in Colorado (now down to $1,300 per pound) since legal marijuana sales began in January 2014. [Bloomberg]

53.8 percent
Barry Bonds, the greatest baseball player of all time, received a vote on 238 Hall of Fame ballots this year, or 53.8 percent of all ballots submitted, leaving him short of the 75 percent share needed to be inducted. Roger Clemens received 239 votes. Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and Pudge Rodriguez each surpassed the 75 percent threshold. Vlad Guerrero, a cool superstar who drank from puddles as a child because he didn’t have access to running water, received 317 votes, good for 71.7 percent, and most baseball people seem to think he will get in next year. Can it, Trevor Hoffman. [ESPN]

266
Hickey went around and counted the “for your consideration” ads running in the major entertainment rags ahead of Oscars voting season and then converted the ad space into square inches for easy comparison. “Manchester by the Sea” was advertised in 5,155 square inches, second only to “Loving,” which was in 5,156. “Kubo and the Two Strings,” the most broadly advertised animated film of the season, appeared in 2,540 square inches. And a good deal further down the list were two films with 266 square inches apiece: “Moonlight,” which won the Golden Globe for best picture, drama, and “Kung Fu Panda 3,” which features voice acting from Jack Black.

3 years
It’s been almost three years since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, and after a laborious search of more than 46,000 square miles of sea, the search for the remains of the aircraft has been called off. [The New York Times]

7 years
President Obama on Tuesday commuted most of the 35-year prison sentence of former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who has been incarcerated for almost seven years. She will be released in four months. Manning — who has tried to take her own life twice in the past year — leaked documents from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and roughly 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. [The New York Times]

18 percent
Percentage of Philadelphia households that reported evidence of rodents, the largest percentage among the 25 U.S. cities broken out in data from the latest federal American Housing Survey. When it came to vermin of the cockroach variety, New Orleans, Houston and Miami topped the list of infested cities. [Bloomberg]

45 percent
Percentage of people who think the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is a good idea. As the GOP-controlled Congress plans its repeal, the legislation has never been more popular, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Among respondents, 45 percent said it’s a good idea, and 41 percent said it’s a bad idea. [Mark Murray, NBC News]

1,000 questions
Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee sent secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson almost 1,000 questions that must be answered before a vote on his nomination. That’s a lot more than is typical. [Slate]

$15,000
Possible value of stock in Zimmer Biomet, a medical device maker, bought by Tom Price just before the representative introduced a bill that would directly benefit the company. Price, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, says he didn’t know about the transaction. Price’s Senate confirmation hearings start today. [CNN]

4 teams
The NFL’s divisional playoff games are in the books, including the Green Bay Packers defeating the Universally Reviled Dallas Cowboys in the best game of the playoffs so far, (Congrats, Blythe.) And we’ve got our conference championship week probabilities all figured out. The New England Patriots have a 70 percent chance of beating the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Atlanta Falcons are 61-percent favorites against the Packers. The favorites to win the Super Bowl, in order: Patriots (43 percent), Falcons (25 percent), Packers (16 percent) and Steelers (15 percent). [FiveThirtyEight]

6 percent
After several years of rising revenue, a launch accident in June 2015 helped push Elon Musk’s SpaceX into the red in the last fiscal year. The company is reportedly fine, and space is hard, but a 6 percent drop in revenue doesn’t feel good. [The Wall Street Journal]

45 minutes
The federal government and Amtrak could cut the travel time between New York and Boston by 45 minutes, down to two hours and 45 minutes. While high speed rail is common in many developed nations, the plan — which would add tracks and trains in some small towns in Rhode Island and Connecticut — isn’t sitting well with some residents living along the route. [The Wall Street Journal]

146 years
After 146 years of operation, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will hold its final circus later this year. It turns out that “check out these animals doing awesome tricks” was made a bit superfluous as a live roadshow once we had ubiquitous cameras, the means to spread video far and wide and a rudimentary understanding of the capacity of mammals to experience pain. [The Atlantic]

3,391 guns
You cannot bring guns onto an airplane in a carry-on bag. That line in the airborne social contract was apparently news to the flyers responsible for the 3,391 guns confiscated by the Transportation Security Administration in 2016. That’s a record and up 30 percent from 2015. Eighty-three percent of them were loaded. [USA Today]

$26 million
Oscar contender “Hidden Figures” won the holiday weekend box office. “Sing” and “La La Land” continued to roll on. But it’s the wide releases where the numbers are rough; three high-profile studio films tanked: Ben Affleck’s “Live By Night,” Martin Scorsese’s “Silence” and “Monster Trucks.” [The Hollywood Reporter]

8 percent
Share of the time in the 2016 fiscal year that the New York Police Department made an arrest in a hit-and-run crash where someone was injured. In fatal hit-and-runs, the police made an arrest just one-third of the time. [WNYC]

11
Approximate number of web searches in Los Angeles for the Chargers (then of San Diego) for each search of the Rams (then of St. Louis) from 2011 through early 2016. The Rams moved to Los Angeles last year, and the Chargers this week announced they will do the same. [FiveThirtyEight]

85 percent
Probability the New England Patriots win against the Houston Texans this weekend, based on FiveThirtyEight’s NFL model. This weekend’s closest game appears to be Green Bay at Dallas on Sunday afternoon, with the hometown and also evil Cowboys having a 57 percent chance to win the game. [FiveThirtyEight]

$125
Fee to apply to have a parade in Whitefish, Montana. This is germane to the national conversation because a bunch of literal Nazis wanted to have a march there, but their application was incomplete and the money order they sent was $60 short of the required fee. The white supremacists and neo-Nazis now hope hold their march sometime in February. [The Flathead Beacon]

$49,000
Average tax cut to households earning more than $1 million per year should the Affordable Care Act be repealed, according to an analysis by the liberal Center on Budget and Police Priorities. [CNBC]

$12 billion
Whenever President-elect Donald Trump tweets about Mexico, the peso jumps around on international currency markets. Mexico is spending considerable reserves to defend the currency, but peso traders have come up with a cheaper solution: Just buy Twitter for $12 billion and then shut it down. It’s the monetary policy version of catching the Snitch. [Bloomberg]

4.1 percent
Percentage of American adults who identify as LGBT, an estimated 10,052,000 people. That’s an increase from 2012, which, as a reminder, was also the year after the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the military was lifted, the year when being transgender was declassified as a mental illness, and three years before same-sex marriage was recognized nationwide. [Gallup]

51-48
In the early hours of Thursday morning, the Senate voted 51-48 on a budget measure that will make it easier to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don’t yet have a framework for what could replace Obamacare, but thanks to the passage of the measure it will take a simple majority to overturn the law. [The Associated Press]

55 years
The San Diego Chargers plan to announce they will move to Los Angeles, a city where NFL viewership literally dropped after the St. Louis Rams moved there last year. Listen, after watching “La La Land,” I totally get the urge to move to sunny Los Angeles and get away from this miserable city. But that happy disposition wears off in an hour, maybe two, and it’s no reason to move our football team after 55 years in San Diego. [ESPN]

$204,000
Municipal billing records indicate cities have invoiced the Trump campaign for at least $204,000 in unpaid bills for police protection provided over the course of the campaign. The Clinton campaign owes at least $25,000. [The Center for Public Integrity]

$425 million
Trello Inc., which makes collaborative productivity software to help with project management, was acquired by Atlassian Corp. for $425 million. [The Wall Street Journal]

$2 billion
In a news conference Wednesday, Donald Trump said he would turn over control of his businesses to his sons but not sell them. He also said that just this past weekend, he had turned down a $2 billion development deal in Dubai. Trump said his company won’t make any new foreign deals while he is president but could still entertain domestic offers if they pass a vetting process. [Reuters]

103 miniature swarming drones
The U.S. military launched swarms of 103 miniature drones from several F/A-18s in an exercise. The likeliest use of the swarms — which can sneak through air defense systems like the noble warrior pigeon of old — will be surveillance. [BBC]

800
At least 800 of the 2,500 students at St. Charles East High School in Illinois did not show up Monday due to what is believed to be a norovirus outbreak. The school was closed on Tuesday for a deep bleach. [ABC News]

$20 million
Vegas was burned by the huge Clemson comeback in Monday’s college football championship game. Gamblers bet close to $20 million on the game in Nevada, and based on reports from several sports books, most of their money was on the underdog Clemson Tigers. It turns out people love betting against Alabama, and for once it actually worked. [CBS Sports]

521 million British pounds
The international soccer body FIFA announced it will expand the number of teams in the 2026 World Cup from 32 to 48. So, why not make the digit “48”? Well, this is significant digits, and the main thing you should take away from the expansion is that FIFA research found a 48-team tournament would increase revenue to 5.29 billion British pounds (about $6.5 billion). That would boost projected profits for the not-for-profit group by 521 million pounds. [BBC]

$1.5 billion
George Lucas will build the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles — not Chicago or San Francisco, which had previously been candidates to host to the Star Wars creator’s $1.5 billion eclectic collection of stuff. Thus comes to an end a long and dismal saga, at least until someone tries to reboot it over some perceived slight. [Bloomberg]

24.9 billion yen
Japan has a program where citizens can earmark a portion of their taxes to go to their hometowns. It’s a way for people who move to the big city to support the more rural areas whence they came. Technically, though, it’s a way for city dwellers to support a hometown, not necessarily theirs. Once the boonies picked up on this, they started offering booze or beef or other gifts and incentives to people who designate them as their “hometown.” This has been a boon for some areas — Hokkaido got 12.8 billion yen out of the program in 2015 — but it means that cities like Tokyo miss out on tax revenue, to the tune of a 24.9 billion yen loss for the metropolis in 2015.

6 resignations
Yahoo!, the vestigial organ of the U.S. technology scene, will see six board members — including chief executive Marissa Mayer — resign following its acquisition by Verizon. Side note: If you’re one of our Significant Digits subscribers — and if you’re not, sign up now! — and you’re receiving this on a Yahoo mail account, you may want to change that soon. [Venturebeat]

11.3 percent increase
Estimated increase in big-city murders in 2016, according to an analysis of preliminary data by FiveThirtyEight contributor and crime analyst Jeff Asher. The same cohort of cities saw a 14.8 percent rise in murders between 2014 and 2015. Still, murders are down compared to the 1980s and 1990s. [FiveThirtyEight]

35-31
In an upset, Clemson beat favorite Alabama to win the College Football Championship game last night. Alabama led for most of the game, but after a ridiculous series of events, Clemson won with a literal last-second touchdown. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

$100,000
The E-Sports Entertainment Association, which organizes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive matches and tournaments, said hackers released the personal details of many of its users after the company refused to pay a $100,000 ransom. The hack appears to have included names, email addresses, birth dates and other information for some 1,503,707 user accounts. [ESPN]

-$1.9 million
A new study from the Vera Institute of Justice found that in 2015, New Orleans spent $6.4 million jailing people because they could not pay bills imposed by the city’s criminal justice system. Meanwhile, New Orleans collected $4.5 million from criminal defendants in the form of bail, fines and fees. In other words, the city managed to find a way to lose money collecting bail. [FiveThirtyEight]

$53.2 million
Between 2003 and 2005, the oil and gas company Infineum reported $53.2 million in sales to Iran. During that time, Exxon Mobil had a 50 percent stake in Infineum. Also during that time, the U.S. had sanctions on Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. Rex Tillerson, a top Exxon executive at the time of the deal and later its CEO, is now President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the State Department. [USA Today]

7 wins
“La La Land” cleaned up at the Golden Globes, winning every award it was nominated for, including best director, best comedy or musical, and both of the lead acting prizes in its class. Based on the odds set by bookmakers, it’s the favorite to win best picture, with “Moonlight” stock on the rise after last night as well. [BBC]

8.0 percent
Share of homes in the Los Angeles television market that watched Fox’s NFL telecasts this year, down from 8.3 percent in 2015. Generally speaking, when you strip another city of its long-held franchise and send it off to sunny California at considerable expense to the franchise and stakeholders, you want to see that particular number go up. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

8 percent
The NFL Wildcard weekend is over with New York, Oakland, Miami and Detroit losing to Green Bay, Houston, Pittsburgh and Seattle, respectively. The winners go on to face organizations coming off of a first-round bye, with Seattle and Green Bay having the best shots of the group of winning the Super Bowl, an 8 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

41 percent
Theranos Inc. plans to fire about 41 percent of its workforce. The move comes after the blood-testing startup has been sued by business partners, targeted by regulators and forced to pull its original product line from the market. [Bloomberg]

26,171 bombs
Estimated number of bombs the United States dropped in seven countries during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, according to analysis of military data by researchers at the Council on Foreign Relations. They say the true number is almost certainly higher. [Council on Foreign Relations]

$2.1 billion
McDonald’s will sell an 80 percent stake in its Chinese business to a state-owned investment group and a U.S. private equity firm for $2.1 billion. The burger chain now owns and operates about 65 percent of its Chinese locations, but it has been trying to franchise more of its international restaurants. [BBC]

23 percent
The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, crashed as much as 23 percent Thursday, from about $1,153 per bitcoin to $887 per bitcoin, just as it was within spitting distance of its all-time high, $1,165.89 per bitcoin. [CNBC]

2,361 books
Chuck Finley, a fake person made up by several librarians, checked out 2,361 books at East Lake County Library in Florida over nine months of 2016. It’s crazy — Finley seemed to take an interest in books just as their time-on-shelf-without-being-checked-out expiration date was about to arrive. [The Orlando Sentinel]

92 million
Number of subscriptions to music streaming services across the industry, a jump of about 50 percent in 2016. [Bloomberg]

$900 million
In an attempt to stay afloat, Sears is selling its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $900 million. Sears bought the brand in 1927 for $500. [The Wall Street Journal]

$2,237,633,000
A woman is suing Chipotle for more than $2 billion, saying the company used her photo in promotional materials without permission, because presumably her attorney couldn’t stomach pursuing a dime more than eleventy bazillion dollarinos. [Grub Street]

$8 billion
Charles F. Feeney, who made a fortune from duty-free stores and prudent investments in technology companies, last year successfully completed his goal of giving away $8 billion. Over years of giving, he aggressively avoided the spotlight and asked recipients not to publicize the donations. Feeney has kept about $2 million — with an “m,” not a “b” — to continue his modest retirement. What a nice dude. [The New York Times]
