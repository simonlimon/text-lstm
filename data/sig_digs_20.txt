1.25 percent
A bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers has introduced the most Colorado legislation possible: the Keeping Our Manufacturers from Being Unfairly Taxed while Championing Health Act, or KOMBUCHA for short. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Scott Tipton (R-Colo.) are responsible for this hippie nonsense making its way into Congress. Kombucha, a kind of fermented tea, is naturally slightly alcoholic — its alcohol by volume sometimes reaches 1 percent. Unfortunately, that’s above the 0.5 percent it takes to be taxed as booze. This bill raises the threshold of 1.25 percent alcohol. [Rep. Jared Polis]

31 percent
Dentists are responsible prescribing about 8 percent of opioids given to patients in the U.S., and 31 percent of the pills for Americans aged 10 to 19. [STAT News]

50 percent
When people claim to be Christian and commit violence in the name of Christianity, according to a recent poll, 75 percent Americans say that person wasn’t really Christian. But when people claim to be Muslim and commit violence in the name of Islam, 50 percent of Americans said that person isn’t really Muslim. [Public Religion Research Institute]

Share of the time that a new algorithm from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was able to correctly identify an individual dolphin based on its calls alone. [Hakai Magazine]

$25 million
Daniel Lubetzky, the chief executive of the company that makes KIND bars, is contributing $25 million over the next decade to fund a group working to counteract the influence that huge food producers have on government nutrition policy. Lubetzky got interested in the issue when he learned that the government won’t let companies label foods like tree nuts and salmon as “healthy.” [The Washington Post]

1 cockroach
Zoo Atlanta has named one of their newest baby animals after quarterback Tom Brady, the result of a lost Super Bowl bet with the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island (deep in New England Patriots territory). The animal that the zoo selected is a Madagascar hissing cockroach. Just so I don’t get a bunch of emails from New Englanders again, you can have, “I suppose none of their GOATs were pregnant” for free to use in your everyday life as a riposte. [Click 2 Houston]

3.5
Scientists have long thought that female sea turtles lay an average of about 3.5 clutches of eggs per year. Now new research suggests the true number may be twice as high. Scientists count clutches (or, technically, tracks leading to clutches) to estimate the turtle population, so the news, if confirmed, could mean there are half as many of the endangered reptiles as previously believed. [The Atlantic]

25 years
Pedro Hernandez faces up to 25 years in prison after being convicted of the 1979 murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. [The New York Times]

51 pages
In a 51-page decision, three judges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board have ruled that the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT owns the lucrative patents for gene editing technology CRISPR-Cas9. The University of California had challenged the patent, arguing that Broad’s technology was essentially a logical extension of UC scientists’ work. As far as academic fights go, this is Ali-Frazier and worth a read. [STAT News]

$8,898
The eye-popping price of Intel’s new Xeon processor, the E7-8894 v4, which is really only for the industrial-server-owning set. The processor has a maximum clock speed of 3.4 GHz. [The Verge]

After a series of colossal screw-ups involving massive data breaches, Yahoo! is near an agreement to agree to reduce its sale price to Verizon. About $300 million will likely be chopped off what was originally a $4.8 billion deal, according to reports. [The Wall Street Journal]

Annual rate of gross domestic product growth in Iceland. The nation is a bit notorious for boom/bust-style growth and is bracing itself for a hard landing. [Bloomberg]

20 percent
Share of Americans ages 25 to 35 who moved over the past year. That’s a lot lower than previous generations: In 2000 26 percent of the cohort had moved recently. In 1990, it was 27 percent. I would try to find the time to figure out why, but I’ll have to consult my student loan company about whether I can afford to do so. [Bloomberg]

20-L
That was the runway pilot and actor Harrison Ford was supposed to land on at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. Instead he landed on the taxiway and flew just over American Airways flight 1456. Just a note, if you ever have to ask, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” someone screwed up. [NBC News]

26 years
For the past 26 years, White Castle has sustained an absurd Valentine’s Day tradition at several locations where the fast-food burger joint becomes, for one night only, a fine dining establishment. [Eater]

A federal judge refused to throw out the U.S. government’s $100 million lawsuit against Lance Armstrong, meaning that the former cyclist will be going to court. Armstrong is being sued under the False Claims Act over his use of performance-enhancing drugs, which the government claims violated his contract with the Postal Service. [Sports Illustrated]

1 year
After a failed one-year experiment, nudity is returning to Playboy magazine as of the March 2017 issue. Despite repeated pleas, no, Significant Digits is done with the pornography business and this feature will never revert to the sordid imagery my predecessors relied on to sell newsletters. [USA Today]

24 days
After serving in the role for 24 whole days, former general Michael Flynn has stepped down as President Trump’s national security adviser. He resigned after his position became untenable following revelations he had misled members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his discussions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. late last year.

48 percent
A new poll found that the three left-of-center German political parties would win a combined 48 percent of the vote in forthcoming parliamentary elections. That would be enough to win the contest, build a government and oust Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats from power. [Reuters]

288.93 boxes
Citrus greening disease is making for more watery oranges, which means producers of orange juice need to crush more oranges to make the same amount of O.J. concentrate. It used to be that producers needed about 250 boxes of oranges to make one ton of concentrated juice. In the Brazilian orange season that began in July, watery oranges meant it took 288.93 boxes to produce one ton of juice. [Bloomberg]

30,000 British pounds
How much Queen Elizabeth II is willing to pay to have someone handle her social media game. (30,000 pounds is about $37,500 at current exchange rates.) A one-year position is open for anyone who thinks they’re up to the job. [Mental Floss]

2 million British pounds
The thieves behind an elaborate heist of 2 million pounds worth of antique books — including tomes by Copernicus, Galileo, E.L. James, Newton, da Vinci and Dante (I was joking about that third one) — may run into issues fencing the haul. Good luck rolling into the shop with a 1566 copy of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium and attempting to claim it isn’t hot. [The Guardian]

117 retailers
The future has been realized in Oregon as 117 retailers were allowed to begin home delivery of marijuana under permits granted by the state’s Liquor Control Commission last year. That’s right: Somewhere in America, you can now order legal marijuana and have it delivered. [KGW8 News]

100,000 people
More than 100,000 people in Northern California were told to evacuate their homes Sunday after authorities became concerned that an emergency spillway at the nation’s tallest dam was on the verge of failure. Water began flowing over the spillway at the Oroville Dam for the first time in its nearly 50-year history on Saturday, threatening to flood downstream towns. On Sunday night, authorities said the lake level had dropped, reducing the risk. [The Associated Press, The Los Angeles Times]

4.3 million
Average viewership of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s daily press briefings, more than daytime soap operas “General Hospital” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Viewers are apparently drawn to the briefings — audiences on cable’s Fox News, MSNBC and CNN rise 10 percent when Spicer is on — and can you blame them? You never know what’s going to happen next. [The New York Times]

$55.6 million
“The Lego Batman Movie” won the weekend at the box office, pulling in $55.6 million. That means the erotic thriller “Fifty Shades Darker” was forced to submit, and presumably liked it. [The Numbers]

3 judges
Three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to overturn a ruling by a federal district judge halting several parts of President Trump’s “immigration ban.” Trump’s executive order temporarily blocked all refugees from entering the U.S., as well as any immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. The case is likely heading for the Supreme Court. [FiveThirtyEight]

63 points
The BAFTA awards are on Sunday night, and they’re one of the final good indicators we have left of how the Oscar race is going. Keep an eye on who wins best actor and best actress. Historically, whoever wins those awards at the BAFTAs has tended to win them at the Oscars. If Casey Affleck takes home the BAFTA, he’ll go into the Academy Awards as the favorite for best actor. Same with Natalie Portman or frontrunner Emma Stone in best actress. A BAFTA win is worth 63 points in our Oscars tracker. [FiveThirtyEight]

0.365%
Percentage of Stack Overflow questions about the programming language Haskell during the weekend, compared to 0.21 percent during weekdays. In other words, people tend to mess around with Haskell on weekend projects rather than in their 9-to-5 jobs. At the other end of the spectrum is Sharepoint, a Microsoft Office product, which is asked about more frequently from Monday to Friday. [Stack Overflow]

52 votes
In a 52-47 vote, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeff Sessions on Wednesday night as President Trump’s attorney general. Every Republican senator voted “yes” — save for Sessions himself, who voted “present.” And every Democrat voted “no” — save for Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who voted “yes.” [The New York Times]

91.7 pounds per person
Americans love chicken. This year, each American is projected to eat around 91.7 pounds of chicken, on average. That’s up 9 percent since 2010. But making all that chicken happen is an elaborate and — according to a lawsuit — unfair process. The chicken industry is dominated by a few giant poultry processors that buy birds from smaller farmers. And five former chicken farmers in five states have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the big processors of “treating farmers who raise the chickens like indentured servants and colluding to fix prices paid to them.” [The Associated Press]

878° F
It would be really nice if we had lots of pictures of the surface of Venus. You know, like we do with the surface of Mars. Here’s the issue though: Venus is an unfathomable hellhole. It’s 878° F and the atmospheric pressure is incredible. Add in the boiling sulphuric rain and you get a habitat that not even our most robust robots can handle for long. The record for “time spent on Venus without being rendered inoperable by Venus” by a manmade object is 127 minutes. But have faith, we’re starting to invent and build the tech that can tolerate that ecosystem. [Ars Technica]

211,487 homicides

$3.75
Many cities and states have raised their minimum wages in recent years, but many of those laws leave at least one group out: tipped workers, such as waiters. Among the states, the gap is most pronounced in Massachusetts, where minimum wage earners make $11 per hour while tipped workers make $3.75 an hour. [FiveThirtyEight]

17 miles
A crack in Antarctica’s fourth-largest ice shelf, named Larcen C, grew by 17 miles in the past two months. It’s now over 100 miles long and just 20 miles away from reaching the end of the shelf. When that happens, we’ll get a staggeringly huge iceberg, and “Larsen C will be at its smallest size ever recorded.” [The New York Times]

51-50
Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of eduction. Two Republicans, and every Democrat, voted against her. The 50 “no” votes DeVos received are more than any education secretary since the position was established in 1979. [FiveThirtyEight]

Over the past 25 years, the winner of the top award at the Directors Guild of America Awards went on to win best picture at the Oscars 19 times. That’s a good sign for “La La Land,” as director Damien Chazelle pulled in the DGA prize for best feature-film directing on Saturday. [FiveThirtyEight]

Tesla and SpaceX eventually joined 97 other major technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and many others, in signing an amicus brief opposing President Trump’s executive order temporarily blocking all refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. [Business Insider]

$500,000
The jersey Tom Brady wore during his Super Bowl win on Sunday has gone missing, and the Texas Rangers have been called in to investigate (along with the Houston police). The shirt could be worth $300,000 as memorabilia — maybe even $500,000 — according to an estimate in the New York Post, but only so long as it’s found soon and authenticated. [The New York Post]

11 million TVs
Number of internet-connected televisions sold by Vizio since 2010. Apparently, Vizio has been hawking TVs that “automatically tracked what consumers were watching and transmitted that data back to its servers.” This led to an Federal Trade Commission crackdown, a mandated data deletion and penalties totaling some $3.7 million.

Sunday’s Super Bowl overtime meant an estimated $20 million more in ad revenue for Fox, as the network got to air an additional four spots. [Adweek]

117.7 million viewers
Peak viewership of Super Bowl LI, just as the game was going into overtime. That’s slightly higher than another good moment in the broadcast, Lady Gaga’s halftime show, which pulled in 117.5 million. Overall, the game drew its smallest audience in four years — 111.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. [Reuters]

34-28
Preparation, skill and mental toughness all came together last night in an absolute stunner: I successfully made armadillo eggs for my Southwest-infused Super Bowl party, and they had just the right amount of kick without being too overpowering. Oh, also, the New England Patriots won. It was a nutty game. At one point the Pats were down 28-3 against the Atlanta Falcons. And for the first time in Super Bowl history, the game went into overtime. Not my first choice of outcomes, sure, but easily one of the most entertaining NFL games I’ve seen. Also, the key is a little MSG in the spice rub, which adds a savory element to the armadillo egg. [FiveThirtyEight]

25 points
It was really one for the record books: No team has come back from a Super Bowl deficit of more than 10 points, and Tom Brady proved — to my chagrin — that he’s the best quarterback ever. He had more completions, pass attempts and passing yards in a Super Bowl than anyone else, ever. His team ran the most-ever offensive plays in the championship. The Pats put together the biggest comeback — 25 points! — in a Super Bowl ever. It’s the most ridiculous achievement — ever. [ESPN]

2 options
In other news, Puerto Rico will hold a non-binding referendum on June 11 on whether to (a) go for statehood, or (b) pursue independence or free association. If option “a” wins, they’ll pursue statehood. If option “b” wins, Puerto Ricans will vote in October on a second referendum to choose between independence and free association. Also, we’ll get to call it the “Puerto Rexit,” so keep an eye on how this vote goes. [Associated Press]

5 moves
Hou Yifan, the top-ranked female chess player in the world, threw a game at the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival to protest the “‘unbelievable and weird pairings’ that meant seven of her 10 opponents during the event were women.” Hou, a.k.a. the “Queen of Chess,” who recently left the women’s circuit to compete in mixed events, lost the game in just five moves. [NPR]

Nordstrom Inc. has dropped Ivanka Trump’s brand for this season. The department-store chain said the move was due to poor sales — Nordstrom carries a ton of brands and each year cuts the worst-performing 10 percent. Nieman Marcus also appears to have dropped the brand. It’s possible boycotts of Trump family brands are having an effect. [Bloomberg, Racked]

65 years
Queen Elizabeth II is celebrating 65 years on the British throne today. They say it’s her “Sapphire Jubilee,” but I recommend you don’t call it that because it sounds like a “My Little Pony” character or a Pokemon edition and you’ll sound absolutely ridiculous. She’s the Queen; show some respect. [Business Insider]
