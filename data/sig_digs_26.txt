1 guilty verdict
The alleged ringleader behind an $18.7 million maple syrup heist in Quebec was found guilty of “theft, fraud and trafficking stolen goods” on Saturday. Twenty-six people were originally arrested in connection with the robbery. [CBC]

41 shipwrecks
Forty-one shipwrecks, all amazingly well-preserved, were found in the Black Sea. The vessels, dating from the 9th century through the 19th century, are an incredible find (for everyone except all the people who definitely died to make them possible, that is). [National Geographic]

56 years
Jackie Chan is a legend, but the films he usually makes — comedies and martial arts movies — don’t tend to win Best Picture awards at the Oscars. Still, Chan, after 56 years working in the film industry, was recognized on Saturday at the annual Governors Awards with an honorary Academy Award. [Reuters]

69 legislative chambers
With the 2016 elections in the books, the Republican Party is set to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017. And — with at least 33 governors — the party will have complete control of state government in at least 25 states. [The Washington Post]

Assembly bill 1687
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is suing California over Assembly bill 1687, a law that forces the site to remove the ages of actors should they request it. While the law was intended to reduce age discrimination, IMDb argues it’s unconstitutional, and that it’s an ineffective approach to fight ageism. [The Guardian]

2,281,155 votes
Despite gains by Republicans across the map, one incumbent GOP governor — Pat McCrory in North Carolina, who signed a law limiting the bathroom access of transgender people — may have lost his race, though it is very close. Democrat Roy Cooper has claimed victory, with 2,281,155 votes to McCrory’s 2,276,383. [The New York Times]

2 Seahawks game tickets
Cassius Marsh is a linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks and is in the middle of a nightmare: the player’s a longtime fan of the “Magic: The Gathering” card game, and somebody stole his collection of cards, which are worth $20,000 to $25,000. He’s offering two Seahawks game tickets to anyone who finds them. [The Washington Post]

5.1 points
This year the Senate races tracked remarkably well with the presidential race in a number of states, showing that Senate elections had been thoroughly nationalized. The average absolute difference between a Senate race and presidential race in 11 states to watch was a mere 5.1 percentage points, strongly influenced by Ohio and Missouri where the races did not track closely. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 percent
Smith & Wesson, which announced earlier this week that it will change its name to the highly generic American Outdoor Brands, has seen its stock tank on the news of Donald Trump’s presidency. A Donald Trump presidency means gun-owners will not perceive an immediate threat to the availability of guns, which means no fear-buoyed impulse purchases of American Outdoor Brands firearms, which in turn means a 20 percent crash in the value of the company. [Bloomberg]

63 minutes
The National Football League is considering dialing back the number of advertisements played during a game, which can be as high as 70 per game. On average, 63 minutes of an NFL telecast is ads, and the NFL is trying to stop the bleeding in its viewership numbers. [Awful Announcing]

600 hours of content
An estimate from CordCutting.com says the average Netflix subscriber watched around 600 hours of Netflix content in 2016, which is just about double the watch time for subscribers in 2011. [Business Insider]

700
Number of proposed constitutional amendments in Congress over the past 200 years that sought to change the Electoral College. None of them passed. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 terms
Sheriff Joe Arpaio has lost his job as the sheriff of Maricopa County after six terms on the job. He’ll be in court in December to face criminal charges for ignoring orders to prevent his staff from racial profiling. [Los Angeles Times]

350
Number of pieces from David Bowie’s art collection up for auction today. [Digg]

62 percent
We will be figuring out the many reasons Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency for quite some time, but it’s already clear there are some demographic groups she didn’t court. According to exit polls, she lost white women without a college degree 62 percent to 34 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

79 percent
Percentage of D.C. residents who voted in favor of a ballot measure that would support making the District a state, with a small federally-administered district in the middle housing congress and the White House. A petition will now go to Congress. [NPR]

2,000
General Motors announced it will cut shifts and lay off 2,000 workers in Ohio and Michigan in the first quarter of next year. [MarketWatch]

59.7 million
After more than a day of counting, it appears that Hillary Clinton will win the national popular vote. With some votes still coming in, she has around 59.9 million votes to Donald Trump’s 59.7 million as of right now. [New York Times]

45
Last night Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Read how it all went down at the FiveThirtyEight live blog. [FiveThirtyEight]

279
While the outcomes in Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire and Arizona are still being determined, Trump secured at least 279 electoral votes — smashing through Hillary Clinton’s blue wall in the midwest by taking Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as winning Florida, North Carolina and Ohio — to win his long-shot bid for the presidency. [ABC News]

9 percent
This election saw the two lead candidates fail to resonate with many young voters. Based on the CNN exit poll, 9 percent of voters ages 18-29 went for third parties. [FiveThirtyEight]

51 seats
While the New Hampshire Senate race hasn’t yet been called and Louisiana is headed for a run-off, that’s the minimum number of U.S. Senate seats the Republican party will control after last night. Senators Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin will hold their seats. [ABC News]

5 to 9 seats
Democrats are projected to gain anywhere from five to nine seats in the House of Representatives, but it’s nowhere near enough to put the GOP control of the chamber in jeopardy. [ABC News]

3 initiatives
In addition to “law and order” candidate Donald Trump, Americans craved marijuana last night as ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts and Nevada passed to legalize recreational marijuana. (We’re still waiting to hear the results of Maine’s bid to do the same.) Attempting to understand the grand motivations of this nation are futile. [The Washington Post]

Americans, go vote. And when you’re done voting, come to FiveThirtyEight for updates from our live blog all day and into the night. I’ll be representing FiveThirtyEight on ABC News’ election night live stream starting at 7 p.m. Eastern. 

5 to 20 seats
All 435 U.S. House of Representatives seats are up for election today, and the Democrats would need a 30-seat swing to gain the majority. That is very unlikely. The Cook Political Report considers 37 seats competitive, seven of which are in Democratic hands and 30 of which are GOP seats. Given the uncertainty in the polls this cycle, Cook estimates a swing of five to 20 seats to Democrats. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 polls
Of the 19 polls to come in that were conducted beginning on or after Oct. 28 (when FBI Director James Comey said he was reviewing more emails related to the case of Hillary Clinton’s email server), seven had Clinton up 4 points and an additional four had her up 3 points. Although it’s perfectly possible for polls to converge, it’s worth being skeptical because there’s some herding at this point in the cycle, since no pollster wants to get burned. [FiveThirtyEight]

13 percent
Probability that a white man without a college degree who lives in Alabama will support a Democrat, compared with a 92 percent chance that a nonwhite woman who lives in D.C. and doesn’t have a college degree will. [The Economist]

21
Heads up: It is legal to take a selfie with your ballot in 21 states, plus D.C. It is illegal in 16. Know the rules in your state. Most states also ban campaign paraphernalia such as shirts or signs. Also, my armed friends, it is explicitly illegal to take a gun into a polling place in six states. [Digg]

36 percent
Percentage of Hispanic voters who have cast early ballots in Florida who did not vote in 2012. [The New York Times]

42 ballot initiatives
When you’re voting today — seriously, go vote — spare a thought for the residents of San Francisco, who besides having to cast a ballot in races for president, senator and representative also must contend with a thorough phalanx of ballot initiatives. California is bad enough; there are 17 statewide ballot initiatives, including health care policy changes and whether to require people performing in pornographic films to wear condoms. But San Francisco slathers it on, with voters having to tackle 25 additional local ballot measures. If only there were another way, such as democratically delegating an individual to represent the interests of a given community in a body of such people who make informed choices on matters of state. [CityLab]

50.5 percent
Probability that Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Democrats need to pick up at least four seats to have a chance of controlling the body. Close races to watch include the contests in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Missouri, Nevada and Pennsylvania. [FiveThirtyEight]

71.6 percent
Probability that Clinton will win the presidency, according to our polls-only model. The model forecasts Clinton getting 48.5 percent of the national popular vote and Donald Trump getting 45 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

5,861,223 voters
That’s how many people voted in Florida in 2000, to some notoriety. This cycle, 6,424,595 people have already voted early in the Sunshine State, with 46,270,767 voting early nationally. [Joshua Chavers, The U.S. Elections Project]

3 states
The number of states — Missouri, New Hampshire, and Nevada — where the polling average says the gap between two Senate candidates is one percentage point or smaller. Control of the Senate comes down to whether or not Democrats can flip four or more seats; we give the Democrats 57 percent odds as of early Monday morning. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 percentage points
In Nevada, more registered Democrats have turned out for early voting than registered Republicans by a six percentage point margin. In 2012, 70 percent of Nevada voters did so early, so this sizable lead could mean that the Silver State is already decided for Hillary Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 percent
Percentage of respondents to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll who said the 2016 election made them more proud of America. But seriously what kind of question is that? Like, are the 62 percent who said it made them less proud just hamming it up for the telemarketer on the other end of the line, or do they walk around their lives just ever so diminished? Kudos to the 28 percent who said “no difference either way” for just being honest about it. [The Wall Street Journal]

48.4 percent
That’s the expected share of the popular vote that Hillary Clinton is forecasted to win, based on the latest from the FiveThirtyEight model. Donald Trump is projected to get 45.3 percent, but there are a solid range of possibilities, so it’s worth checking out the model every minute of every day until you feel certain of your place in the world. [FiveThirtyEight]

868 polling places
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights did a survey of 381 of the approximately 800 counties that once had to submit their voting-rule changes to the federal government due to their history of discrimination at the polls. (A 2013 Supreme Court ruling lifted that requirement.) It found that there were 868 fewer polling places in those counties than in 2012 or 2014. That can have the effect of long lines and reduced turnout. [The Nation]

565,000
According to a University of Florida professor’s analysis, that’s the number of Hispanic voters who had cast in-person early ballots in Florida as of Saturday, double the number in 2012. Factoring in absentee ballots, 911,000 Hispanic Floridians have already voted. [The Miami Herald]

0.5 percent
When you see a shift in the polls, it’s easy to ask, “What kind of person decides to just change their vote from him to her?” or vice-versa. Well, it’s actually a little more complicated than that. Comparing the changes in presidential voting intentions in a group of 1,227 people polled in January and then in October, it’s not so much that people hop from Clinton to Trump (as 0.5 percent did) or Trump to Clinton (as 1.5 percent did) but that people jumped from Trump to Neither or Clinton to Neither and back. On the whole, few people have changed their views on the race. [FiveThirtyEight]

41 percent
Percentage of Republicans who in a New York Times/CBS News poll said they believed Donald Trump’s candidacy was bad for the GOP. This is abnormal. [The New York Times]

500 earnings calls
NFL viewership is down and it’s tough to find a single reason why. The league blames interest in the presidential race, but Bloomberg highlighted that is a rather common corporate scapegoat for poor performance: In a 90-day stretch, over 500 earning calls for companies cited some variation of “the election” regarding why their financials were what they were. [Bloomberg]

711 jobs
The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the part of the FDA tasked with approving new drugs) has a huge problem with staff retention. When a pharmaceutical company backs up a dump truck full of money for one of their employees it’s difficult to keep them around. This led to a drastic number of vacancies; the CDER had 711 openings out of only 5,525 total positions by the end of September. [Kaiser Health News]

1947
Congratulations to the Arizona Cardinals, who after the Cubs’ historic victory in the world series now have the dubious honor of owning the longest championship drought in a major American sports league. The franchise — then the Chicago Cardinals — last won the NFL championship in 1947. No pressure. [Yahoo Sports]

49.9 million
Peak viewership of Game 7 of the World Series, right as the game headed into the ninth inning. On average the game was the most watched baseball telecast since 1991. [Reliable Sources]

8-7
It’s over. The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in extra innings in the World Series. The 108-year World Series drought is over. [FiveThirtyEight]

17 minutes
Length of a rain delay during Game 7 that occurred after the tied ninth inning in Cleveland, which I’m sure bars across America are calling “the time it just rained money.” [ABC 7 Chicago]

33.7 percent
Probability Donald Trump wins the election, according to the FiveThirtyEight model at around midnight last night. [FiveThirtyEight]

39 years old
David Ross, the veteran Cubs catcher, hit a home run in the game, the last of his career. He’s the oldest person ever to hit a homer in Game 7 of a World Series. [SportsCenter, UPROXX]

$31 million
Gawker LLC reached a $31 million settlement with Hulk Hogan, ending a legal process that had the potential to last very expensive years. A jury in Florida awarded Hogan $140 million, though the former gossip site had strong potential to win on appeals. The bulk of Gawker was sold to Univision. [Reuters]

$7 billion
Facebook revenue in the third quarter of the year, buoyed by a dynamic growth rate and strong mobile performance. The company is on track for $27 billion in revenue this year. [The Wall Street Journal]

3-3
The World Series will go to Game 7 following a massive Chicago Cubs win over the Cleveland Indians last night that tied up the series 3-3. Based on our MLB predictions, Cleveland is the slight favorite to win, but anything is possible. [FiveThirtyEight]

3 108-year-olds
The Chicago Tribune, the Northbrook Star and the Wall Street Journal have each run a splashy profile of a 108-year-old Chicago native, which would make them the same age as the Cubs title drought. A Bloomberg estimate that there should only be around 25 people aged 108 in Chicago presumably means 22 papers are sitting on glowing profiles we have yet to read. [Bloomberg]

4 nights
Weird idiosyncrasy of both Trump and Clinton in this campaign: They both really like sleeping in their own beds every night. At considerable expense, each flies back from the campaign almost every night to crash at their own house. Trump stayed at a property he owned all but four of the nights in October. [POLITICO]

32 percent
FiveThirtyEight has premiered its college football predictions, and 8-0 Alabama is a 32 percent chance to win the national title. Other teams in the hunt include Clemson, Michigan and Washington. [FiveThirtyEight]

60 to 70
Last year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the folks behind the Oscars — recognized that their current membership did not reflect the nation or the industry as a whole, and sought to include more diverse members while also considering removing the voting rights of older members who has been inactive in the industry. The end result of that last drive? They’re stripping the voting rights from only 60 to 70 people, which the Academy says is “under 1 percent” of its members. At some point it goes from a necessary corrective to a cruel thing to do to a bunch of old folks, you know? [The Los Angeles Times]

$69 million
There’s an incredible political scandal going on in South Korea right now. The details are far too many to put in a significant digit – I recommend reading the full account — but the gist is that the president has been keeping company with a number of shady characters with vague affiliations to a cult and running major decisions and briefings past them. It involves a slush fund with an alleged $69 million in graft in it, corruption in higher education, a telltale selfie left on a tablet lousy with evidence, and an apoplectic South Korean populace.

We’re a week away from Election Day. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Enjoy the politics:

+4.7 points
Hillary Clinton’s national vote margin according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Clinton is performing worse than Barack Obama did in 2012 in 10 of 12 states, while her popular vote margin is on the whole generally better. This means that the chance of an electoral vote loss and a popular vote win are better for Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

32 percent
Percentage of voters in a new Morning Consult poll that said the new FBI review of Clinton emails would not have any effect on their coming vote, compared to 33 percent — most of them already against Clinton — who said it made them less likely to support her. [POLITICO]

50 theaters
AMC will open theaters in 25 cities around the country — one in each for Democrats and Republicans — to watch results come in on cable news. Or you could watch me and my colleagues on ABC Digital for free, wherever. Up to you! [The New York Times]

$766,756
Donald Trump’s campaign is disputing a charge with Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio over $766,756 in its latest filing. Good luck, Tony Fabrizio, good luck. [The New York Times]

1.5 million
Oh good god OK we are done with politics for the day. That is the number of Americans who don’t have sick leave and go to work while lousy with illness every week. Ever been to a restaurant? Consider getting on the “paid sick leave bus” next chance you get. It almost makes you wish I covered another political story rather than this bubonic crap, yeah? [The Upshot]

$600 million
Valuation of Giphy, a company that brings in no revenue but does provide instantaneous GIFs for those in need of one. The company wrapped up a $72 million fundraising round, and its GIFs — for those out of the know, the kind of file that results from a video and an image that love each other very much — are seen by over 100 million people every day.
