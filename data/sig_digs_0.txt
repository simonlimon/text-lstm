47 percent
In the first 11 days of the open enrollment period, Americans signed up for 1.5 million health plans on healthcare.gov. That’s a 47 percent increase over a similar period last year. Enrollment in Obamacare ends after 45 days, less time than last year by half. [Bloomberg]

24 years
The Vans Warped Tour will come to an end in 2018, with its 24th tour to be its last. The punk show is the last major traveling music festival still running. [Billboard]

61.6 percent
Australia’s national postal survey on same-sex marriage delivered a decisive 61.6 percent win in favor of marriage equality. The survey wasn’t tied to the enactment of any policy, but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that parliament must commit to achieve the social reform by Christmas. [The Guardian]

$450.3 million
“Salvator Mundi” by Leonardo da Vinci sold at Christie’s for $450.3 million. That beats the previous record for the most expensive piece of art sold at auction by a considerable amount, a Picasso that went for $179.4 million in 2015. The marketing campaign that Christie’s mounted was extraordinary by art standards. It’s the only known painting by da Vinci still in a private collection. [The New York Times]

$860 million
Bloomberg has slashed its estimate of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s net worth from $3 billion to a measly $860 million. A Forbes investigation found that Ross may have been overstating his fortune to the press for some time to compounding effect. I’m sending thoughts and prayers to Ross’s recently lost third comma.

3 former soccer officials
The first of many prosecutions of world soccer officials began in Brooklyn earlier this week, with the kick off of the racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering trials of José María Marín, Juan Ángel Napout and Manuel Burga. More than 40 others were also arrested in connection to allegations of corruption in international soccer, with 23 already pleading guilty. [The Guardian]

18 counts
The jurors in the bribery trial of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez deadlocked once again Tuesday on all 18 counts. The judge told them to continue deliberating. [The Associated Press]

1993
Illumination Entertainment, which makes movies like “Sing” and “Minions,” is reportedly close to a deal with Nintendo to adapt the Super Mario Bros. franchise into a film. Nintendo is currently on track for its best financial year since 2010. The last time that Mario hit screens was in 1993 with the “Super Mario Bros.” live action film, a movie so bad that one of the most popular franchises on Earth has not seen a movie theater since. [CNN]

4.62 billion acres
That’s the total amount of cropland on Earth, according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey. Interestingly, that’s about 15 to 20 percent more than earlier estimates, as some areas were previously mapped inaccurately or unmapped altogether. [Bloomberg]

$5.5 billion
How much Google spent on traffic acquisition costs in the third quarter of 2017. That’s about 23 percent of its ad revenue. Google has to pay to get its search engine front and center on browsers, mobile phones and other services. One example: Firefox just rolled out a browser update that makes Google, not Yahoo, its default search engine. Yahoo was previously paying more than $300 million per year for that; it’s unclear what Google’s tab is. [Bloomberg]

26 ancient cities
A team of archaeologists was able to analyze 12,000 clay tablets detailing business transactions mentioning 26 ancient cities. Here’s the even cooler part: 11 of those cities are lost. However, using the locations of the 15 known cities and the observed frequencies of transactions, the researchers were able to estimate the potential locations for the lost cities. Imagine future archaeologists taking bus schedules for New York, Cleveland and Atlanta and using math to find the ancient lost city of Philly. [The Washington Post]

75 percent
Kalashnikov Kontsern, the maker of the AK-47, is going private. The Russian state-owned holding company Rostec sold just under half of Kalashnikov in 2013, part to Aleksei Krivoruchko and part to two other investors. But now those two investors as well as Rostec are reportedly selling shares to Krivoruchko, giving him roughly three quarters of the company and taking it into private hands. Until the imposition of sanctions stemming from the crisis in Ukraine, Kalashnikov was selling more rifles to the U.S. civilian market than to the Russian military. [The New York Times]

30 million people
What once was warmly called “pre-hypertension” is now the imposing “stage 1 hypertension,” according to new guidelines. That means 103 million people technically have hypertension, including 30 million people who until this point thought they were good. [Bloomberg]

$58,000
Based on a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2019 households making $1 million per year or higher would on average enjoy a tax cut of $58,000 under the GOP tax plan. Households earning $50,000 to $75,000 would see an average tax cut of $688 in the same period. [Bloomberg]

$2.3 billion
That’s the value of a takeover bid from a private equity group for Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant business has seen a ton of consolidation lately, and Buffalo Wild Wings’ struggles with the rising price of chicken wings and declining foot traffic make it a compelling target. [The Wall Street Journal]

75 percent
The Department of Justice is distributing $772.5 million in recovered funds to Bernie Madoff’s victims and ultimately anticipates returning $4 billion to them. That, plus around $9 billion from the liquidation of his firm, means that when all is said and done, victims should get around 75 percent of their losses back. [Crain’s New York Business]

$319 per hour
That’s how much the contract of a small energy company from Montana was allowed to bill the Puerto Rican public power company per lineman per hour. That’s an exceptional rate — even for emergency work — about 17 times the average salary of a local lineman. The linemen themselves were making way less than that: $42 per hour plus overtime for some electrical workers, $63 per hour for a group of senior workers and up to $100 per hour for other workers on double time. [The New York Times]

$5 billion
That’s the approximate market value of Mattel, less than half of the $11 billion valuation of Hasbro. The two biggest U.S. toymakers may come together, as Hasbro has reportedly made a takeover offer. The toy business has taken a lot of hits lately, with the Chapter 11 filing of Toys “R” Us and the shift in consumer spending toward tech-based items. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.63 billion
Estimated losses in 2015 for untaxed cigarette sales in New York. The state has a $4.35 per pack tax and New York City has a further $1.50 per pack tax. The Tax Foundation estimates the city lost $740 million in 2015 and the state lost roughly $895 million due to black market sales, making the state the country’s cigarette smuggling capital.

2 Navy SEALS
Two members of SEAL Team Six are under investigation in the death of a staff sergeant in the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group stationed in Mali. Several members of the special operations community told The Daily Beast the staff sergeant — Logan Melgar — was found dead after discovering that the two SEALs had allegedly been pocketing money from a fund dedicated to paying local informants.

4.3 points
A study of 416 men and women who arrived in the E.R. with moderate to severe pain in their arms or legs found compelling evidence against the necessity of opioids in pain management. When patients rated their pain on an 11-point scale, the initial average pain was 8.7. After taking Tylenol and ibuprofin, it dropped 4.3 points. After taking Tylenol and oxycodone, it dropped 4.4 points. That’s not exactly the kind of results that encourage rolling the dice on opiates. [The New York Times]

5 women
Five women told the New York Times that comedian and director Louis C.K. engaged in sexual misconduct. The comedian has cancelled engagements and the premiere of his film “I Love You Daddy” on Thursday as the allegations came forward. [The New York Times]

21.7 percent
New York City voter turnout was a new low on Tuesday, down to 21.7 percent of the city’s 5 million registered voters. A competitive but not particularly close mayoral election in an off-Presidential year may have played a role here. [The New York Daily News]

30 interviews
Interviews with 30 people who knew Roy Moore between 1977 to 1982 indicate that during the time he was an assistant district attorney he pursued relationships with at least four young girls between the ages of 14 and 18. Moore, who is the Republican nominee for Alabama’s open senate seat, denied the allegations. [The Washington Post]

33 films
Hallmark will have premiered 33 new and original holiday films on its two channels by the end of the year, up from 28 new movies last year. The company cranked up its output back in 2008 and has now moved all-in on the holidays, with 136 total Christmas movies in their repertoire. [The Wall Street Journal]

120 percent
That would be the return on investment if you invested in a portfolio stuffed with “bubble” markets at the beginning of 2017. Turns out the prudent investor puts it all on Chinese real estate, cryptocurrencies, ETF, long term bonds, volatility bets, Tesla and Netflix, and Tencent Holdings. Who would have guessed?

4 countries
A Facebook pilot program described by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner probably sounded far better on paper. Available in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia, Facebook’s intention is to cut back on the spread of revenge porn. However, their way of getting out ahead of the spread of the illicit material is to have potential victims send Facebook the potentially shared images over Messenger so the company can use image matching technology to prevent people from sharing it. This, as if you think about it for more than a minute will become clear, has some inherent privacy downsides. [CNBC]

12 tons
Colombian police seized over 12 tons of cocaine Wednesday in the largest ever drug bust in the country. The blow was stored under “four farms in a banana-growing region,” which is certainly one way to obtain a second income in a difficult banana economy. Colombia produces 910 tons of cocaine per year, so this is literally more than one percent of all the cocaine in one raid. [Reuters]

36 undisclosed ships
An American Public Media investigation has found Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is financially linked to 36 ships he did not earlier disclose. This would bring the total number of ships Ross has a financial stake in to 75, mainly moving oil and gas around the world. This is an issue given the cabinet member has a large degree of influence on the international shipping industry he apparently directly benefits from. [APM]

90 percent
That’s the percentage of crashes that are caused by human error. As it stands, RAND forecasts 2.4 million road deaths over the next 50 years under current human drivers. With driverless cars that reduce error, that number will decrease. So with fully autonomous cars en route, we need to have a serious discussion of how safe we’ll require vehicles to be before allowing them on roads. On one hand, we can insist the cars would be perfect; the RAND analysis assuming nearly perfect autonomous vehicles hitting roads in 2040 would save 580,000 lives over the next 50 years. But introducing less perfect cars far sooner — say, cars that are 10 percent safer than the average human hitting streets in 2020 — you’d save 1,100,000 lives over the same 50 year period. [RAND]

6,752 store closings
That’s the number of announced retail locations in the United States that were scheduled to close in quarters 1 through 3 of 2017. That’s double last year’s total already, and it’s not like new retail locations are taking over: in the same period there were 3,044 location openings. [Bloomberg]

51,000 displaced Texans
According to mayors and county leaders who spoke at a Texas House subcommittee hearing, the long term response from the federal government to Hurricane Harvey has come up short. Over 51,000 Texans were still living in hotel rooms as of last week as they had been displaced from their homes and 26,000 are in temporary housing of their own selection. [The Texas Tribune]

9 percent
Percentage of tweets that hit the 140 character limit on Twitter, according to data from the company. Yesterday they increased the number of characters that can appear in a tweet to 280, thus ruining the service and doubling the length of rope available to Americans with which to hang themselves. Just think of all the careers that will be ruined with that extra 140 characters of self destructive firepower. [Ars Technica]

17 percent
Snap Inc., the public company behind Snapchat, took a beating yesterday after missing analyst revenue predictions. Shares were down 22 percent at one point before finishing down about 17 percent. The company announced it’s going to completely overhaul its core product, a risky if necessary venture for a public company to pull off. [Bloomberg]

48-47
A huge shocker in Tuesday’s election in Virginia is just how close the state house may be to flipping to Democrats. As it stands, Democrats have 48 House of Delegates seats in the bag and Republicans have 47. Five races are in recount territory where there’s a margin of 129 votes or fewer, and if all break the way they appear to be it’ll be a 50-50 split. [FiveThirtyEight]

53.9 percent
Democrat Ralph Northam had a resounding win of Virginia’s competitive gubernatorial election yesterday. Republican rival Ed Gillespie closely tied his fortunes to the president’s in the waning weeks of the election. It was a pretty great night for Democrats overall: Phil Murphy won in New Jersey and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio won reelection handily. [FiveThirtyEight]

600 square miles
Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is eliminating the driver in Phoenix. Beginning in the Chandler part of town, a group of test riders will be able to hail completely driverless cars to take them to and from locations in the area. Over time, that domain will expand to 600 square miles, and then further into cities outside of Phoenix. [Recode]

$700 million
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have overstated the extent of his own wealth, a ticked-off Forbes magazine reports. The magazine maintains a list of the richest 400 Americans, one that Ross was on for some time. Ross’s net worth was listed by the magazine last year at $2.9 billion — an amount Ross claimed was too low and should be closer to $3.7 billion. Imagine their surprise when financial disclosure forms needed to join the cabinet reported the “billionaire” had $700 million in assets. Forbes has removed Ross from their list of rich guys, and everyone involved comes off as super duper aggravated by this turn of events. [Forbes]

+1.15
You heard that Russian news, right? That story of how Russia interfered in American politics? If you’re thinking about Russian interference in the election of Donald Trump, you may watch MSNBC; if you’re thinking about Mueller’s charges about the White House campaign’s collusion, you may watch CNN; and if your mind goes to Uranium or Hillary Clinton or the Dossier, yeah, you watch Fox News, right? Talk of the “Dossier” was 1.15 standard deviations above the mean on Fox, just one finding from an analysis of the most common words used on the three cable news networks in what may be my favorite FiveThirtyEight politics story of the year. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 ISIS news items per day
Turns out the fall of Raqqa really put a dent into ISIS’s media strategy. Since the Islamic State lost most of its territory, media items from ISIS channels have dropped to 10 items per day from about 30 items per day, according to watchers of the wannabe nation’s propaganda outlets. [NPR]

22 percent
Percentage of Americans who are spiritual, but not religious, according to a new PRRI survey. Compare that to the 100 percent of guys you dated in college who identified as such. [PRRI]

90 percent
Percentage of the Japanese auto market that goes to Japanese automobile brands. Why that is — essentially, a superb dealer network that truly understands what Japanese consumers desire — is a major pickle for American manufacturers, who cant seem to break into the world’s third largest car market. [The Atlantic]

2020
Far too many companies have decided to adapt a “Vision 20/20” plan, according the research from the Wall Street Journal, as the upcoming year and the serendipitous connection to people seeing well has combined to a nearly perfect if overdone nomenclature for a five year plan. [The Wall Street Journal]

$105 billion
Broadcom is attempting to purchase Qualcomm for $105 billion. You may not know these companies off the top of your head, but it’s pretty likely the device you’re reading this on contains a chip manufactured by one of the two firms. [The New York Times]

$2.5 billion
The nation’s power utilities are just beginning to understand the costs of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. NextEra Energy, the owner of the largest utility in Florida, estimated $1.3 billion in damages last week. Duke Energy estimated $500 million in damages in Florida, Southern Co. estimated $150 million. NRG Energy put their costs at $40 million and Texas’ American Electric Power Co. put their costs at $250 million to $300 million. All told, about $2.5 billion. [Bloomberg]

$600 per month
That’s the top average rate in New York and London to rent a parking space. Investing in parking spaces — buying them for thousands of dollars, renting them for hundreds, and years later flipping them for hundreds of thousands — is a legitimate financial strategy, with all the benefits of owning real estate and none of the problems of dealing with tenants. [The New York Times]

11 arrested princes
Saturday night 11 princes, four ministers, and many further former ministers were arrested in Saudi Arabia. The most prominent of those arrested was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an international financier who controls Kingdom Holding and has had staked in Twitter, Apple, Citigroup and 21st Century Fox. [The New York Times]

8 percent
That’s the percentage of Facebook owned by companies controlled by Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire investor who also owns 5 percent of Twitter. New documents leaked indicate that the investments were backed by “hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin” obfuscated through shell companies. [The New York Times]

$121 million
“Thor: Ragnarok” had a huge weekend at the box office, pulling in $121 million domestically on top of $427 million over its two week international release. [The Associated Press]

68 percent
Percentage of people in STEM master’s degree programs last year who were international students, according to an annual survey of U.S. and Canadian universities. In 1994, only 40 percent of computer science Ph.D. students were international. [The New York Times]

70 percent
Percentage of Germans who support a new law that would make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram liable for fines up to a staggering 50 million euros. They’d earn those fines for leaving “manifestly unlawful” content up for more than 24 hours. Facebook has 28 million Germans on it, but the company has a bit of an image problem there because of the role it played in bringing attention to far-right nationalist groups, a political faction with which many Germans have some substantial historical problems.

4,000 members
Number of adherents to Ásatrú, a religious movement in Iceland that worships pre-Christian pagan gods like Thor, Odin, and Freya. It’s the largest non-Christian religion in Iceland. However, the group is now contending with an unfortunate problem: international white supremacist groups are attempting to co-opt the iconography of their faith. [The Atlantic]

41,000 blood samples
A study of a cohort of 6,700 children over 12 years analyzed 41,000 blood samples and discovered why people who have had dengue fever once will sometimes have a far more severe form if they get it a second time. Antibodies made to fight the first infection can fall to a low level, imperiling those people if dengue strikes again. [STAT News]

361,000
Number of people, according to new Nielsen data, who watched all nine “Stranger Things” episodes within the first 24 hours of their release. Each episode of the season has had over 4 million viewers per episode and 8.8 million viewers on average. Netflix disputes Nielsen’s numbers. [Variety]

$1.5 trillion
House Republicans have released their tax cut plan. Businesses benefit the most, with about $1 trillion in tax cuts coming from a reduction in the corporate rate cut, and another half trillion coming on the individual side through a realignment of tax brackets, the elimination of the alternative minimum and estate taxes, and an increase to the standard deduction. To pay for this, the bill caps the deduction for state and local taxes, limits the mortgage interest deduction, and gets rid of tax breaks for student loan interest, adoption, medical expenses and more.
