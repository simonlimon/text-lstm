26 percent
Percentage of U.S. law enforcement officers employed in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, California and Hawaii. These states have one unique thing in common, which is that there is no legal authority to revoke the occupational licenses for police officers who were sacked for misconduct. This has several effects, namely being that disgraced officers can just move to a different state or a smaller municipality to get back a badge. [Reason]

50.23 percent
A plebiscite in Colombia to approve or reject a peace deal brokered over four years of negotiations with the FARC guerrilla group ended with the deal being narrowly defeated. The final numbers saw 50.23 percent of the country voting to reject the deal to 49.76 percent in favor. Voting matters. [The Guardian]

145 mph
Hurricane Matthew, currently a Category 4 hurricane, is brewing in the Gulf of Mexico with winds reaching 145 mph. It’s on track to hit Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba today. [The Associated Press]

1992
The Buffalo Bills, coached by Rex Ryan, defeated Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots 16-0 in Foxborough. The last time Belichick was shut out at home was Sept. 27, 1992, when he was coaching for the Browns. [ESPN]

$1.5 million
A 5-gallon bucket of gold flakes was stolen from the back of a truck in Manhattan last Thursday. The bounty of flakes was bound for a Canadian refinery. It weighed 86 pounds, so police are presumably putting out an APB for people who do not skip leg day. [Gothamist]

$915,729,293
That’s the loss declared by Donald Trump on his income tax return from the year 1995. The New York Times obtained some of the GOP presidential nominee’s tax records from an anonymous sender. That sizable loss could mean Trump potentially avoided paying any federal income tax for the three years before and the 15 years after the filing, according to IRS rules at the time. [The New York Times]

CORRECTION (Oct. 3, 10:50 a.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described tax documents obtained by The New York Times. The Times was sent several pages of Donald Trump’s 1995 state returns, not federal.

20 percent
Percentage of Trump voters who say that men have too much influence in the country these days, compared to 50 percent of Clinton supporters who say the same. [ABC News]

34 years
USA Today is good for a lot of things: showing up outside of your hotel room, providing an even-keeled opinion about the teams in the NFC East, offering Arby’s coupons. Add to that list, for the first time in 34 years, a stance on the presidential debate. The paper’s editorial board has never before endorsed a candidate, and it still hasn’t. But Thursday it broke with tradition and denounced Trump: “By all means vote, just not for Donald Trump.” [USA Today]

64.6 percent
Probability that Democrats win the Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus forecast. [FiveThirtyEight]

70 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe that this election has brought out the worst in people. [Monmouth University]

93 percent
A Cambridge University study found complaints against police in the U.K. and the U.S. fell 93 percent after departments installed body cameras. [BBC]

$1.1 billion
After months of delay, Congress has finally agreed to spend $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus. [NPR]

0
Number of television advertisements from Donald Trump that are in Spanish. The Clinton camp is much more invested in bilingual ads. The campaign has sponsored upwards of 2,500 Spanish-language ads. [The Center for Public Integrity]

2 times
An Australian man named Jordan has been bitten by a venomous spider on his penis two times in the past six months. Both incidents occurred on a portable toilet, which I assume he will avoid for the rest of his life. [BBC]

19.36 percent
Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase. Hakuna Matata, Timon probably murdered a sibling in his youth. That’s right, a new study of mammalian murder found that meerkats were most likely to kill their own kind, with 19.36 percent of meerkat deaths inflicted by a member of their own species. [The Atlantic]

21 percent
Percentage of the 1.3 million words spoken by Homer on “The Simpsons” in the program’s first 26 seasons. A further 26 percent was spoken by Bart, Lisa and Marge combined. The main family was followed by Mr. Burns, and then by Moe Szyslak, who is better than dirt. Well, most kinds of dirt, not that fancy store-bought dirt… he and I can’t compete with that stuff. [Todd Schneider]

22.3 births
Teen pregnancy is at a major low; there were 22.3 births for every 1,000 girls 15 to 19 in 2015, down from 61.8 births in 1991. [Vox]

97-to-1
The Senate voted 97-to-1 and the House voted 348-to-77 to override a presidential veto. The bill in question will allow families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. The situation is complicated, but essentially the move could open up the U.S. to litigation in the future, and could result in Saudi Arabia pulling investments from the U.S. [The New York Times]

0.9 percent
Nobody wants to hear about other people’s fantasy football teams, but it is rather delightful to rip them. Last week 0.9 percent of ESPN fantasy players started Tom Brady, who is still serving a four game suspension because of Deflategate. Meanwhile, Trevor Siemian of the Denver Broncos did indeed play and was the best QB in Week 3, yet a mere 0.7 percent of players started him. I will never pass up an opportunity to mock New England fans who think a suspended Brady will still outscore players who actually take the field. [SportsCenter]

55 percent
Percentage of Americans who start an online shopping search at Amazon, a 25 percent increase from the same market research survey last year. [Recode]

1890
That’s when The Arizona Republic began publication. Since then, the newspaper has never once endorsed a Democrat for president — until Tuesday, when the editorial board supported Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. [The Arizona Republic]

$41 million
Wells Fargo has forced its CEO John Stumpf to give up $41 million in compensation over a scandal in which fake accounts were set up by sales employees to juice numbers. A further $19 million in stock grants was clawed back from Carrie Tolestedt, who ran the division behind the incidents. [The New York Times]

84 million
Average viewership across 13 television channels of Monday night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, according to Nielsen. That figure doesn’t even include those who watched online or watched at parties or bars. [CNN]

$1 billion
Jose Cuervo, the largest tequila producer on earth, is planning to go public with a potentially $1 billion offering. It would be the largest IPO in Mexico since 2014. [Bloomberg]

2
Number of times the letter “l” appears in the name Hillary, at least in the context of the Clinton running for president. This memo did not make it to Hofstra University, where all the tickets to Monday’s debate (which you can relive here) billed Donald Trump vs. some rando named Hilary Clinton. [Independent Journal Review]

35 to 40 percent
Percentage of calls to the Dept. of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Crisis Line that go to back-up call centers, according to the hotline’s former director. The director blamed bad work habits at the call centers for the overrun, and said that people who staff the back-up centers aren’t as well-trained to handle veterans’ needs. [The Associated Press]

42.4 percent
Yesterday alone FiveThirtyEight added more than 100 state and national polls to our database as pollsters released their pre-debate findings, and dang is it close.  Hillary Clinton had an average of 42.4 percent support in our national average compared to 41.0 percent for Donald Trump. But we had a debate last night, and Nate Silver says that because Clinton won, the polls should be kinder to her in about a week. If they aren’t, that’s a very bad sign for Democrats. [FiveThirtyEight]

$160
Profits from an EpiPen two-pack, according to manufacturer Mylan, 60 percent higher than the company told Congress recently. The list price for the two-pack of the medication that prevents a horrible death from anaphylactic shock is $608. [CNBC]

219 lbs
According to USDA projections, by 2025 Americans will consume 219 pounds of meat per year on average. This decade that number has been about 211 pounds annually. [Gizmodo]

$2.6 billion
Some former employees of Wells Fargo — which sacked 5,300 people for opening accounts without the consent of its customers to satisfy sales targets — are suing the bank in a class action lawsuit for $2.3 billion in damages. The employees suing were fired because they didn’t meet the targets set by the company, targets they say were only attainable through illegal means. [NPR]

Tonight is debate night, so be sure to check the site this evening for a FiveThirtyEight live blog. I’ll be on ABC News’s digital stream of the debate shortly after 8 p.m. eastern. 

2nd highest of all time
“Fruit Ninja” is a popular mobile game, in fact the second-highest selling game on iOS ever. It will also be a movie produced by New Line, because too many people decided to see “The Angry Birds Movie” and we are sinners in the hands of an angry god. [The Hollywood Reporter]

2 points ahead
The first of three nationally televised presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump happens Monday night at Hofstra University. The race slightly favors Clinton by an average of two points in national polls, and she is a 58 percent favorite to win the presidency. You can watch the debate tonight on any television that is not already playing Monday Night Football. [FiveThirtyEight]

AB 1687
On Saturday California Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 1687, which would require an entertainment database site — the biggest and most well-known being IMDb — to remove an actor’s birthdate if it’s requested by a paid subscriber. The measure was pushed by the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA to combat age discrimination. [The Hollywood Reporter]

$22,000
It took almost five months for Ted Cruz to endorse Donald Trump, his party’s nominee for president, but only six weeks to cash in and rent out his vast email list to the nominee. Politico reports that Cruz was renting his email list to Trump well before the endorsement. A rate sheet obtained by Politico indicated that Cruz charges $22,000 to send one email to 280,000 donors and $51,000 to get in the inboxes of all 1.28 million of his supporters. [Politico]

$45,000
Truman Capote’s ashes sold for $45,000 at auction on Saturday. The original estimate of the likely selling price was a mere $4,000, which strikes me as rather low for the only remains of a beloved and highly regarded author. (Not that I’ve put all that much thought into the selling of the cremated bodies of literary figures.) But while we’re on the subject, how badly do you need to mess up your will to end up in this kind of situation? [The Associated Press]

$49.6 million
“Bundlers” are people who not only contribute to a campaign but also compel their friends and network to do so as well. It’s common for presidential campaigns to acknowledge and disclose these people, and according to a Center for Public Integrity study of the Clinton bundlers, the top group of fundraisers is responsible for at least $49.6 million of the $275 million her campaign committee raised as of June 30.

7 percent
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has paid $8.2 million to businesses owned by the candidate and his family, according to an analysis of federal campaign-finance filings. That’s about 7 percent of the $119 million the campaign has spent overall. [POLITICO]

60 to 80 percent
Facebook recently told advertisers that it has been systematically overestimating the time its users spent watching videos on the site by ignoring views that lasted less than three seconds. According to a letter that ad-buying agency Publicis Media sent to clients, Facebook overestimated average viewing time by 60 to 80 percent for the two years in question. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.16 million
The Clintons bought the house next door to theirs in Chappaqua, New York for $1.16 million. That puts them at two-thirds of a Kennedy Compound. The write-up in the Post is so full of salt you’d need to disclose it on menus. [The New York Post]

$1.6 million
The Secret Service compensates campaigns for the travel of its agents. The Clinton campaign has so far received $2.6 million, while Trump’s has received $1.6 million. But since Trump controls the company that owns the plane, he’s getting that cash personally in the end. [POLITICO]

95 million
Number of credit cards JPMorgan Chase issues annually, 60 percent of which come from a single manufacturing facility in Ohio. The company recently released the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which has substantial rewards that have credit cards obsessives — yes they exist — freaking out about the possibilities. The manufacturing facility moved two years’ worth of the cards in less than a month. [Bloomberg]

500 million
Yahoo! disclosed that hackers had stolen user information associated with 500 million accounts. The company said a “state sponsored actor” was behind the breach, which occurred in late 2014. [CNN]

4 manatees
A Florida man touched two adult and two calf manatees, prompting witnesses to call the police. While attempting to ride a manatee, the man chanted, “Take me to jail!” and the police happily obliged, because it is definitely illegal to harass manatees. [KAIT 8]

36.5 percent
According to a new poll, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has the backing of 36.5 percent of active-duty military service members, putting him second behind Donald Trump, at 37.6 percent. Clinton is more well regarded among officers than among enlisted personnel. The Navy put Johnson in first place, while more than half of Marines are for Trump. [The Military Times]

75 percent
A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked Americans whether they had a favorable opinion of a variety of people, organizations and entities including Barack Obama, both major political parties and the media. The highest favorable rating went to none other than Canada, which drew a positive reaction from 75 percent of respondents and a negative reaction from only 3 percent. Canada for President. [Mark Murray, via Luke Kawa]

95 percent
In 2012, 71 percent of contributions to major-party presidential candidates from donors who appear to be Jewish went to Barack Obama; 29 percent went to Mitt Romney. This time around, Jews have ditched Trump: 95 percent of money from donors who appear to be Jewish has gone to Hillary Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

3.5 million people
Puerto Rico lost power early Thursday, dropping 3.5 million people into the dark. [WSVN]

$2.6 billion
Several different brands of shoes recently introduced bulky, “ugly” footware that is panned by fashion publications. Still, the state of our busted shoe market is strong: Uggs and Crocs make $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion a year in revenue, respectively, so there must be some people buying them. [Bloomberg]

2 years and 1 month
Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. The couple separated on September 15, which was a little more than two years after they married. “Is this really a significant digit?” you may ask, to which I say: In the past 10 years, these people have been on magazine covers more often than the damn barcode, Brad Pitt became national poster boy for my “When Good Beards Go Bad” campaign, and Jolie is such a great actress she made “Beowulf” watchable. So yeah, it’s germane to the national conversation. [CNN]

29 percent
Share of those making more than $150,000 per year who have less than $1,000 in savings, according to a study from GoBankingRates. For those who make $100,000 to $149,999, it’s closer to half. [Bloomberg]

58.6 percent
The probability that Democrats will control the U.S. Senate after this year’s election, according to the just-launched FiveThirtyEight Senate model. So just in case the presidential ever starts looking like a blowout in either direction, we’ve got you covered for your next source of political panic. [FiveThirtyEight]

242 home runs
The Cincinnati Reds have set a new baseball record, but it’s the bad kind: After allowing their 242nd home run in the eight inning of Monday’s game against the Cubs, they beat out the 1996 Tigers for most home runs allowed in a season. [NBC Sports]

179,015 Canadian dollars
An employee of the Royal Canadian Mint is alleged to have stolen CA$179,015 (about $136,0000) in gold from the mint. The state’s case claims the man removed the gold, er, the old fashioned way: 7.4 ounces at a time, in his anus. [The Ottawa Citizen]

$258,000
Donald Trump’s charity on four occasions spent a combined $258,000 to settle lawsuits that involved the candidate’s businesses. This may violate laws against “self-dealing.” [The Washington Post]

2 “stolen” bags
Ahmad Khan Rahami allegedly placed two bombs in Chelsea in Manhattan this past weekend, but the plot was partially foiled by two men snatching the bag that one of the bombs was stowed in. Two guys saw an unaccompanied suitcase, took the pressure cooker out of it — presumably the pair was all set on the home-goods front and just needed some luggage — and made off with the bag, accidentally disabling the bomb in the process. Later, two homeless men took a backpack from a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, only to find a bomb inside of it too. (They alerted police.) I am now seriously interested in how many terror plots are inadvertently broken up by people who don’t want to schlep out to IKEA for new luggage. [DNA Info]

2.5 wins
That’s how many wins the FiveThirtyEight NFL model estimated the New England Patriots would have in their first four weeks of football if they did have Tom Brady at the quarterback position. They did not, but after two wins in two games, New England is poised to beat that without Brady, and even without his backup Jimmy Garoppolo. [FiveThirtyEight]

3 percent
A mere 3 percent of American adults own 133 million of the estimated 265 million guns in the country. These super-owners have an average of 17 guns each. [The Guardian]

25.75 percent
Percentage of Americans who are in school right now (well, in 2014) according to the U.S. Census Bureau. About 9 percent of the nation is in elementary school, 8 percent in middle or high school, a little more than 7 percent in undergraduate or graduate studies, and 1.5 percent are in preschool. [Overflow Data]

28.4 years
Average age of the highways and streets in the United States. Both major-party candidates have promised higher spending on infrastructure improvements, which could be a boon for the nation’s power grid, roads and public transit systems. [The New York Times]

3500 milliampere hour battery
A bunch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones are exploding, which is bad. One reason for this is that Samsung — seeing a weak offering from competitor Apple this year — accelerated the development and production of the phone and upgraded the 3000 milliampere hour battery in the previous model to a 3500 mAh battery in the Galaxy Note 7. Honestly, though, a phone that may or may not explode still seems like a more sensible investment than one without a headphone jack. [Bloomberg]
