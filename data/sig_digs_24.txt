About 60 percent
Percentage of the Department of Energy’s budget that goes to the National Nuclear Security Administration. Which makes Donald Trump’s decision to nominate former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to run Energy a bit weird. Texas is an energy-rich state, so Perry has a lot of experience with those industries. But, despite its name, the Department of Energy spends much of its time focused on designing, securing and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. [The New York Times]

More than 70 percent
Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is Trump’s pick to run the State Department. He’s got an interesting resume: More than 70 percent of Exxon’s untapped oil reserves are outside of the United States, in other countries, and the diplomacy required to obtain and maintain those reserves isn’t too dissimilar from the type required at Foggy Bottom. [FiveThirtyEight]

176,000 gallons
A North Dakota oil pipeline ruptured and dumped more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil into Ash Coulee creek, which then spread the spill onto an unknown amount of U.S. Forest Service and private land. This incident happened just 150 miles away from the Standing Rock protests, which are trying to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline being built on tribal lands for fear a pipe rupture could contaminate their water supply. [The Guardian]

4.18 million books
Sales of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” so far this year. Some people in the publishing community consider the book — it’s really a script for a play by the same name — a continuation of the Harry Potter series. Some people in the newsletter-writing community consider it a cash-grab that made the main characters “platonic” in the pursuit of mass-market appeal. Still, those 4.18 million copies are nearly four times as many sales as the runner-up, Paula Hawkins’s “The Girl on the Train,” so I guess that’s that. [Quartz]

19.4 million deaths
Of the 80.4 million deaths that occurred in the U.S. from 1980 through 2014, 19.4 million were listed with “garbage code” causes, according to a new study. These codes are extremely generic and nondescript, like “unspecified stroke” or “unspecified heart disease,” which don’t add much clarity to what caused the stroke or cardiac arrest. [FiveThirtyEight]

$200 million
The Oakland City Council and Alameda County Board of Supervisors approved a term sheet that would have the City pay $200 million to help build the Oakland Raiders a new stadium. The plan also gives the Raiders a plot of land worth $150 million. This is all part of an effort to convince the Raiders not to pack up and head to Las Vegas. Let’s see what Vegas’s counteroffer looks like. [Deadspin]

2 hours
Nike has launched a new project, “Breaking2,” and assembled a team of “designers, scientists, coaches, and statisticians” with one goal: get someone to run a marathon’s 26.2 miles in less than two hours. The current record is 2:02:57. The company’s recruited a number of distance runners and plans to hold the record-breaking marathon in the Spring of 2017. [Wired]

16 Republican senators
Have expressed support for investigating alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. These senators may also make it difficult for Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson — the ExxonMobil CEO who has ties to Vladimir Putin — to win Senate confirmation. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 weeks
American Express is drastically expanding its parental leave policy, now offering 20 weeks at full pay for both mothers and fathers. [Fox 6]

54 percent
Percentage of Americans who have heard “nothing at all” about the “alt-right,” the white nationalist movement that gained prominence during Trump’s campaign for the presidency. And 30 percent of people who have heard “a lot” or “a little” about it aren’t sure what it stands for. [The Pew Research Center]

1.25 million
The hottest selling CD of the year is from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who sold 1.25 million CDs in five weeks according to Billboard, blowing away all his younger (and alive) competition. There’s a catch, though: Universal Music Group dropped a box set of Mozart’s complete discography to mark the 225th anniversary of his death, and each of the 200 discs in the set counts as a sale. So only about 6,000 buyers are responsible for Mozart topping the pops. [Quartz]

$1 billion
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected challenges to an NFL plan to pay $1 billion to settle lawsuits related to concussions filed by former players. The plan covers an estimated 20,000 NFL retirees for the next 65 years. [PBS]

8 satellites
NASA is launching eight satellites today as part of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System mission. The satellites will track winds speeds using reflected GPS signals in an effort to monitor how hurricanes grow and improve our ability to forecast their intensity. [Space.com]

12 percent
Percentage of transgender Americans who reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom in the past year, according to a new survey of 27,715 respondents — the biggest poll of transgender Americans ever. Sixty percent have avoided using a public restroom all together out of worry a confrontation will happen. [Reuters]

29 percent
Percentage of Americans who regularly work weekends. Another 27 percent regularly work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Hello, my compatriots. [Thrive Global]

52,404 deaths
U.S. deaths from drug overdoses were up 11 percent in 2015, claiming 52,404 lives, according to annual statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increase was driven by overdoses on heroin and prescription painkillers. Drug overdoses are involved in more deaths than car crashes and guns. [CBS News]

7.9 million downloads
Amazon recently launched “The Grand Tour,” a car show featuring former talent from “Top Gear.” And apparently a lot of people want to watch the show but aren’t willing to subscribe to Amazon Prime to do it. According to a firm that analyzes piracy data, the first episode was downloaded 7.9 million times, and “The Grand Tour” has become “the most illegally watched show ever.” [Jalopnik]

$11.6 million
Amount of money given to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign (including allied super PACs and the Republican National Committee) by six of his cabinet nominees and their families. [The Washington Post]

10 percent
Portland has passed a tax that targets companies where the CEO makes 100 times as much money or more than the average employee. City businesses pay a tax of 2.2 percent of net income, but companies where the CEO makes more than 100 times as much will be assessed a further 10 percent tax, and if they make more than 250 times as much the penalty is a further 25 percent tax. [CBC]

5,000 patacas
Casino stocks were sent tumbling after China capped the amount of money UnionPay customers can withdraw from a Macau ATM to 5,000 patacas, or around $626. Macau is an immensely important gambling site that has seen worldwide investment. [Bloomberg]

97,000
It’s not just bees: Giraffes are dying at an alarming rate. The giraffe population is down to 97,000 in 2015, down from 155,000 in 1985. [BBC]

£2.4 million
In the U.K., weekly sales of vinyl records exceeded those of digital downloads last week. Vinyl sales amounted for £2.4 million while downloads had £2.1 million in sales. [The Independent]

11 million
Number of copies of “Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer” sold, which is ridiculous. [Mental Floss]

$3.8 billion
Google’s search, Android, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Cloud, and Pixel made $26.8 billion in operating income last fiscal year. They’re paying for a number of “moonshot” programs: Nest, Verily, Access, X, Sidewalk Labs, Jigsaw, DeepMind, and Calico cumulatively lost $3.8 billion. [Bloomberg]

€0
Cost to take the Paris Metro right now. Due to smog conditions, the city has made public transportation free and has banned half the vehicles from the road at a given day. Related: I’m asking for a friend who is sick and tired of the MTA and could use some extra cash around the holidays, but does anyone know how to generate a substantial amount of smog? [The Independent]

5
So far five babies have been born with “Zika-related brain developmental symptoms” in New York City. [The New York Times]

11 times
People who groomed their pubic hair were found to be more likely to have an STD, with those who remove all of it more than 11 times per year more than four times as likely to have an STD. This was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, which as far as branding goes is up there with the “Great Dismal Swamp” when it comes to bad names for things you want people to enjoy. [NPR]

28 percent
For a typical family, that’s the percentage of income that goes towards rent as of 2014. In 1980, that figure was 25 percent. [Gallup]

59 percent
Percentage of Americans who want abortion to be all or mostly legal, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center poll, largely unchanged since a 1995 ABC News/Washington Post poll that found the same number in favor. Ohio is considering a bill that would make abortion illegal around only six weeks after conception. [FiveThirtyEight]

9,684
Number of consecutive snaps played by Joe Thomas, a left tackle — among the best in the NFL — has played for the Cleveland Browns. He has outlived 6 head coaches and 18 starting QBs. He may be on an organization that goes 0-16 this year. He still shows up. As far as I am concerned Joe Thomas is an inspiration to us all. [ESPN]

Jeff Fisher coaches the Los Angeles Rams, a team that has uniformly failed on offense with little sign of improvement. If the Rams lose one more game this season, Fisher will become the fifth-ever coach in the NFL to achieve five consecutive losing seasons with the same team. Three of his potential predecessors were sacked; the last was Tom Landry. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 seconds
Donald Trump tweeted about wanting to cancel a Boeing government contract 35 seconds after 8:52 a.m. yesterday. It took a full 10 seconds before the market reacted, sending the price of Boeing stock down. That chunk of time — ten seconds seems like a few heartbeats but in algorithmic computerized trading it’s a freaking lifetime — shows that the Street potentially hasn’t fully figured out how to trade on Trump’s tweets. [CNBC]

+18.8 points
The final contest of the 2016 election cycle — the Louisiana Senate runoff election this Saturday — is polling like it’s going to be a shellacking, with Republican John Neely Kennedy polling 18.8 points above Democrat Foster Campbell in the four polls taken since election day. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 percent
That’s the percentage of film reviews that come out two days or earlier before a movie release. The crux here is that you probably should take early scores from review aggregators with a grain of salt, as loads of movies see a big slip in the ratings right before hitting theaters. [FiveThirtyEight]

100 percent
Google expects that 100 percent of its data centers and offices’ power will come from renewable energy sources by 2017. [Google Blog]

$60,000
Iowa will pay two Californians $60,000 after their bankroll was seized by Iowa State Patrol troopers in a warrantless search as part of an asset forfeiture. The Californians sued, and the state of Iowa not only will return the inappropriately ripped off cash but will also disband its state forfeiture team. [Iowa City Press Citizen]

23 percent
Remember Pokemon Go? Well Sony’s got a game in Japan called “Fate/Grand Order” that’s giving it a run for its money, to the point that it’s single-handedly responsible for a 23 percent increase in operating profit for Sony Music in the latest quarter. [Bloomberg]

664 retractions
Number of retractions of scientific papers on MEDLINE, a database of scientific abstracts, in 2016. That’s in line with 2015’s figure of 684 retractions. [Retraction Watch]

10,000+ votes
Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina has finally conceded his re-election race to Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has a lead of more than 10,000 votes in the state. McCrory vastly underperformed the other statewide races — Donald Trump won the state by about 100,000 votes, and Sen. Richard Burr won by about 200,000 — and the controversial HB2 law signed by McCrory regarding public bathroom usage that opponents considered anti-LGBT is a potential culprit. [New York Magazine]

$7 million
A one-of-a-kind Ferrari LaFerrari was auctioned off for $7 million, making it the priciest car sold that was made this century. The proceeds benefit the National Italian American Foundation’s Earthquake Relief Fund, which directs funds to earthquake relief. [The Verge]

$35 million
President-elect Donald Trump resides in New York City, in case you had not yet heard. Regrettably, so do like 8.4 million other people. As a result, New York City is spending a crapload of money putting police officers between those nine million people and Trump Tower. Mayor Bill de Blasio is asking the Obama administration for $35 million to pay for all those cops between election day and January 20. [New York Daily News]

$125 billion
A report that indicated the Pentagon could save $125 billion over five years by cutting bureaucratic waste among the 1,014,000 back office personnel — 268,000 of whom are outside contractors — was suppressed by leaders after the potential waste far exceeded expectations. [The Washington Post]

19 percent less bandwidth
Netflix has started letting users download shows and movies to view offline — which somehow uses less bandwidth than regular streaming. Part of this is how Netflix moves files around; the H.264/AVC High video encoding used for iPhone video downloading uses 19 percent less bandwidth on average compared to streaming. [Variety]

20 years
The Florida orange crop is less than a third of what is was 20 years ago, but appears poised for a comeback with agricultural innovations helping farmers beat a blight on their trees. [NPR]

60 percent
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after the failure of a referendum he proposed that would mitigate the power of the senate. He lost the vote 60 to 40. [Bloomberg]

93 percent
An annual U.K. survey asking people whom they trusted most found nurses absurdly credible, with 93 percent of people trusting them. [The Guardian]

Over 200
Von Miller, a linebacker for the Denver Broncos, has sent every player in the AFC West — starters and practice squads alike — a bottle of custom Cabernet Sauvignon and a thank you note. That’s well over 200 people. [The Denver Post]

517 companies
Number out of 887 companies that obtained a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, which evaluates LGBT policies. That figure is up from 407 companies last year, with groups like Wal-Mart — which recently added insurance coverage for transgender employees — updating workplace policies since. Still, 8 percent of companies don’t have hiring and firing protections. [Bloomberg]

Number of phase two studies sponsored by the non-profit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies looking into medical uses of MDMA, the club drug that is seeing new life as a potential treatment for PTSD. [The Guardian]

40 percent
Nestle will cut sugar in its chocolate by 40 percent thanks to a breakthrough that the company says makes it possible to use less sugar without affecting taste. [BBC]

100 petabytes
Techies used to talk about the “sneakernet“: In an earlier era, it was sometimes faster to transfer large amounts of data by physically walking the drive to its destination, rather than sending it over the internet. Later, it sometimes made sense to put a computer server in your carry-on luggage rather than sending a terabyte of data across the country. Now, sneakernet has achieved its final form: Amazon Web Services has introduced Snowmobile, which is a tractor trailer that can hold up to 100 petabytes of data. Amazon will literally drive a tractor trailer to your data center, upload 100 petabytes over the course of like a week, and haul it away for backup elsewhere. [Motherboard]

527.12 percent
Increase in Starbucks share price since January 2008, when Howard Schultz became the CEO of the company again. Schultz announced he will be leaving the position to lead a subgroup in the coffee company seeking to launch a high-end coffee shop brand. He will remain as chairman. [The Wall Street Journal]

After public pressure from President-elect Donald Trump, Carrier announced it will maintain about 1,000 jobs in Indiana of the 2,100 it had said it will move to Mexico. [Reuters]

$30,000
NASA has put out a solicitation for solutions to the oldest problem civilization has known: how to handle poop. Basically, they need a way to keep urine and feces away from astronauts for at least 144 hours in microgravity. The current solution is diapers. The winners can get up to $30,000 and presumably the eternal gratitude of future spacefarers able to maintain their first dignity while in orbit. [SF Gate]

12 to 15 years
Anita Thompson, the widow of writer Hunter S. Thompson, will clone and sell the late journalist’s marijuana stash. Essentially, the acclaimed and too often poorly imitated author of “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72” left a weed stash after his suicide in 2005, and the remains of that stash — which is 12 to 15 years old — will be cloned and available on the free market. At least when people try to imitate his lifestyle in the future, they will be smoking weak-as-hell ganja. [CNBC]

134 to 63
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi beat a challenge from Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to remain as the House minority leader. She’s held the top job among House Democrats since 2003, but Ryan’s 63 votes far exceeds an earlier contender for the gig, Heath Shuler’s 43 votes in 2010, a potential sign of cracks in the coalition. [NPR]

1.5 million British pounds
The British pound contains meat. I mean, kind of: Animal fat is used in the production of the new five-pound note, and vegans aren’t thrilled. This was a fantastic opportunity for Bloomberg to interrogate exactly how much money was damaged by being eaten or chewed up, and apparently in the United Kingdom, money is a delicacy: Since 2003, nearly 1.5 million pounds have been destroyed by mastication. Using gold leaf in cuisine was a dangerous slippery slope, is what I’m saying. [Bloomberg]

$108 billion
How much money in student debt — through the current school year — that the U.S. government will forgive in coming years. [The Wall Street Journal]

$118 billion
In 2014, an estimated $118 billion in sales were lost domestically by cards being declined when they should not have been. This hits very close to home; the hallmark of a good weekend out of town for me is a call from Wells Fargo asking if some madman has stolen my card and spent hundreds of dollars in liquor stores, bars, casinos and restaurants. When my debit card gets declined due to suspicions of fraud in some Delaware gas station on the ride back to New York, it means I did the weekend right. [The Wall Street Journal]

870 billion
Number of cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris annually. The company has invested $3 billion into tobacco vaporizers, already available in some overseas markets, and plans to have the product in 20 markets this year. [Reuters]
