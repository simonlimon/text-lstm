$10.75 per hour after expenses
Based on internal Uber documents BuzzFeed obtained, that’s the effective hourly wage for an Uber driver in the Houston area. [BuzzFeed]

44 percent
Percentage of Republicans and Democrats who said they almost never agree with the positions espoused by the other party, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. The polarization is pretty grim: 55 percent of Democrats said the GOP makes them feel afraid and 57 percent of Republicans said the Democrats make them feel frustrated. [Pew Research Center]

16,000 a day
Average number of people who signed up for TSA PreCheck, a service that claims to get passengers through airport security faster than the main lines, in the month of May. That rate has been climbing steadily, and lo and behold would you believe there’s now a long line for PreCheck as a result? There’s no winning with this agency. [The New York Times]

$500,000 per episode
The “Game of Thrones” leads are negotiating with producers for their salary in the show’s final two seasons, and reports indicate Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are looking at $500,000 per episode paychecks, up from the reported $300,000 per episode they made in season six. [Vulture]

$8.2 million
Annual NSF funding to the Arecibo Observatory, the largest radio telescope on earth. Due to budget problems, the NSF may have to cut some of that funding. How does a large telescope in Puerto Rico make the cut for Significant Digits? Well for starters it’s totally that telescope from “Goldeneye,” the best Bond movie ever and the one where James Bond drops a superstructure on Sean Bean. And as the spokesman of the small, yet vocal fan community surrounding Alan Cumming’s widely beloved performance as Boris Grishenko in the 1995 film, I say in one resounding voice: Save. This. Telescope. [National Geographic]

187 billion pounds
Expected weight of electronic waste that will be produced globally this year. Grinding up those circuit boards and extracting the valuable elements in them is a fluctuating business, but a necessary one given that just dumping non-renewable metals into a dump isn’t sustainable. [The Verge]

0
The number of deaths at EDC Las Vegas — that’s the Electric Daisy Carnival, a music festival that has some notoriety for being a place of extensive pharmaceutical consumption without the approval of a physician, if you catch my drift. It’s the first time since 2013 that nobody died at EDC. On Sunday there were 212 medical calls and 40 felony narcotics arrests. But a great year, all things considered. [Los Angeles Times]

59.6 percent
Percentage of tweets from Donald Trump between Nov. 5 and June 2 that contained one exclamation point. About 10.4 percent contain two or more exclamation points. He appears to be enjoying himself during the run for the White House. About 7 percent of Hillary Clinton’s tweets from Nov. 15 to June 8 had at least one exclamation point. Sad! [FiveThirtyEight]

71 percent
A new SurveyMonkey poll of Britons found a very narrow lead — 49 percent to 48 percent — for the “Leave” campaign in Britain’s referendum on whether to be part of the European Union. One crucial angle here: the youth of Britain want to stay in the E.U.: 71 percent of 18-24 year olds said they plan to vote “remain.” [Business Insider]

87 out of 100
Chick-Fil-A has obtained the highest-ever recorded score on the American Customer Satisfaction Index for a fast food chain, an 87 out of 100. Customer satisfaction with fast food restaurants in general is on the rise. [MarketWatch]

$1,100,513
Donald Trump’s campaign spent $6,735,026 in May, $1,100,513 of which went to Trump’s personal accounts, one of Trump’s businesses, or a member of Trump’s family. [ABC News]

$2.86 billion
Speaking of a man who moved money from one part of his life to another, Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has offered to buy a different company Musk is a major shareholder in, SolarCity Corp., for $2.86 billion. The move would cost Musk quite a bit of money personally but in the end would consolidate his holdings and bail out SolarCity, which has been struggling. [Bloomberg]

0 occupants
A bouncy house at a child’s birthday party was swept up by high winds and blown into power lines in Niagara, New York, this past Saturday. Since it had no occupants at the time, this went from “horrifying catastrophe” to “hilarious must-see video” nearly immediately. [ABC News]

3rd place
This year’s Golden State Warriors had a serious chance at being the best-ever NBA team, but their loss in the NBA Finals means they’re not even in the top two. The 2015-16 Warriors, with a blended Elo score of 1798 on the season, finished behind the 1995-96 and 1996-97 Chicago Bulls. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 bot makers
Twitch, a video streaming service that is a subsidiary of Amazon, has filed a lawsuit against seven bot makers, claiming that they are responsible for inflating view counts and subscriber numbers on the website. Twitch is pretty much throwing the whole book at them, claiming “federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, fraud, breach of contract, and tortious interference,” according to Quartz. Dang. [Quartz]

44 percent
British voters will vote on a referendum to exit the European Union on June 23, and based on the latest polling it’s going to be very tight. An Opinium poll has “leave” and “remain” camps tied with 44 percent each, and two YouGov polls put the support for each side within a point or two of each other. [ABC News]

30,799,000 viewers
Average audience of Game 7 of the NBA Finals this year. It was the NBA’s most-watched game since Game 6 of the 1998 finals, when Michael Jordan’s Bulls beat the Utah Jazz. [CNNMoney]

10.8 percent
The U.S. gross domestic product grew 10.8 percent between the first quarter of 2008 — its pre-recession peak — and the fourth quarter of 2015. For comparison, the GDP of the Eurozone’s only grew 0.6 percent, and Japan’s grew 0.1 percent. [The Wall Street Journal]

30 paid staff
Estimated paid staff the Trump campaign said it had on the ground across the country. Judging by previous campaigns, that is an … atypical number of staffers to have at this point. [The Associated Press]

96 percent
That’s the percentage of films in which Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson uses violence in some way shape or form, prior to the release of “Central Intelligence” this past weekend. The lone exception in his career was “The Game Plan,” a fluffy PG-rated Disney movie. “Central Intelligence” had a good opening weekend, finishing behind “Finding Dory” but still hauling in $34.5 million. [FiveThirtyEight, Box Office Mojo]

93-89
In case you live too far from Cleveland to have heard an entire city shouting into the night, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors 93-89 last night in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. It is Cleveland’s first major sports championship in 52 years. [ESPN]

$38,000 a day
Secret service protection for a presidential candidate can cost upwards of $38,000 per day. Sen. Bernie Sanders, despite the fact that it appears he will not obtain his party’s nomination, has not yet suspended his campaign, so he still gets that protection. And that could remain the case through the convention. [The Washington Post]

$1.2 billion
Amount of money Starbucks is holding that came from funds pre-loaded onto a Starbucks card or their app as of the first quarter. [Huffington Post]

1.5 cents per ounce
Philadelphia has become the first major American city to pass a tax on soda. The tax — 1.5 cents per ounce — will be levied on distributors. While it’s a bit unclear how much more consumers will end up paying as a result of the tax, it may add about a buck to the cost of a two-liter bottle of soda. [NPR]

13 percent
Having kids makes you less happy than people who don’t have kids, according to research in a number of nations. A new paper in the American Journal of Sociology found that American parents are 13 percent less happy than American non-parents. It’s the largest gap in the set of 22 developed countries studied. “The researchers,” Quartz wrote, “looked at what impact policies such as paid sick and vacation leave and subsidized child care have on closing that gap. It was 100%.” [Quartz]

291 hedge fund liquidations
More hedge funds folded in the first quarter of this year than opened up shop: 291 funds liquidated, and 206 were formed. [Bloomberg]

$64 million
Amount the committee hosting the Republican National Convention is looking to raise. They have $50.5 million committed in cash and $7 million in free products and services, but many companies that have sponsored the GOP convention in the past have declined to participate this year. Gosh, I wonder what’s different this cycle? [Bloomberg]

The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin is looking like an increasingly good race for Democrats, and Sen. Ron Johnson looks like one of the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans up for election this year. Former Sen. Russ Feingold has the support of 51 percent of likely voters according to a new Marquette University poll. Johnson has 42 percent. [Marquette University]

New York Gov.

Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party assembled a fleet of about 30 vessels with pro-Brexit banners. Later, Bob Geldof, a singer, lead his own flotilla of anti-Brexit boaters, which was sprayed with water from a hose by the pro-Brexit armada. It’s insane. [The Washington Post]

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 on Tuesday in favor of the government’s argument that broadband internet is an essential utility like power or a landline telephone — whatever the hell that is — and should not be treated as a luxury good that requires little regulation, as business interests in the telecom industry prefer.

In 2014, 39 percent of doctorate recipients did not have a job or did not intend to continue their studies. That was up from 31 percent in 2009. Here’s the problem: More people are getting postgraduate degrees even as the job market for those degrees declines. [The Wall Street Journal]

3 words
Mongolia has an issue with addresses. A quarter of the country’s population is nomadic, and many of its roads don’t have names. So the government is switching to a system devised by the startup What3Words, which has assigned a three-word phrase to every nine-square-meter area on the map. This will mean that every Mongolian residence will be mapped to a phrase. For instance, the U.S. embassy currently at “Denver Street #3, 11th Micro-District, Ulaanbaatar 14190” will instead be reachable at “constants.stuffy.activism.” Memorable, yeah? [Quartz]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Today we’re focused on the mass shooting that took place at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning. If this feels familiar, it should.

49 victims
A gunman armed with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in Orlando at 2 a.m. Sunday and killed at least 49 people over a three-hour siege. Thirty-nine victims were pronounced dead at the nightclub, called Pulse, and 11 were taken to hospitals where they were pronounced dead. The killer is also dead. It is the largest act of terror on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. [CNN]

53 injuries
At least 53 people were wounded in the attack, many of whom are still fighting for their lives. Orlando Regional Medical Center — which has a level 1 trauma center — admitted 44 patients, as many victims had severe gunshot wounds (nine victims were also pronounced dead at that hospital). By mid-afternoon Sunday, doctors had operated on 26 people. [The Orlando Sentinel]

3 FBI interviews
The killer in the Orlando mass shooting, Omar Mateen, was placed on the terrorist watch list after being the subject of two FBI investigations, one in 2013 regarding comments he made that appeared sympathetic to terrorists and one in 2014 after he had made contact with an American who went on to become a suicide bomber in Syria. The FBI interviewed him three times throughout that process. He was subsequently removed from the watch list. [The Los Angeles Times, The Hill]

8.3 times the victimization rate
The shooter is reported to have canvassed at least one other gay club in the Orlando area before settling on Pulse. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate crime statistics across many different demographics, and while its most recent data is from a 2011 analysis, the Center reported that the basic pattern holds year to year. From 1995 to 2008, there were 15,351 anti-LGBT hate crime offenses against people (that excludes crimes against property). The LGBT community makes up an estimated 2.1 percent of the population, yet accounts for 17.4 percent of the total reported violent hate crimes (and many hate crimes are never reported). LGBT Americans, therefore, were victims of hate crimes at about 8.3 times the expected rate. For perspective on that, it’s more than double the rates of Jewish and black Americans, more than quadruple the rate of Muslim Americans, and more than 41 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. [The Southern Poverty Law Center, The East Orlando Post]

85 percent
Between 2002 and 2014, 85 percent of people killed by terrorists in the U.S. were killed using guns. [FiveThirtyEight]

14 shootings
In the past 10 years, assault-style weapons have been used in 14 public mass shootings, according to The Washington Post. That includes the Orlando killings, the San Bernardino, California, attack and Umpqua Community College shooting in 2015 and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater and Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012. Of those 14 shootings, seven have occurred in the past 12 months. The 1994 ban on assault weapons expired in 2004, 12 years ago. [The Boston Globe, Michael Skolnik]

$1.2 million
The community response to the tragedy in Orlando has been overwhelming. Central Florida blood banks were at capacity and urged people to return later in the week. A GoFundMe to support the victims has already passed $1.36 million. And a LaunchGood from the Muslim community orchestrated by CAIR Florida has already raised more than $37,000. [The Orlando Sentinel, GoFundMe, LaunchGood]

UPDATE (June 13, 11 a.m.): This article has been updated to reflect a new casualty count from law enforcement officials, who said Monday that Mateen killed 49 people. The 50th fatality was Mateen, who was killed by police.

3-2
The San Jose Sharks beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-2 Thursday night in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final, keeping themselves in the quest for the cup for at least another game. Pittsburgh leads the series 3-2. [ESPN]

$10 each
Several states may have legalized marijuana, but we don’t have a good way to figure out if someone is high — a concern for drivers. Right now, the system is laborious, but researchers are working on faster methods of ascertaining the presence of THC in someone’s blood, such as a breathalyzer for weed. In one experiment, 14 Washington State University students got high and took a breath test that sought to detect marijuana levels. They were compensated $10 per breath exam, which as I understand it is essentially the American dream made real. [Bloomberg]

18 years old
Tinder is kicking everyone younger than 18 off its platform, answering the important question, “Jesus Christ, they seriously let kids on that thing?” Those ages 13 to 17 make up about 3 percent of Tinder’s active users, the company said. [Quartz]

33 percent
Percentage of respondents to a Gallup poll who said they would vote for a woman for president if she was qualified in every other respect. In 1937! Don’t freak out! Man, that is really the sort of thing I should have put at the beginning of the sentence. Things are a lot different now. [FiveThirtyEight]

46 signatures
Jerry Seinfeld recently indicated that he believes the world is clamoring for a sequel to his 2007 film “Bee Movie.” This is a delightful fiction. The AV Club went out to find this supposed “groundswell of support” and located a Facebook group with 27 members and a Change.org petition with 46 signatures imploring Hollywood to take the plunge and make a “Bee Movie” sequel. (Those numbers have increased with the AV Club’s coverage.)
But just think of the potential for a “Bee Movie” cinematic universe — not to mention all the unanswered questions put forward in “Bee Movie” and the hints embedded in the film designed to send all those die-hard “Bee Movie” book fans for a loop. I imagine Seinfeld can only hold out a short while longer before acting on the urge to get “Bee Movie 2” in the works. [AV Club]

206,528 spots
Combined number of television campaign ads aired by Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders so far this year, of which Kantar Media’s campaign media analysis group classified zero as negative. Going into the general election, it’s rather dubious that trend will continue. [Bloomberg]
