You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. In honor of the women’s (Sunday) and men’s (Monday) NCAA basketball championship games, as well as Major League Baseball’s opening day — and not at all because regular author Walt Hickey asked sportswriter Neil Paine to fill in for him — today’s edition is a special sports SigDig.

14 home runs
The number of dingers hit by San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner since the start of the 2014 season, including the two he belted on opening day Sunday. Not only is that far more than any other pitcher, but on a per-at-bat basis, Bumgarner has homered more frequently than all but 16 position players over the same span. Put him in the Derby! [Baseball-Reference.com]

23 points
Game-leading scoring total for South Carolina’s A’ja Wilson in the NCAA women’s championship Sunday night. As the Gamecocks were closing out their 67-55 victory over Mississippi State, Wilson carried the team on her shoulders with 7 points, 3 rebounds and 2 blocks in the fourth quarter. Afterwards, she was named the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. [NCAA]

40 triple-doubles
Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook has recorded 40 triple-doubles during the 2016-17 NBA season, his most recent being a 40-point, 13-rebound and 10-assist performance against the Charlotte Hornets Sunday. Westbrook is now just one triple-double shy of tying Oscar Robertson’s all-time single-season record of 41; he also needs to record just 29 assists and 11 rebounds over the Thunder’s remaining six games to guarantee he’ll join Robertson as the only players to average a triple-double for an entire season. [CBS Sports]

62 percent
Gonzaga’s odds of beating North Carolina in the NCAA men’s basketball championship Monday night, according to the FiveThirtyEight model. The Bulldogs are making their first-ever title-game appearance, while UNC is on appearance No. 11 (including a buzzer-beating loss just last year). But the stats give a clear edge to the Zags, who — according to the ratings of numbers whiz Ken Pomeroy — play the toughest defense in the country. [FiveThirtyEight]

111 wins
That’s the number of consecutive victories the Connecticut Huskies had reeled off going into the NCAA women’s tournament semifinal Friday night. But all great streaks have to end sometime, and UConn’s was snapped when Mississippi State’s Morgan William sank a game-winning jumper at the horn to seal the upset. Despite the loss, though, we should all take a moment or two to appreciate what Connecticut accomplished: From what we can tell, 111 straight victories is the longest winning streak a true team sport ever produced in college history. [FiveThirtyEight]

CORRECTION (April 3, 11:39 a.m.): An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the team against which Russell Westbrook collected his 40th triple-double. It was the Charlotte Hornets, not the Utah Jazz.

0 amputations
For the first time since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, deployed American soldiers went a full calendar year without needing a single combat amputation. That’s far down from what was happening during some of the most intense fighting; in 2011, troops received an average of 22 amputations per month. [Denver 7]

One-third of plays
Spring is slowly springing, and that means baseball season is upon us. Our venerable national pastime is still evolving, and my colleagues explored some of its recent developments. Looming among them: the dramatic rise of the defensive shift. The strategy was used on nearly a third of all balls in play last season. The batters who face the shift the most have suffered, and my colleagues predict we haven’t seen the last of its rise. [FiveThirtyEight]

1.5 meter debris shield
Two veteran astronauts — Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough — were on a planned spacewalk outside of the International Space Station when the debris shield they were installing floated away into the cold distance of space. The shield, meant to protect against micrometeorites, is now one of “21,000 other pieces of orbiting trash and debris” that can be tracked from Earth. NASA claims it poses no threat to the astronauts or the $100 billion craft. [The Guardian]

9 followers
On Wednesday, during a dinner outside D.C., FBI director James Comey revealed that he had a secret Instagram account with “nine followers.” On Thursday, Gizmodo writer Ashley Feinberg, after a cool bit of internet investigation, claimed to have found it. The account in question was named after Reinhold Niebuhr, a theologian about whom Comey had written a senior thesis. If it was Comey, he in fact had 10 followers, but had made a staggering 3,226 posts. [Gizmodo]

6,620 manatees
The manatee — that noble sea cow, magnificent creature of the shallows — is no longer an endangered species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service downgraded the animals from “endangered” to “threatened” thanks to an annual count that found 6,620 of them luxuriating in Florida waters. But not everyone is happy about the news. The executive director of Save the Manatee Club lamented the reduced protections that would follow and said that the reclassification would “seriously undermine the chances of securing the manatee’s long-term survival.” [Miami Herald]

250,000 vehicles
Roughly 250,000 vehicles drive through a stretch of I-85 in traffic-laden Atlanta every day. On Thursday, a 100-foot-long elevated section of that interstate collapsed, and ten of its lanes will be “closed for the foreseeable future.” The cause of the collapse was a massive fire, but no injuries were reported.

2 years
Two allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison over their involvement in politically motivated traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge. Bridget Anne Kelly was sentenced to a year and a half in prison and Bill Baroni was sentenced to two years. Both will have to perform community service and pay thousands of dollars in fines and restitution. [Bloomberg]

3 terms
A three-term member of Congress has stepped forward to be the Democrat who loses the Texas Senate race in 2018. Rep. Beto O’Rourke plans to announce on Friday his candidacy to challenge incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, continuing the Texas tradition of bold Democrats laying down their careers to pose a moderate speed bump for a Republican’s waltz to victory. [The Houston Chronicle]

4 years
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature may have agreed on a bill that would overturn House Bill 2, the law that barred city-level LGBT discrimination protections and forced transgender people to use the public bathroom of their birth sex. The new bill would put a four-year moratorium on new city ordinances protecting LGBT rights; LGBT advocates say the deal will “continue to actively discriminate against the LGBT community.” [The News & Observer]

35 minutes
SB Nation compared two virtually identical baseball games — 11-2 final score, 27 baserunners, about 270 pitches, about 75 batters — but one took place in 1984 and the other in 2014. The 2014 game, like many baseball games these days, was way too long, a full 35 minutes longer than the 2 hour 31 minute outing of 1984. Most of that extra time came from the time between pitches getting longer. [SB Nation]

68 contenders
To cap off Mars Month here at FiveThirtyEight, we ran Mars Madness, where we pitted 68 Martian missions and planetary features in a head-to-head bracket voted on by readers. My personal favorite — Korabl 11, a satellite that the U.S. government thought was an intercontinental ballistic missile as it crashed into earth — did not do well, but the Curiosity rover did.

$150 million
Republican Senators John McCain and Mike Enzi reintroduced legislation that would kill the penny, cut the cost of making nickels and replace the dollar bill with a $1 coin. Just that last one — switching to dollar coins — could save the country $150 million annually. [U.S. Senate]

Number of people, out of an initial 23, who stuck it out a full year in a reality show that marooned them in the Scottish wilderness. To make matters worse, the social experiment may have gone on for the full run, but the show tanked and Channel 4 stopped showing “Eden” after four episodes. [Variety]

The GOP-led House of Representatives voted 215-205 to allow internet service providers to sell data about customers without their permission. This includes medical, personal and financial data. Privacy advocates are furious. [NPR]

1,600 signatures
The Isle of Wight council called for the public to suggest names for a new floating bridge. That, naturally, led to a petition — which as of Tuesday had received more than 1,600 signatures — to name the ferry-like structure “Floaty McFloatface.” After initially vetoing the suggestion, the council now says it will consider it.

Congress is considering raising the minimum investment for an immigrant investor visa from $500,000 to $1.35 million. With the current program set to expire April 28, many foreign investors who want the U.S. visa are dumping money stateside to try to get that EB-5. [Bloomberg]

The special election to fill the GOP-leaning Georgia congressional seat vacated by now-Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price is heating up. Democrat Jon Ossoff is leading the 18-person field with 40 percent support, according to a FOX 5/Opinion Savvy poll.

Japan has an obsession with expertly grown, high quality fruit. While in the U.S. most people are content to snack on mass-produced grapes, in Japan stores sell immensely flavorful and specifically farmed fruits that are often given as gifts or enjoyed as delicacies. One extreme example: the muskmelon, the most obscenely ideal specimens of which can fetch $27,000 for a pair — [Slate]

A massive gold coin was stolen from the Bode Museum in Germany on Monday. The “Big Maple Leaf” has a face value of 1 million Canadian dollars ($750,000), but the gold it’s made of is worth about $4.5 million. Based on weight alone — this thing is 221 pounds of nearly pure gold — the theft is being investigated as a multi-person job. [ABC News]

20 percent
Generally, kids in the U.S. go to kindergarten when they’re five years old, but around 20 percent of U.S. kindergarteners begin at six, some of them because their parents held them back a year because of perceived advantages to waiting. That perception is backed up by one study that found postponing kindergarten led to more self control. But honestly, “study finds solution to immaturity is aging slightly” is a worse headline. [Quartz]

28
Number of members of Congress from the far-right “Freedom Caucus” that teamed up to block the House GOP’s health care bill. The legislation — which would have repealed some but not all of the Affordable Care Act — had too many Republican defections and never came to a vote. [POLITICO]

According to FiveThirtyEight’s forecasting model, Gonzaga is the favorite to win the men’s NCAA tournament with a 42 percent chance, followed by North Carolina with a 24 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

A study published in Nature found that about 50 percent of the platelets in the bloodstream are made in the lungs, not in the bone marrow as previously believed. [Nature]

74 percent
The University of Connecticut remains the strong favorite to win the women’s NCAA tournament, especially now that rival Baylor is out of the dance with a loss to Mississippi State. A loss, incidentally, that all but guarantees I win the FiveThirtyEight office women’s bracket. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 championships
It’s been one year since North Carolina Republicans passed HB2, a bill that banned cities from extending legal protections to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. It has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of economic losses and remains on the books. The NCAA — which moved March Madness games out of the state in reaction to the law — is considering where to hold six years’ worth of championship games next month. If North Carolina wants to be in that conversation, the clock is ticking for the GOP legislative supermajority and new Democratic governor to cut a deal. [POLITICO]

22 votes
House Speaker Paul Ryan can afford to lose only 22 GOP votes in any attempt to pass House Republicans’ bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. President Trump’s budget director said Thursday that today is the last day for the House to pass the bill before the president gives up and moves on to other priorities. The vote was supposed to be Thursday night anyway, so let’s see how this goes. [POLITICO]

25 trips
Because of travel restrictions proposed by President Trump, the Toronto District School Board will not approve new trips to the United States out of concern for students being turned away at the border. For perspective, about 25 trips involving 900 students are scheduled for the rest of the spring semester. [The Star]

149 spotlights
The Germans have used 149 spotlights to make an artificial sun that produces light that is 10,000 times stronger than natural sunlight on Earth. They can produce temperatures of 3,500 Celsius by directing them at a single spot. Listen, I’m not saying they made a death ray, I’m just saying they made a scientific device that shares a lot of death-ray-esque properties — and I think we need to have a more open conversation about the death-ray potential here, because I’m not 100 percent cool with a fake sun in a protective radiation chamber after seeing “Spider-Man 2.” [The Guardian]

The theoretical maximum efficiency of solar panel cells is 29 percent. The record for efficiency was 25.6 percent, but Kaneka Corp. has raised the bar and made a solar cell that was measured with 26.3 percent and later 26.6 percent efficiency. As the cost of solar panels decreases overall, energy from the sun is becoming an increasingly economical alternative to fossil fuels. [Ars Technica]

Cover crops are plants that farmers grow in the cold parts of the year that can help trap nutrients in the soil to keep them out of streams. They’re great for the environment but more work for farmers. Maryland built incentives for farmers — to the tune of dollars per acre — that led to more than 50 percent of corn fields on the Eastern Shore getting winter cover crops. [NPR]

To do that, Trump’s budget request includes funding for 20 additional Department of Justice lawyers. [The Texas Observer via Eric Umansky]
