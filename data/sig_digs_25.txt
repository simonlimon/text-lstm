1 point
Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh and ace kicker Justin Tucker have endorsed a senseless, ridiculous and honestly pretty awesome NFL rule that would give a team one point if they boot a kickoff between the uprights. In a tough year for kickers overall, Tucker is the only kicker to make every kick — 15 extra points and 27 field goals — and just this past Sunday got the ball between the uprights on a kickoff. [Fox Sports]

410 euros
The Dutch parliament has approved a ban on face coverings in public; the rule covers ski masks as well as burkas and niqab face veils. The fine is up to 410 euros, which is about $435. The Dutch Senate needs to approve the bill for it to become law in the Netherlands. [BBC]

506
A study suggests that about a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in outpatient settings in the U.S. were not appropriate. In 2010 and 2011, U.S. doctors wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 population, but only 353 were medically necessary. [JAMA, National Geographic]

$1,000
New York has made automated ticket bots super illegal, compared to the somewhat illegal they used to be. The previous fines were bearable by ticket scalpers, but the new ones are devastating: up to $1,000 or twice the gain from the crime, plus potential jail time. [The Verge]

1.3 million
Number of British citizens who live abroad in the European Union. In a parliamentary committee about health care for these folks, an interesting disparity came to light: There are about 70,000 British retirees living in Spain, but only 62 recorded Spaniards who thought to spend their golden years in the U.K. [Quartz]

4.8 million
Number of people aged 75 or older in Japan who have a drivers license, up from 2.4 million in 2005. Traffic accidents involving a driver aged 75 and up comprise 12.8 percent of incidents now, up from 7.4 percent a decade ago, and authorities are trying to get more 75-year-olds off the road by — no joke — offering discounts on ramen.

35 acres
Belgium will trade 35 acres of land to the Netherlands for seven acres of their land in a new agreement. Essentially, when you make a river a border for your nation in 1843, and then reconfigure the path of that river in 1961, you’re going to swap stretches of territory. It took the discovery of a headless corpse some time back and a subsequent jurisdictional kerfuffle to remind the nations they needed to deal with the land along the Meuse River at some point. [The New York Times]

552
Number of times Warren Dew commented on a FiveThirtyEight article from March 2014 through late November 2016. My colleague Christie Aschwanden wanted to find out what, precisely, motivates people like Dew to comment on articles on the internet, so she asked more than 8,500 people what their deal is. I will never forget being castigated in the comments for not properly identifying several background characters in the investigative journalism piece, “The ‘Charlie Brown Christmas Special’ Dancers You Most Want To Party With” last year. [FiveThirtyEight]

541,000
Japan is trying to deal with an estimated 541,000 “hikikomori,” young people who avoid school, work and interactions with people outside their families. It’s a pretty large problem — 1.6 percent of 15 to 39 year-olds in Japan are hikikomori. The Japanese government is working on bringing them back out into society. [Bloomberg]

$7 million
Zenefits agreed to pay $7 million as part of a settlement with California regulators over a scandal in which the company helped employees cheat on state insurance broker licensing requirements. The human resources startup owes half now and California will waive the other half if the company passes an examination in 2018. [Buzzfeed]

$9 million
New York City’s MTA wants to spend $9 million over the next four years on “24/7 social media.” That’s $2.25 million a year, around six grand a day. That’s enough to pay individual people hush money so they don’t tweet about the transportation agency’s complete inability run trains after midnight in most of the city. [Jalopnik]

2 percent
In what may be the biggest college football rivalry game of the year, No. 2 Ohio State beat No. 3 Michigan in double overtime, 30 to 27. Last week, Ohio State had a 61 percent chance of making the College Football Playoff and Michigan had a 37 percent shot, according to FiveThirtyEight’s college football predictions. Ohio is now a 90 percent chance of making the playoff, and Michigan’s chances are down to 2 percent. I went to William & Mary, not exactly a big time football school, but as I understand it the College Football Playoff is a recent innovation that decides who gets to eventually lose to Alabama on national television. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

3.7 kilometers
Back in October, the European Space Agency made a very, very expensive crater on Mars. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander did indeed land, but it did so with such a velocity that it left a discernible scar on the planet rather than coming to a gentle stop on the surface. The ESA announced last week that it has figured out more details about why: A terrifically bad reading from Schiaparelli’s inertial measurement unit made the lander think it was under the Martian surface when it was actually still 3.7 kilometers above it. [Gizmodo]

17 states
California’s bar association is considering a blanket rule that would ban sexual relationships between attorneys and clients. Several attorneys are not cool with this proposal. Indeed, as of May 2015 only 17 states adopted the American Bar Association’s ban on sexual relationships between attorneys and their clients. [The Los Angeles Times]

20 countries
President elect Donald Trump has business interests in at least 20 different countries. These businesses could present conflicts of interest for the president and pose potential security threats. [The New York Times]

90
Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro is dead at age 90. Cuba policy holds a unique place in the annals of U.S. policy discussion — Castro led Cuba over the course of 11 presidencies — so what happens next is really complicated. [FiveThirtyEight]

2002
For the first time since 2002, the Oakland Raiders will have a winning season. The Raiders are 9-2 after beating the Carolina Panthers. [The Guardian]

13 percent
People will probably buy more weed than usual this Friday. In Washington state, where recreational pot is legal, sales were up 13 percent on Black Friday last year compared to the average Friday. [Bloomberg]

68 percent
Percentage of Thanksgiving Day games that involved at least one of these teams: the Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. The NFL’s decision to not always feature their best teams on Thanksgiving — we’re looking at you, Detroit — means that the quality of Thanksgiving football is less than, say, the level of basketball exhibited in the NBA’s Christmas Day slate. [FiveThirtyEight]

82 percent
Percentage of middle school students who weren’t able to determine the difference between sponsored content and a real news article, according to a new Stanford University study. [The Wall Street Journal]

1,023 commutations
President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentences of 79 people imprisoned for drug-related offenses, bringing the total number of commutations he’s granted to federal inmates to 1,023. That is more than the previous 11 presidents combined. [The Washington Post]

More than 2 million
Hillary Clinton’s current lead over Donald Trump in the national popular vote. [David Wasserman]

$146 million
Estimated size of the market for aloe vera products in the U.S. Well, for products that claim to contain aloe vera, anyway. It turns out that store-brand aloe products sold in Target, Walmart and CVS didn’t contain any aloe at all, according to a lab analysis sponsored by Bloomberg News, despite listing it as one of the top two ingredients. [Bloomberg]

31 percent
Our coverage of the abysmal Cleveland Browns continues: The Browns have a 31 percent chance of going 0-16, according to FiveThirtyEight’s NFL Elo ratings. Is this gratuitous coverage of the Browns’ struggles due to my roommate, previously of Cleveland, failing to clean up a horrid mess left in the kitchen after preparing lemon scones this past weekend? I’ll leave that to you, dear reader, to decide. [FiveThirtyEight]

33rd best
Jurgen Klinsmann’s run as the U.S. men’s national soccer team coach officially came to an end on Monday. When Klinsmann began his tenure, the USMNT ranked as only the 34th best team in the world, according to our men’s soccer Elo ratings. We were an international joke with no hope of advancing to the top tier of global soccer. But after the U.S. soccer renaissance Klinsmann fostered, the USMNT is now sitting pretty at No. 33. The nation is eternally grateful for the progress Klinsmann achieved. [FiveThirtyEight]

$13,830,598
If $1,000 was invested in the Medallion Fund when it was created in 1988, it would now be worth $13,830,598. The fund — an investment vehicle run by hedge fund titan Renaissance Technologies — has created about $55 billion in profit over 28 years, and has unheard-of annual returns. Renaissance Technologies is one of those companies always preceded by a phrase like “notoriously secretive,” which makes this Bloomberg Markets feature on it all the more interesting. [Bloomberg]

$127.5 million
There is no feud as bareknuckled as a fine-art-world feud. In 2013, Sotheby’s sold “Christ as Salvator Mundi,” a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, on behalf of a group of art dealers. A company controlled by Swiss businessman Yves Bouvier bought the painting for $80 million. Bouvier et al then sold the painting for $127.5 million to a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev. The art dealers are now royally peeved, and are threatening to sue Sotheby’s over the roughly $47-million difference, presumably because the whole point of an auctioneer is to get the best price possible. Sotheby’s has now asked a federal judge to clear it of wrongdoing in the case. And this isn’t even the main dance: Rybolovlev is already suing Bouvier for overcharging him by at least $500 million on various other deals. [Bloomberg]

Nearly $212 million
Marijuana sales in Washington State in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $249 million sold in alcoholic spirits. [KING-TV]

261.6 billion barrels
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (a.k.a. Aramco) is the largest producer of crude oil in the world, but the state-controlled business is trying to diversify. I mean, it’s not diversifying that much — the company isn’t getting into the used-car game, or anything. But Aramco is building up its petrochemical manufacturing capabilities in an effort to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on the price of plain old oil. Still, the company says it has 261.6 billion barrels yet to come out of the ground, about 20 times as much as Exxon Mobil has, so it’s not exactly like its oil extraction business is in danger.

0-11
At least something is normal this year: Congratulations to the Cleveland Browns, now 0-11, who were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention with a loss on Sunday. Based on their chances in their remaining games, the Browns have an outside shot at going completely defeated. This is your 2016 #GPODAWUND. [CBS Sports]

4th term
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Sunday her intention to pursue, next year, a fourth term as the German head of state. [NPR]

35-23
Massive news out of Canada: The Ottawa Redblacks defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 35-23 and will advance to battle the Calgary Stampeders for the Grey Cup next week in Toronto. If you did not understand the previous sentence, it had to do with the Canadian Football League’s championship. Anyway, don’t worry about it; I hope you have a very good Thanksgiving this Thursday. [The Associated Press]

$100,000
Cost for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for one presidential visit to New York City. With Donald Trump reportedly planning to make Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan his weekend White House, New York is staring at regular, profound gridlock. [The Washington Post]

$25 million
Trump agreed to settle a number of lawsuits related to Trump University, the failed for-profit college, for an eye-popping $25 million. Based on what former employees said under oath, the venture “used high-pressure sales tactics and employed unqualified instructors.” Two federal class action lawsuits and a suit brought by New York’s attorney general will end as part of the settlement. [The New York Times]

£369 million
Cost of renovating Buckingham Palace. (That’s nearly $460 million.) The U.K. government agreed to fund the repairs lest the landmark suffer “catastrophic building failure.” The renovations will take place over 10 years. [The Guardian]

0.2 percent
It’s been a crazy mild November so far for the lower 48 states, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reporting that on Nov. 14 snow covered a mere 0.2 percent of the country, an all-time low. But don’t get used to the balmy temperatures. [The Washington Post]

5.7 percent
Sen. Bernie Sanders won 18,183 write-in votes in his home state of Vermont, which has certified its presidential election results. That’s 5.7 percent of the vote, a bit more than Gary Johnson and Jill Stein earned combined. [Burlington Free Press]

34.3 percent
Percentage of U.S. cropland overseen by farms larger than 2,000 acres in 2011. In 2001, these large farms ran less than a quarter of the country’s farmland. It’s just one measure of how much American farming has consolidated. [FiveThirtyEight]

500 McDonald’s
Approximate number of McDonald’s locations in the U.S. that currently offer table service. The bring-your-burger-to-you trial has proven sufficiently successful that the fast-food giant plans to bring table service to all 14,000 or so of its domestic locations. [Buzzfeed]

30,000 jobs
Volkswagen will cut up to 30,000 jobs as a cost-saving measure — through attrition, with no forced layoffs until 2025 — as the manufacturer tries to rebound from that time they totally lied about their emissions. [Bloomberg]

$650 million
The English Premier League has reportedly inked a three-year, $650 million deal with PPTV, a Chinese broadcaster, that will extend through the 2021-2022 season. It’s likely to be the biggest overseas TV deal ever for English soccer. [Bloomberg]

Number of times Bob Dylan will go to Stockholm, Sweden, in December to accept the Nobel Prize. The Svenska Akademien (Swedish Academy) knew what they signed up for when they picked Dylan as a winner. But he’s got six months starting Dec. 10 to give a lecture to the Nobel crowd — that’s the only requirement. [Svenska Akademien]

$3
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials announced Wednesday that the price of a MetroCard swipe could rise from $2.75 to $3.00 in March. And why not? After all, where else can you get phoned-in train service without all the amenities that come standard in every other metropolis? Where else will you find subway cars packed so tight that ass-grabbing is a given? What other transit authority could we find that treats weekend line closings as top secret? The best thing to happen to the M.T.A. is its proximity to the active fire hazard that is the Washington D.C. Metro. [The New York Times]

35 percent
Percent of female employees who rated as “engaged” in their work, compared to 29 percent of male employees. [Gallup]

208 miles per hour
A 19-year-old in Oklahoma was arrested after driving 208 miles per hour on the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City on Saturday, just over 200 mph short of the “wheel-driven” land-speed record. [Fox News]

Proposition 300
Denver voters passed a citywide proposition allowing people to consume marijuana in public spaces such as bars, restaurants and other businesses that get the OK from neighbors. (The vote was so close it took a week to settle the results.) As a New Yorker, this seems insane to me. Sure, Denver residents still can’t smoke marijuana in these spaces — they can only “consume” it — but the notion of doing anything fun in public besides eating and drinking was beaten out of New York by the end of the Bloomberg Administration. [The Associated Press]

8,711,000 Facebook interactions
Number of shares, reactions and comments on Facebook generated by the top 20 fake election stories in the last three months of the campaign. Hoax sites and partisan fabulists eclipsed real news during the stretch run of the 2016 election on Facebook: There were only 7,367,000 shares, reactions and comments on the top 20 stories from 19 major, fact-based publications during the same period. Come on y’all, be a part of the solution and like us. [Buzzfeed]

1 emu
Prince William County police captured an escaped emu Tuesday at about 9 a.m. in Haymarket, Virginia, and thank God for that. Australia lost a war against those gnarly birds once, and they aren’t to be underestimated. [The Washington Post]

10 weeks
President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, with a mere 10 weeks to form a government, had another batch of staff changes. The team dropped lobbyists and shed some help brought on by Chris Christie, the former transition chairman. [The Wall Street Journal]

47.9 percent conversion rate
Percentage of 2-point conversion attempts in the NFL since 2001 that were successful. That means the expected value of going for 2 is 0.96 points, which is slightly better than the expected value of just going for the point-after-touchdown kick from the 15-yard line. That expected value since the NFL moved the kick back is 0.94 to 0.95 points, but in fairness, Blair Walsh and Roberto Aguayo are in this data set and could be putting a toe on the scale. [FiveThirtyEight]

Are you an Apple fanatic who needs a new and pointless way to throw money at the company? Oh, you already have an Apple Watch? Well, have I got good news for you, then: Apple is out with a new book with 450 glossy photos of Apple products through the years. Flip rectangular page with rectangular product to the next rectangular page with the next rectangular product for the cool price of $300, presumably plus Apple Care. Sheep.

17,775
U.S. highway deaths in the first six months of the year, a jump from 2015. Some experts are blaming distracted driving (apps and smartphones). [The New York Times]

$25 billion to $35 billion
Snap, Inc. — the firm behind Snapchat — filed confidentially for an initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. Expected post-IPO valuations for the company range from $25 billion to $35 billion, with some estimates going up to $40 billion. Gonna take a wild guess and assume that last estimate comes from a guy with some skin in the game here. [Bloomberg]

According to new FBI statistics, hate crimes in the U.S. rose by 6.8 percent last year, with attacks against Muslims increasing by 67 percent. [Quartz]

69 percent
Percentage of South Africans who agree that jobs go only to “people with connections” and that that’s “a very important reason” why many other people in South Africa don’t have jobs. That figure was similarly high in other major African nations: 63 percent in Nigeria and 64 percent in Kenya. [Pew Research Center]

659 asteroids
Number of asteroids listed by the NASA Center for Near-Earth Object Studies as having some chance of hitting Earth. If it’s any consolation, the organizers of an event called “Asteroid Day” maintain that there are 1 million asteroids that could potentially strike the planet, and that we have only found a very, very small portion of them. [The New York Times]

100,000 beavers
… are doomed to die at the hands of the Argentine government. They were released into the province of Tierra del Fuego to spur the fur trade, but the beavers began reproducing and — with no natural predators — got out of hand. Argentina plans to eradicate the entire population. [BBC]

600,000 people
Over 600,000 people are directly employed in jobs related to alternative energy in the U.S., with a further 1.9 million employed in the energy efficiency industry. [FiveThirtyEight]

412 million accounts
Friend Finder Networks, which owns Cams.com, Penthouse, Stripshow, iCams and Adult Friend Finder, has been hacked. (I assume those sites are related to, respectively, climbing equipment, real estate, Broadway plays based on Sunday morning newspaper comics, Apple-compatible climbing equipment and finding acquaintances in adulthood.) More than 412 million accounts have reportedly been exposed. [The Guardian]
