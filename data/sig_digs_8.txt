36th president
John Bailey, a cinematographer who worked on “The Big Chill” and “American Gigolo,” was voted to become the 36th president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Oscars. [Variety]

53 percent
Percent of owner-occupied homes owned by people 55 and older. Baby boomers are holding on to their homes longer and are crowding out others from the market, namely younger Americans trying to own their first property. That figure was only 43 percent a decade ago. Certainly nothing could go wrong in an intergenerational housing fight where one side is holding out for a ridiculously expensive cash-out that the other side can likely never offer. [Bloomberg]

84 percent drop
Chinese capital buying up offshore real estate has been a financial trend in major world cities since 2013. But it’s projected to crash this year. Due to a stronger yuan and domestic initiatives that need funding, Morgan Stanley estimates an 84 percent drop in Chinese overseas direct property investments. [Bloomberg Gadfly]

109 cases
A salmonella outbreak traced back to a southern Mexico papaya farm has sickened at least 109 people in 16 states. [ABC News]

785 touchdowns
Number of touchdown passes last year that were thrown from the right arm of a passer. For a little context, last year there were … 786 total touchdown passes. The left-handed TD pass was on a trick play. This dearth of lefty passers is weird. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.021 trillion
Current outstanding revolving debt in the U.S., which you can basically think of as “credit card debt” for all intents and purposes. This is a new record, beating out $1.02 trillion in April 2008. Around that time nothing whatsoever notable occurred in the economy, as far as I can recall. [MarketWatch]

10 weeks
Monday night Rachel Lindsay of The Bachelorette arrived at the end of her 10-week journey and selected Bryan Abasolo as the winner of the competition. Abasolo was also the recipient of the show’s prized first impression rose; 17 percent of those who had received it in past seasons went on to win the competition. Abasolo’s victory only improves that rose’s predictive power. [FiveThirtyEight]

36 percent
Percentage of respondents to a CNN/SSRS poll who said they consider the first 200 days of President Trump’s presidency a success. Fifty-nine percent considered the first 200 days a failure. The first 200 days of President George W. Bush and President Obama saw success assessments of 56 percent and 51 percent, respectively. [CNN]

52 seats
Republicans do not need to win any swing states in order to achieve a Senate majority, given that there are 52 Senate seats in states where they beat the national presidential vote by a margin of five points or more. This imbalanced landscape is a recent phenomenon. In 1980, there were 18 states where the presidential margin was 5 points or more in favor of Democrats, and 18 states where it was 5 points or more in favor of Republicans. [FiveThirtyEight]

76 percent
76 percent of SAG-AFTRA members who voted on a new labor contract supported a new deal that gives actors improved residuals on digital streaming platform products. [Variety]

$489 million
It appears financial crime enforcement is down, judging by fines assessed. The Wall Street Journal looked at the aggregate penalties laid down by the SEC, CFTC and FIRA in the first half of 2017 and the amount — $489 million — is down substantially from last year, when $1.4 billion in fines were assessed in the same period.

9 applications
There have been at least nine applications for trademarks incorporating racially charged words and symbols filed since a June 19 Supreme Court ruling that tossed out a federal law prohibiting them. Most of those are related to the N-word. [Reuters]

36.2 days
Median amount of time a U.S. state could run government operations with their 2016 levels of money reserves. This is down from 2007’s mark of 41.3 days, and 2017 could see the median decline to 27.5 days of rainy-day fund runway. [Pew Charitable Trusts]

$37 in gross profit
Middlemen called pharmacy-benefit managers hugely profit from the sale of brand name drugs. According to a consulting group, a brand-name drug with a $300 list price may deliver $37 to third parties, with pharmacy-benefit managers getting $18 of it. [The Wall Street Journal]

32,000
The subways in New York City are in a state of dire disrepair after decades of governors ignored or deferred maintenance on the system. Now mayor Bill de Blasio is suggesting the city increase the upper-most tax rate by about a half-point to generate $800 million a year to fix the subways. There are about 32,000 New Yorkers who are either single individuals who make more than $500,000 per year or part of a married couple who make more than $1,000,000 annually. Their city tax rate would go from 3.9 percent to 4.4 percent. [Bloomberg]

$10 million
Just when he was finally getting out, Jay Cutler keeps being pulled back into the NFL. With the Dolphins confronting the loss of their starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill to knee surgery, the ex-Bears quarterback and recent Fox Sports hire signed a $10 million one-year deal with Miami. [ESPN]

184 million
Number of farms in China with cropland, compared to 1.6 million in the United States. That abundance of small suppliers means that China is particularly vulnerable to food fraud, for instance when lower-quality meats are passed off as the real deal. This has led to some serious tech solutions to confront the problem. [Bloomberg]

1 giant airplane
Boeing took a new set of test engines out for a spin on Wednesday night and — needing 18 hours of time in the air to test the engines’ endurance — set about tracing the outline of a 787 Dreamliner. The tip of the outlined plane is in Wyoming; its tail is in Alabama. [CNN Money]

I analyzed over 1,000 fortune cookies because I have completely lost control of my life. And most of them aren’t even fortunes! Just 22.3 percent of the unique messages I cracked open said anything about the future. Mostly they just talk about you, the reader, and how great you are. [FiveThirtyEight]

4.1 percent
The share of Americans moving across county and state lines to pursue work has plummeted. In rural areas, for example, 4.1 percent of people moved across a county line in 2015. The rate was 7.7 percent in the late 1970s. [The Wall Street Journal]

65 – 68 degrees
Nighttime thermostat wars? It happens to the best of us. At first, it’s civil. Then it escalates. Before you know it, you’re digging through the drawer looking for duct tape to lock that temperature in place. So let’s settle this now: Room temps between 65 and 68 degrees are best for sleep. Match those temperature settings with a mattress that keeps you cool and you’ll be well on your way to getting some high quality Z’s. Sponsored by Casper

6 percent
Kraft Heinz, now managed by the renowned cost-cutters at 3G Capital, is trying to reinvent its Oscar Meyer hot dogs for a more health-conscious consumer. The reinvention might bring a 6 percent sales jump, according to the company’s market research, and they’re spending $10 million to build the new hot dogs. [Bloomberg]

36.5 opioid deaths
A new study is casting doubt on previous research suggesting that rising mortality rates among middle-aged white men is largely attributable to “deaths of despair.” Rather, the new study in the International Journal of Epidemiology suggests that metabolic diseases such as obesity and opioid addiction (which has seen drug related deaths jump from 1.4 deaths per 100,000 men in 1980 to 36.5 deaths per 100,000 men in 2014) are among the key factors. [Medical Xpress]

China’s smartphone users aren’t as drawn to Apple’s iPhone as their American counterparts. One reason why: the dominance of WeChat, a messaging app that also includes bill pay, gaming and video streaming. All told, 35 percent of the total time China’s smartphone users spend on mobile apps each month is spent in WeChat, a self-contained environment that Apple can’t add to. [The Wall Street Journal]

$5.5 million
Pret A Manger, a sandwich shop with chains in several East Coast cities including New York, was hit with a $5.5 million class action lawsuit on Monday. Yee Ting Lau, a Pret A Manger customer, argues in the lawsuit that the company misleads its customers as to the real size of its sandwiches. As Gothamist wrote, “The shroud of deception, according to the suit, is a seemingly harmless cardboard casing — ‘lovingly handmade throughout the day,’ it reads — positioned in a way that obscures the actual size of the packaged wrap.” As a man whose primary motivations in life are “hunger” and “pettiness,” this is essentially the most important legal case of my lifetime.

75 calls

1987
That’s the year construction got started on the still incomplete Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea. The impressive and potentially structurally unstable 105-story building in the North Korean capital was unveiled with new renovations last week. The structure was also sporting a new sign: “Rocket Power Nation.” Perhaps Kim Jong Un’s regime has finally caught on to “Rocket Power,” the hit Nickelodeon action-games cartoon that inspired a generation of extreme sports lovers. Or, more likely, he’s happy with those ballistic missile tests. [Bloomberg]

ExxonMobil’s request to lessen a $19.95 million fine has gone unheeded by a federal judge. An ExxonMobil complex in the Houston area was found to have exceeded air pollution limits from 2005 to 2013 by 10 million pounds. [The Texas Tribune]

A majority of American adults — 58 percent according to a Reuter/Ipsos survey — said that transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. But there is a partisan split: While most Democrats support transgender service, only 32 percent of Republicans do. [NBC News]

189 days
We learned on Friday that Reince Priebus had resigned as President Trump’s chief of staff. Priebus’s 189-day tenure was the shortest ever for a chief of staff not serving on an interim basis or departing because the president’s term was up. [PBS, FiveThirtyEight]

$25.6 million
Box office gross for Sony’s “The Emoji Movie” in its debut weekend — a disappointment that landed the film behind “Dunkirk” in its second weekend. But hey, at least Sony can cash in by merchandising the public-domain world of unicode characters. You can ride that 💰 🐄 into the sunset. Sometimes it’s still shocking to me how vestigial a movie itself can be and yet still have lots of ways of making money. [The Numbers]

$20.54 billion
Netflix is rapidly trying to build up the kind of enduring catalog of content that can yield dividends for years to come. But to get there, the streaming service is borrowing lots of money — to develop its own original content and to pay for the back catalogs that other people built. As a result, the company has racked up an immense amount of debt, some $4.8 billion in long-term debt and $15.7 billion in short-term obligations. There’s nothing inherently bad about this — subscribers are consistently up and Netflix has to spend money to make money — but there’s the potential that the debt becomes a monkey on the company’s back if the business climate changes.

Three Republicans — Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona — joined 48 Democrats to vote against a third and seemingly final (for now) attempt to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate. The 51-49 early morning vote, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s subsequent remarks, mean that for now the Affordable Care Act appears unscathed despite complete GOP control of the federal government. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of times the premiere of “Game of Thrones” was pirated in the U.S. last week, according to a company that sells anti-piracy tech.
