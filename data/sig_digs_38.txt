Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

10 percent
The TSA has some serious issues going into the heavy summer travel months, with lines building and passengers getting steamed. One source of the problem: Since 2013 the airport security agency’s employee base has dropped by 10 percent while travel is up 12 percent over the same period. [The Takeaway]

12 percent
Venezuela is suffering through a food shortage, and a study last month found that 12 percent of polled Venezuelans reported they were having fewer than three meals per day. [The Guardian]

25 percent
A U.K. study looking at the effect the end of a marriage has on diet found that men who divorced, separated, or were widowed cut their consumption of fruits and vegetables by 25 percent compared to men who stayed married. [The Wall Street Journal]

32.1 percent
According to the Pew Research Center, 32.1 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 live in their parents’ home, which is higher than the 31.6 percent in that age group who live with a spouse or are cohabiting. It’s the first time in more than a century that more young Americans live with their parents than a partner. [NPR]

$300 million
Volkswagen has invested $300 million into Israeli taxi-ordering app Gett. The investment is reminiscent of General Motor’s $500 million investment in Lyft, another ride hailing app. [Bloomberg]

$139 billion
The E.U. has given the go-ahead for Anheuser-Busch InBev to acquire SABMiller, a competitor, provided AB InBev sells off most of SABMiller’s beer business on the continent. Europeans spend about $139 billion on beer every year, so regulators are worried the consolidation could lead to a price hike. [Reuters]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

14th-worst defeat
The NBA’s Western Conference finals have been turned upside down by Sunday’s Golden State Warriors loss to the Oklahoma Thunder in Game 3 of the series. The 28-point loss was the 14th-worst ever for a top-seeded team in the playoffs, judging by point margin. That the Warriors were supposed to be a historically-great top seed made it even more shocking. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 counties
Half of the growth in new business creation during the economic recovery has happened in a mere 20 counties in the U.S., according to a study from Economic Innovation Group, a research and advocacy group founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sean Parker. [The Washington Post]

55.3 percent
According to a 2014 study, that’s the percentage of psychiatrists who take private insurance, compared to the 88.7 percent average for all health care professionals. The reasons for this are complex, but the gist is that since so many in the field work solo, and insurance companies haven’t upped the compensation rate in years, it can make more sense to ask patients to pay cash a lot of the time. [Quartz]

$80.17
In addition to a one-game suspension, Dahntay Jones of the Cleveland Cavaliers owes a fine of $80.17 for punching Toronto Raptors center Bismack Biyombo in the groin during Game 3. Teammate LeBron James, presumably after ruffling through his couch cushions for a few lost twenties, said he will cover the fine. [ESPN, h/t @JoeyCasavecchia]

89.9 percent
Percentage of Spotify revenues derived from paid subscriptions in 2015, with the rest coming from users playing ads on the free advertisement-supported tier. This means that the vast majority of Spotify’s $2.18 billion in 2015 revenue came from the 31 percent of its users who were paid subscribers. [Quartz]

13,317,980 visitors
Number of visitors this past 2015-16 season to Broadway, up 1.6 percent over the previous season. Also, another fun digit in the data: 478,605. That is the precise number of people I now know I envy, because they have seen “Hamilton” on Broadway and I have not. [The New York Times]

2 shows
Maroon 5 canceled two shows in North Carolina — one in Charlotte and another in Raleigh — over a new state law forcing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their birth gender. [CNN]

About 10 minutes
The White House went into lockdown Sunday for about 10 minutes over what turned out to be misplaced party balloons. [Bloomberg]

19 states
Some think that Donald Trump’s polls are undercounting his support, since voters may be hesitant to tell a stranger they support Trump. But the evidence doesn’t suggest that’s the case. Donald Trump has underperformed his polling forecast in 19 states so far in the Republican primary, compared to 15 states where he overperformed his polling. The median state saw Trump underperform his polls by 1.1 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

157 women
Number of pregnant women in the United States who have tested positive for the Zika virus as of the end of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A further 122 pregnant women in U.S. territories have tested positive. [Reuters]

$39 million
“The Angry Birds Movie” took in $39 million domestically in its first weekend in theaters. That means that, yes, “The Angry Birds Movie” somehow became the top grossing film at the box office for at least one weekend in America. On balance, I think we deserve this election. [USA Today]

$504 billion
Total cash and non-cash equivalent holdings of Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Alphabet (the parent company of Google), combined. U.S. non-financial companies have $1.7 trillion in cash, meaning that five companies control 30 percent of the dough. [USA Today]

2 identical testimonies
Two expert witnesses submitted identical testimony to a House subcommittee hearing on an Obama administration proposal aimed at reducing prescription drug costs. The two witnesses belong to separate interest groups that both oppose the administration’s proposal but that happen to be represented by the same a lobbying firm. [The Huffington Post]

8 a.m.
Listen, we try to avoid New York naval-gazing here in Significant Digits, but this story is just so personally consequential that I can’t leave it out. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed legislation that would allow alcohol to be sold in bars and restaurants before noon on Sundays. The current setup really cramps my brunch game. The proposal would permit restaurants to start serving liquor at 8 a.m. That would be a huge win: Once Sunday matches the rest of the week, there will be only four hours each day, from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m., that I cannot be holed up in a bar. [New York Daily News]

52.9 percent
Probability that a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals will be able to redeem a Papa John’s pizza discount after any given game (all it takes is a Cardinals win). That’s thanks to the close promotional relationship Major League Baseball has formed with Papa John’s. Still, Atlanta Braves fans aren’t so lucky; they follow a team with a mere 7.7 percent chance of getting six runs in a game, the trigger for the Papa John’s discount there. The New York Yankees are using the same promotion as Atlanta, but a Yankees fan has a 14.4 percent chance to win the discount each game — of course, presumably they have enough self-respect as New Yorkers not to eat Papa John’s pizza. [FiveThirtyEight]

75 stores
The Gap will close roughly 75 Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, mainly retail shops overseas. Sales fell 6 percent in the first quarter compared to last year. [The Washington Post]

107 hours
That’s how long Portugal ran its electricity system with renewable energy — solar, wind and hydroelectric, exclusively— last week. That’s more than four days. [The Guardian]

511 million pre-cut apples
Want your kids to eat more apples? Just cut them up. A new study found that the share of kids who ate at least half an apple as part of their school lunch was “70 percent higher at schools that served sliced apples.” Americans generally — not just school kids — consumed 511 million pre-cut apples in 2014, a new high.

11 potential Supreme Court picks
Donald Trump released a list of 11 judges that he would consider to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. All 11 are white, and eight are men, but Trump’s potential nominees are unconventional for the Supreme Court in other ways — none went to Harvard Law School, for instance. [FiveThirtyEight]

16 percent
Falling oil prices have caused a massive downturn in North Dakota, which had been riding an energy boom. The downturn has affected virtually every corner of life and economic activity in the state. An exotic dancer, for example, told Reuters that her tips are down 60 percent since last year. Live births at St. Alexius Medical Center are projected to dip. Industrial real estate prices are cratering. And the syphilis transmission rate fell 16 percent in 2015 from its peak the year before. [Reuters]

57.9 percent
Percentage of voters in Clinton County, Kentucky, that supported Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. This is not an important county in the overall battle for the Democratic nomination; it doesn’t tell us anything about national voting trends. But the victory is a moral one for Clinton: Bernie Sanders had won all eight of the other counties named Clinton to vote so far, in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. [The Hill]

70 percent
That’s the average percentage of IMDb user ratings on television programs with 1,000 or more votes that are from men, san imbalance that has led to a significant skew in how shows favored by women and shows favored by men are rated overall by users. Namely, male reviewers on IMDb hate on television aimed at women. [FiveThirtyEight]

4.2 million workers
The Obama administration announced new rules on Wednesday that doubled the salary threshold, from $23,660 to $47,476, under which workers are guaranteed overtime pay. An additional 4.2 million workers will benefit from the change, according to an estimate from the Department of Labor. [The Washington Post]

117 million LinkedIn logins
A hacker is attempting to sell the email addresses and passwords of 117 million LinkedIn members. [TechCrunch]

1 superdelegate
Bernie Sanders, who trails Hillary Clinton in pledged delegates and superdelegates, is trying to woo Clinton’s superdelegates to switch sides. He faced a setback, though, when one of his superdelegates — Emmett Hansen II of the U.S. Virgin Islands — announced that he will now back Clinton. [Bloomberg]

3 pounds of cheese
There’s a surplus of cheese in the United States. High prices and a hot export market sent production soaring, but then a strengthening dollar put off foreign buyers and prices sank. At current cheese levels, Americans would need to increase their consumption this year by 3 pounds each to eat the surplus away. This is the best news I have ever heard in my entire life, and I plan to do my part. [The Wall Street Journal]

More than 8 metric tons of cocaine
That’s the amount of cocaine seized by Colombian authorities last weekend at a banana farm. That’s more than 17,500 pounds, or roughly the weight of … you know what, I’m not going to even compare it to some really heavy thing; all you have to know is that it is a crapload of cocaine. [CNN]

30 percent
According to a University of Michigan Medical School survey of high-achieving doctors, that’s the percentage of women who said they have been sexually harassed during their careers. [Newsweek]

62 years
That’s how long it’s been since the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, declared segregated schools unconstitutional. But just this week, a judge ordered the Cleveland school district in Mississippi to desegregate. A plaintiff in the case — now 57 years old — was in fourth grade when the case was brought in 1965. [NPR]

335-to-1
Based on a new report from the AFL-CIO federation of unions, the average CEO of a company on the S&P 500 made 335 times as much money as the average production and non-supervisory worker in 2015. That’s down from 373 times as much money as 2014. Hooray? [Reuters]

1 person
The world’s oldest person, Susannah Mushatt Jones, died Thursday at 116. Now, Earth has only one known human inhabitant born in the 1800s, Emma Morano of Italy. Morano was “born about a month before 1900 began.” [USA Today]

$2
Cost of a bottomless soda at the Atlanta Falcons’ Mercedes-Benz Stadium when it opens next year, just one part of a new concessions menu that will be the cheapest of any major sports team. Atlanta has evidently been struggling to sell tickets to its new stadium, so a 12-ounce Bud Light for $5 may be one solution. [ESPN]

More than 650 counties
At least 650 U.S. counties will likely have only one insurer available on the Obamacare exchanges in 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, up from 225 in 2016. About 70 percent of those counties are primarily rural. [The Wall Street Journal]

253,000 comics
Number of issues of Black Panther #1, newly relaunched with acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, sold so far this year, making it the best-selling comic book issue of 2016 so far. [Comichron]

More than $350 million
According to the Government Accountability Office, Department of Defense space launches from the United Launch Alliance (ULA) — a collaboration between Boeing and Lockheed Martin — cost more than $350 million each, compared with the less than $100 million per launch cost SpaceX has promised. Politico reported: “Even the Pentagon’s acquisition chief grants that the creation of ULA — a monopoly criticized by the Federal Trade Commission when it was formed at the government’s behest a decade ago — may have been a mistake.” [POLITICO]

$888 million
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested big in Apple in the first quarter of this year, scooping up more than 9.8 million shares. That investment was worth roughly $1.1 billion, but it’s worth only about $888 million now because of declines in Apple’s share price. [CNN Money]

2 kilometers
Last year, Milan, Italy, set the world record for longest pizza at just over 1.5 kilometers, and Naples is hella mad. Chefs in Naples have prepped to make a 2 kilometer pizza containing some two tons of mozzarella (for U.S. residents unfamiliar with the metric system, a kilometer is basically a mile that phoned it in). [NPR]

7-6
That was the score of a baseball game played on Sunday between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays. (The Rangers won.) But that scoreline barely scratches the surface of what went down. There were ejections galore, the best punch I’ve ever seen televised and a bench-clearing brawl. You know, basically a boring hockey game. [ESPN]

18.9 percent
Percentage of Americans aged 65 and older who are working, the highest level in decades. [Bloomberg]

More than 4,000 complaints
Las Vegas was hit hard by the Great Recession and the collapse of the housing market. To this day, it is contending with the consequences, including squatters. In 2015, there were more than 4,000 complaints to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department about squatters, up 43 percent compared to 2014. [The New York Times]

50 or more employees
The lower house of the French parliament passed a bill that would make it illegal for companies with 50 or more employees to send emails outside of work hours — namely, after work and on the weekend. [The Washington Post]

38,000 slots
The gaokao is China’s college entrance exam. It is basically the SAT on steroids, the kind of thing kids spend their lives preparing for. So the announcement that 38,000 slots at universities in the wealthy Jiangsu province will be saved for applicants from other, often poorer areas did not go over well. There were demonstrations in multiple cities. “In the provincial capital, Nanjing,” The Wall Street Journal wrote, “parents gathered outside of provincial offices Saturday, shouting, ‘Governor, come out!’ as riot police kept them at bay.” [The Wall Street Journal]

Nearly 40 percent
It appears that psychologists are just as susceptible to psychological tricks as the rest of us: After the Center for Open Science announced that it would award badges to scientific papers that used transparent methods and shared their data, the percentage of such papers appearing in the journal Psychological Science jumped tenfold to nearly 40 percent of papers published. You get a gold star, Center for Open Science. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of times Lhakpa Sherpa has climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, the most of any woman on Earth. She’s now working on her seventh summit, but has remained somewhat anonymous despite her achievements. [Outside Online]

9-5
Vladimir Putin played a pickup game of hockey against some amateurs and basically wiped the ice with them: His team — which, sure, may have had a few former players on it — won 9-5. (What I would give to hear Putin’s attempts at chirping.) The big story of the game, though, is that Putin totally ate it at one point and a photographer got a picture of his fall into The Guardian. [The Guardian]

24 speeches
With 22 commencements addresses in the bank and two more to come this year at Rutgers University and the Air Force Academy, that’s the total number of graduation speeches President Obama will have given while in office. Obama’s rate of three speeches per year is about par for presidents since the speech-heavy years of George H.W. Bush, who gave 23 commencement addresses in just four years as president! [FiveThirtyEight]

518 votes
Number of votes obtained by the presidential ticket of the Prohibition Party in the 2012 election, down from 270,000 votes in the halcyon days of 1892. This year, the party hopes to get on the ballot in six states, up from just one state in 2012. [The Guardian]
