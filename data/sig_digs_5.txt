2 holdouts
With Nicaragua reportedly set to join the Paris climate accords — they held out in 2015 because the nation believed the deal didn’t go far enough — there are now only two holdouts from the landmark deal: Syria and the United States, which President Trump said would pull out of the agreement. [Bloomberg]

AB 485
A California bill awaiting the signature of Gov. Jerry Brown would outlaw puppy mills, banning pet stores from selling cats, dogs and bunnies that did not come from a shelter or rescue. [The New York Times]

1,772 episodes
This is easily the most staggering statistic I have come across while writing this column: There have been 1,772 individual episodes of HGTV’s “House Hunters” since it debuted in 1999. I could watch an episode of “House Hunters” every day for nearly five years without seeing a single repeat. When we’re just a radioactive cinder in the gaze of an expanding sun, whomever or whatever succeeds us will be able to say, “damn … they were good at finding and obtaining houses.” [Vulture]

80,000 311 calls
Hurricane Sandy left an indelible mark on New York City, and the effects of the storm can still be seen and felt years later. More than 36 million calls were placed to NYC’s 311 service from just before Sandy hit in late 2012 through earlier this week. Nearly 80,000 of them were related to the storm. And the tail is super long — 142 such calls were made in 2017 (as of Monday). [FiveThirtyEight]

3.5 million people
Hurricane Maria has left the entire island of Puerto Rico and its 3.5 million residents without power. That’s to say nothing of flooding and other destruction. Maria, now a Category 3 storm, is currently hitting the Dominican Republic. [BBC]

$31.4 million
Russian trade with North Korea more doubled to $31.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Reuters found eight North Korean fuel ships that left Russia ostensibly en route to China or South Korea only to change their final destination to North Korea. [Reuters]

8.1 percent
A storied Boston-area financial institution announced “disappointing” profit numbers for the latest fiscal year, with the $37.1 billion fund pulling in only an 8.1 percent return. (For perspective, the S&P 500 posted about a 13 percent return for the last year.) This comes months after the financial firm, which uses the proceeds from its ample endowments to sponsor a local university named “Harvard,” announced layoffs and more investment outsourcing. [FastFT]

$18,764
Average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health insurance coverage, according to the 2017 edition of the Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employee health benefits. Workers paid, on average, $5,714 of that. Premiums were up 3 percent compared to 2016. [Kaiser Family Foundation]

$231,250
The Republican National Committee is helping to pay President Trump’s legal bills in relation to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the potential involvement of Trump associates. The RNC confirmed that it paid $100,000 to Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, and $131,250 to the Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, where another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is a partner. [Reuters]

299,649 Twitter accounts
Number of user accounts Twitter removed in the first half of 2017 for “promotion of terrorism.” While high, that’s still down 20 percent from the previous six months. [Reuters]

$60 million
Patreon, the site that lets fans set up recurring payments to independent creators, just closed a $60 million funding round. [Variety]

$45 billion
The GOP’s earlier attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act carried with it $45 billion in additional funding to help with opioid addiction treatment. The money was meant to compensate for cuts the repeal bill made to Medicaid. But the latest GOP effort to repeal Obamacare, Graham-Cassidy, doesn’t contain funding to combat the opioid epidemic. It’s not clear why some Republican senators were demanding the funding before but not now. [The Daily Beast]

14 quarterbacks
Colin Kaepernick is a historical anomaly. There have been only 14 other quarterbacks who were (i) not yet 30, (ii) had thrown 200 passes or more in a season and (iii) never played again. And everyone in that group had football-related reasons they never took another snap — career ending injuries, substance abuse issues, got signed but never left the bench — rather than politics. [ESPN]

16 investigators
There are now 16 lawyers known to be working on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Kyle Freeny is No. 16. She left a high-profile money laundering case at the Department of Justice to join Team Mueller. [POLITICO]

-18 percentage points
President Trump’s job approval rating is down by 18 percentage points, on average, compared to his margin of victory in states he won by 10 or more points in 2016. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.8 million
Equifax’s share price has dropped 35 percent since the company announced a security breach that exposed data on 143 million Americans. Before the breach was publicly announced (and after it was discovered), three Equifax executives sold $1.8 million worth of stock. Now the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into whether the executives broke insider trading laws. [Bloomberg]

$60 million
Amount “It,” the movie adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, made last weekend. That would have been the best-ever September weekend at the domestic box office — except for the fact that it was the second weekend in cinemas for “It.” The movie notched a record-smashing $123 million opening the week before. So “It” now has the best weekend in September, the second best weekend in September, and then previous record-holder “Hotel Transylvania 2” is down in third place. [The Numbers]

$2.3 billion
Ballpark cost for the M7, a luxury submarine. Yes, rich people can totally buy submarines. No, I didn’t think that was legal either, but it’s legit. The M7 comes in at the shall-we-say high end of the luxury submarine market, as in “the most expensive private object worldwide” high-end. Too pricy? If you want something classier then a James-Cameron-class submersible but short of the M7, other sizable subs may soon be on sale that will appeal to the more price-conscious Nemo-wannabe in your life.

8 Emmys
Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her eighth primetime acting Emmy award on Sunday night, which ties the career record set by Cloris Leachman. Besides “Veep,” the other big winners last night included “Saturday Night Live,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Big Little Lies.” [The New York Times]

18 percent
Obesity rate in Brazil in 2015, up from 7 percent in 1980. One effect of globalization is that the same processed foods, sugary drinks and poor nutrition habits that made America obese have now been efficiently exported to the rest of the world. [The New York Times]

22 floods
The federal flood insurance program has paid more than $1.8 million between 1979 and 2015 to rebuild a single house in Kingwood, Texas. The house has been flooded 22 times since 1979, but Hurricane Harvey was the last straw — the homeowner wants out. [The Wall Street Journal]

10,000 snaps
Congratulations to Joe Thomas of the Cleveland Browns, who on Sunday played his 10,000th consecutive snap since being drafted in 2007. The left tackle has never missed a play in an NFL game. [ESPN]

10,046 runners
Of the 28,206 runners who officially crossed the finish line in the Mexico City Marathon, 10,046 missed at least one of the eight timing mats around the course. (Nearly 300 missed all eight!) Widespread evidence of runners skipping portions of the course and other shenanigans has led to the disqualification of more than 5,800 people, which is legitimately absurd. [Runner’s World]

$25 million
Amount reportedly spent on President Trump’s pre-inauguration Lincoln Memorial concert — a tad more than the $5 million spent on Obama’s inauguration concert or the $2.5 million spent on George W. Bush’s. Toby Keith and Three Doors Down must be pricy. [Associated Press]

85 percent
An abnormally warm winter caused the loss of 85 percent of Georgia’s peach crop. As world temperatures rise due to climate change, crops all over — whether it’s apples in Michigan or cherries in California — are at risk of loss due to premature blooms or dry winters. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,800 people
The entire island of Barbuda was evacuated ahead of Hurricane Irma, meaning the 62 square mile home of about 1,800 people is empty. It’s infrastructure has also been decimated by the storm, with about 95 percent of its structures sustaining damage. [USA Today]

3,948
Later today we’re going to hurl a satellite into Saturn. The Cassini-Huygens mission has been a major success, resulting in 3,948 scientific papers, 453,048 images taken, and six named moons discovered. You have any idea how hard it is to find a moon nobody else noticed? Yeah well Cassini did that like six times. Now it gets to be part of Saturn, which is pretty neat all things considered. [NASA]

700 million
New air conditioning units expected to be added by 2030, largely in developing countries. One issue yet to be solved is that additional air conditioning units are positively terrible for the environment, given that the hydroflourocarbons that they use as refrigerants have thousands of times the warming potential of more common greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. [The Verge]

$4.4 billion
Immigrating to the U.S. isn’t easy, but the rich have a leg up: The EB-5 visa allows investors to eventually obtain a green card with a $500,000 minimum investment in the U.S. In 2015, the value of those loans was $4.4 billion, up from $240 million in 2007, with 74 percent of that investment going to real estate. The great recession made foreign EB-5 related financing ideal for many real estate developers: They get a way better interest rate than commercial alternatives — 4 to 8 percent annually compared to 10 to 18 percent annually — because the actual ROI for the lender is a green card. [Bloomberg]

$58 billion
That’s the current estimate for the aggregate costs of Hurricane Irma in Florida, with a further $30 billion in damage to Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean. It’s important that Irma struck Marco Island rather than passing it 20 miles to the west, as the storm could have hit mainland Florida at a far more advanced strength and could have caused an additional $150 billion in damage to the state.

32 inches
Imagine a person on an airplane bracing for impact and assuming the position where their head is between their legs. Department of Transportation documentation indicates there has to be a 35 inch axis from the bottom of the seat back in order to have a clear head strike zone. According to a court briefing, the most generous axis in coach seats right now is 32 inches after years of cramming more seats on to planes, meaning no seat meets the standard in coach. [The Daily Beast]

44 minutes
Time spent on advertisements during the Raiders-Titans game on Sunday, a low for the weekend. Looking at the NFL opening weekend games in the aggregate, games had about 10 fewer minutes of commercials compared to last year. [Sports Facts]

46 percent
Percentage of NFL offenses that gained fewer than 300 yards in week one, up from 22 percent of offenses in the previous three season openers. This may underscore a league-wide problem developing offensive line talent. [The Washington Post]

$5,000
Martin Shkreli, the widely reviled pharmaceutical representative convinced of fraud, has had his $5 million bail revoked after he used his pre-sentencing time as a free man to put up a $5,000 bounty for one of his fans to grab former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s hair. This was considered bad behavior by the judge. [CNBC]

$25,000 per hour
Hourly cost of the U.S. Air Force jet that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, independently wealthy from his time at Goldman Sachs, asked the government to use to fly him to his honeymoon in Scotland, France and Italy. The request to have the taxpayers fund the vacation was declined. [ABC News]

$500,000
Minimum amount that Equifax spent on lobbying Congress and regulators in the first half of 2017, including pursuing legislation that would limit the liability of credit reporting companies in the courts. Given that Equifax oversaw the personal financial data of 143 million Americans that was hacked in a cyberattack, that sure would be a useful law to have on the books so they wouldn’t have to pay victims all that much.

Number of Week 1 NFL games decided by 7 points or fewer, the worst for any season-opener since 1973. It was a week seriously short on riveting games, but let’s be real: All you people who took a fantasy football flyer on Kareem Hunt because I mentioned him this past week must be pretty cool with your subscription to Significant Digits right now. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 hours
Hillary Clinton’s new book, “What Happened,” is out, and it’s entering the wildly varied political memoir market. Based on how long the average person actually listened to the audiobook, George W. Bush’s 20.2 hour-long “Decision Points” is the most stuck-with tome in the genre at 12.0 hours, beating Clinton’s own “Hard Choices,” which the average listener tuned into for 8.4 hours out of 27 hours in the book. [FiveThirtyEight]

25
Vitamin World filed for Chapter 11 relief on Monday, making it the 25th retail chain with over $10 million in liabilities to do so in 2017. [Reorg First Day]

38 percent
A survey of a panel of economists by the Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets found 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the rising use of A.I. and robots will lead to more long-term unemployment, compared with 21 percent who disagree and 29 percent who were uncertain. Those same economists agreed — 52 percent, and another 26 percent strongly agreeing on top of that — that the use of robots and A.I. will bring about economic benefits large enough to compensate those unemployed workers.

130 tons
Estimated weight of a fatberg — if you’re new to sewers, I’ll explain in a moment — stretching for 250 meters underneath London. Here’s the reality: When you pour things down the drain, they go through a convoluted series of pipes underground. Sometimes people pour down liquid fat that they cooked with, not understanding that oil will solidify long before reaching its final destination. Other people flush wet napkins down the toilet that do not disintegrate but instead form a horrifying solid paste with the aforementioned fats. Over the years, these aggregate into fatbergs — an amalgamation of fat with similar blocking effects of an iceberg — and take like three weeks to remove, as is anticipated in this case. [The Guardian]

22,000
Once again, Olive Garden is selling pasta passes, which will allow cardholders to eat unlimited pasta, soup, salad and breadsticks at locations from Sept. 25 through Nov. 19 at no additional charge. The passes cost $100 this year in a first come, first served sale this Thursday at 2 p.m. Last year, Olive Garden sold 21,000 passes in one second. I picked the wrong month to quit eating carbs. [Business Insider]
CORRECTION (Sept. 13, 6:30 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly said Olive Garden sold 22,000 pasta passes last year. It sold 21,000.

11 percent
At the current pace, FBI National Instant Criminal Background Checks for firearm sales will be down 11 percent compared to last year. It’s an imperfect proxy, but across the industry the election of Donald Trump to the White House has suppressed the demand for weapons that usually accompanies even the slightest chance of gun reform. [Fortune]

25 percent
PETA made headlines recently when it bankrolled a lawsuit against a nature photographer, claiming that an Indonesian macaque monkey named Naruto owned the intellectual property rights on a selfie it had taken when it snagged the photographer’s camera in 2011. On Monday, PETA officially dropped the suit, but according to the terms of the settlement 25 percent of the gross revenue from the selfie will go to Naruto’s welfare and habitat. [Ars Technica]

39 square miles
Texas and other southern states are contending with a devastating invasive species annihilating bodies of water with overgrowth: giant salvinia. Australian researchers — a nation which itself is going toe-to-toe with the salvinia problem — found under ideal conditions even a pinch of salvinia plant can singlehandedly cover 39 square miles of water in 3 months. Locals have resorted to fighting the plant with its natural enemy, weevils. [Texas Monthly]

8.5 million barrels
The United Nations Security Council agreed to new sanctions against North Korea, limiting its imports of crude and refined oil to 8.5 million barrels a year and banning all exports of its textiles (worth $726 million last year), which now means about 90 percent of the North Korean exports are banned. [The Washington Post]

$2.2 billion
A recent report from Adobe’s digital price index found that if all offline retail spending was online, there would be an aggregate $2.2 billion savings for consumers. [Marketwatch]

$350 billion to $750 billion
Forthcoming investment in new lithium mines, as producers strive to keep up with explosive demand for the metal used in the rechargeable batteries that underpin the electric car market. Global electric vehicle sales are projected to exceed 24 million in just 13 years, up from 1 million in 2017. [Bloomberg]
CORRECTION (Sept. 19, 3:30 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described U.N. sanctions against North Korea. The sanctions allow North Korea to import up to 8.5 million barrels of crude and refined oil, not just crude.

2.7 million
Hurricane Irma is pummeling Florida, leaving about 2.7 million without power as of 5:30 p.m. yesterday. The storm is hitting Florida’s western coast where there are many assisted living facilities, many areas where a substantial percentage of people who live in mobile homes or below the poverty line, or where there are large concentrations of migrant workers. [ABC News, FiveThirtyEight]

8.1
Strength of an earthquake that hit about 60 miles off the coast of Mexico late Thursday, the largest in the region in decades. An estimated fifty million Mexicans felt the earthquake, and the death toll has risen to 91. [The Los Angeles Times, Reuters]

Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, has notified the White House he will potentially want to question six current and former officials who were possibly witnesses to the events in question: Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, Hope Hicks, Don McGahn, James Burnham and Josh Raffel. [The Washington Post]

72 percent
The U.S. Asian population is growing faster than any other U.S. racial or ethnic group, climbing 72 percent between 2000 and 2015 according to a new study from the Pew Research Center. Asians Americans are projected to eclipse Hispanic Americans in 2055 to become the largest immigrant group in the country. [Pew Research Center]

450,000 people
The Houston area is only just reckoning with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Still 70,000 people are without water and another 380,000 need to boil water because their supply may have been compromised. While many residents do not have flood insurance and will soon have to rebuild their homes, FEMA officials said they will contribute a maximum of $33,000 per home. [Reuters]

$97 million
The cost in U.S. dollars of a plebiscite vote in Australia on a non-binding resolution that would change the country’s marriage laws to include same-sex marriage. The cost is just one reason that some question the point of a national vote when it will not have any effect, and Parliament can easily vote on the subject without needed to spur up a divisive and marginalizing political campaign.

16 weeks
Taylor Swift, a local 🐍 and pop musician, prevented “Despacito” from breaking the record for the longest reign at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 list. Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do” is the new chart-topper, deposing Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber’s single. Lacking a record, they’ll have to settle for a tie with Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, whose “One Sweet Day” was a top song for 16 weeks. [CNN]

20 percent
A Princeton economic study suggests that opioid use is responsible for a fifth of the decline in men’s participation in the U.S. labor force. [Bloomberg]

77 percent
That’s the percentage of ratings on IMDb for the film “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power” that were either a 1 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10. It’s the most polarizing film of the year, and the fact that most of the votes trashing it came in before it even hit wide release is suspicious. [FiveThirtyEight]

25,000 vehicles
The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved legislation that forbids states from blocking self-driving cars and allows auto companies to put up to 25,000 automated vehicles on the road without meeting auto safety standards. [Reuters]

100,000 claims
Hurricane Irma-related insurance claims anticipated by the second-largest property insurer in Florida, Citizens Property Insurance Corp. For some perspective, Citizens only has 262,000 policyholders in areas that may see hurricane-force winds, so the damage from the major hurricane could be severe this coming weekend. [SunSentinel]

Number of Equifax customers that may have been the victims of a cyberattack. Keep in mind that even though you’re not paying Equifax, you might be a customer given that the credit reporting agency may very well have your personal details on file. Oh, one other thing, it appears three executives dumped a combined $1.8 million in Equifax stock three says after the company detected the inclusion and before everyone else knew about it.
