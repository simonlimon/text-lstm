2 in 1,000
A new analysis finds that tort lawsuits — the ones over civil wrongs that cause someone loss or harm, such as suits over medical malpractice and car accidents — are on the decline, with less than two out of every 1,000 Americans filing one in 2015, down from 10 in 1,000 Americans in 1993. [The Wall Street Journal]

70 percent
Back sleeper? Stomach sleeper? As it turns out, it’s usually something in between. 70 percent of people wind up sleeping on their side at some point during the night, regardless of the sleeping position they think they have. Whichever side you end up sleeping on, the right mattress is key for quality sleep. Something like this is what you want to be looking for. Sponsored by Casper

9 defections
A procedural vote that was a de facto vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act — the Senate GOP plan to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act — failed in the Senate when nine Republicans (Senators Susan Collins, Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Dean Heller, Mike Lee, Jerry Moran, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker and Tom Cotton) voted no. The motion, which needed 60 votes to pass, fell 43-57. [FiveThirtyEight]

31.9 percent
Share of state revenues that came from federal funds in fiscal year 2015. Looking at the 50 states together, that number has fluctuated between 26 and 36 percent since the turn of the century, with some years heavily affected by the 2008-09 recession. Still, some states come out very much ahead; Louisiana and Mississippi each get a little more than 42 percent of state revenue from the federal government, while states like North Dakota (18.4 percent), Virginia (21.5 percent) and Hawaii (22.8 percent) get far less.

$6,000 per year
Every summer, lots of New York City rich people go to the Hamptons on Long Island. They are obviously the target demographic for all sorts of ridiculous luxury products, and one way to get such products out there is through the seemingly endless free magazines that target the area’s summer residents. This has presented a legitimate issue for the cities: The sheer mass of magazines being disposed of has led to at least one sanitation worker injury. The basic cost of disposing of the magazines is approximately $6,000 per year for Southampton Village. [27 East]

1.7 million pounds of dirt
Two new vacuums operating in the New York City subway system have hauled out 1.7 million pounds of dirt and detritus from the E, F and A lines since the beginning of the year. Since the trash clean-up effort began, the number of trash fires dropped from 75 in January to 53 in June. [The New York Times]

$78.5 billion
Estimated cost of prescription opioid abuse in 2013, according to a federal study. That doesn’t incorporate costs of lost productivity experienced by employers who are having trouble staffing up, with some reporting that as many as a quarter of applicants can’t pass a drug test.

Cost of the Yara Birkeland, an autonomous electric ship under development and bound for the seas in 2018. That’s about three times the up-front cost of a standard ship of its size, but since it doesn’t need fuel or a crew, operating costs are as much as 90 percent lower than normal.

$72 billion
In a potentially huge break in the effort to decommission the reactor at the Fukushima site, Tokyo Electric Power Co. released images taken from a small robot that appears to have located melted nuclear fuel inside one of the wrecked rectors. Knowing the exact location and makeup of the radioactive fuel is key to devising a plan to remove it. The decades-long cleanup effort is projected to cost in the ballpark of $72 billion. [Bloomberg]

It’s summer, and how we use energy to cool our homes is of paramount interest to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. All told, 87 percent of homes use air conditioning, and 65 percent of homes use central air conditioning. Now here’s where things get interesting: Most of those central air homes have a programmable thermostat, an essential tool for efficiently using energy. Still, two-thirds of those homes with a programmable thermostat don’t bother using it. All told, the percentage of U.S. homes that have central air, have a thermostat that can program the use of that central air, and actually use the thermostat — ideal energy consumers — represent only 12 percent of homes. [EIA]

45 percent
Percentage of Trump voters who believed that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer during the election, which is very low given that Donald Trump Jr. personally tweeted out the emails detailing the planning of the meeting, discussed attending the meeting at length in an interview with Sean Hannity, and also that the president discussed the meeting which definitely happened, in print yesterday.

74 percent
Placebos work, and faking a surgery may be the greatest placebo of all. A 2014 knee pain study comparing elective surgical procedures and sham surgeries — fear not it was all on the level people knew what they were potentially getting into — found that faking a surgery (doing all the fasting and knocking them out and fake incisions and the whole routine) provided some benefit to the ailment in 74 percent of cases and was just as effective as the actual elective surgery roughly half the time. [FiveThirtyEight]

32 million
A CBO score of the latest GOP bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act found it would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 compared to current law. This straight repeal, no replace legislation compounds the uninsured more than other recent plans and could see a vote next week. [CNN Money]

$216 million
Back in March the New York Power Authority was reportedly presented with a preliminary plan from the Cuomo administration that would fund a light show on a bunch of bridges by raiding $216 million from the MTA. Now that New York City is bordering on open rebellion with the wretched state of the MTA’s subway system during the “summer of hell,” the Cuomo administration is reportedly distancing itself from the light-show plan.

A study from Ball State University reports that a quarter of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to offshoring, but the stunning statistic is an estimate that half of net business formation in the United States since the recession has happened in 0.64 percent of U.S. counties. That’s 20 of the 3,100 U.S. counties. [U.S. News & World Report, CBER]

Several people reportedly got sick after eating at the same Chipotle in Sterling, Va. This could not be worse news for the company that has seen previous outbreaks of food-borne illness.

O.J. Simpson has a strong chance of getting parole on Thursday. He began serving time on a sentence of a minimum of nine years and a maximum of 33 for his part of a sports memorabilia robbery almost nine years ago. He could be out as early as Oct. 1 if his parole is approved. [USA Today]

The Texas legislature is meeting for a special session this summer to consider House Bill 2899, which would strip away school district policies allowing transgender students to use the bathroom they prefer.

Thailand’s tourism business is booming, but the nation is trying to find out how to get tourism spending up without boosting the raw number of visitors, which this year will number 35 million foreign tourists. Namely, the nation wants their tourists to act more Australian, meaning staying longer and spending more money every day compared to their, say, English counterparts. [Bloomberg]

In 2009, $2.5 billion in subprime auto bonds were sold, a figure that jumped to $26 billion in 2016. Delinquency on paying auto loans is up as well, at 3.82 percent of automotive loans 90 days delinquent or more. Sound familiar to anyone? [Bloomberg]

Juicero is a start up that seeks to bring fresh pressed juice to the masses. Before January, the company priced each juice pack at about $5 to $7 and the juice pressing machine at $699, before later dropping to $399. Here’s the issue though: a Bloomberg investigation found that you could just use your hands to squeeze the juice out of the packs rather than paying for the hardware. Based on my own estimates, more people have hands than $399 to drop on a fancy juice pressing machine. Juicero announced last week they’re laying off 25 percent of their staff and will drop the price of their still superfluous press to the $200 price range. [Fortune]

$200,000s to the $500,000s
Range of 2017 sale prices for New York City Taxi medallions. Those are the valuable licenses that allow yellow cabs to operate, and they have historically been a solid investment for owners. Three years ago, those medallions were selling for as much as $1.3 million, but the arrival of Uber and Lyft have taken a massive bite out of their value. Now, this has had major secondary effects. There are credit unions that allowed medallion owners to take out lines of credit using the medallion as collateral. As a result of the collapse in value, enough medallion owners are now underwater that three New York lenders have been placed into conservatorship. [CNBC]

82 percent
Percentage of respondents to an AP/NORC poll who said wealthy people had too much power and influence on what happens in Washington. Other groups that a majority of respondents said had too much power: large businesses, political lobbyists and Wall Street. Now, 75 percent of respondents said people like them didn’t have enough power in Washington, which is fine, but who I’m really interested in is the 3 percent of respondents who said that people like them had too much power in Washington. The notion that about 1 in 33 Americans is like, “screw this, my friends and I shouldn’t have this much control over the future of the country” is a level of either impostor syndrome or moral clarity that I find immensely entertaining.
