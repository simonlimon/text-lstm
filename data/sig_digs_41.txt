4 states
Texas, Missouri, Georgia and Alabama are the only four states actively carrying out executions by lethal injection. Other states don’t have access to the drugs or have put executions on hold because of legal challenges. [The Marshall Project]

25 percent
Net income for U.S. farms is estimated to be $54.8 billion this year, but $13.9 billion of that — about 25 percent — will come from federal farm aid payments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. [Bloomberg]

93 percent
A win for the Golden State Warriors over Memphis tonight would break the record for regular-season wins, for which Golden State is currently tied at 72-9. Our NBA predictions model gives the Warriors a 93 percent chance of winning the game, so if you see Michael Jordan or any of the other 1995-96 Chicago Bulls dropping banana peels on the court, do alert a referee. [FiveThirtyEight]

250 jobs
Deutsche Bank announced Tuesday that it will not move forward on a plan to add 250 jobs to its Cary, North Carolina, operations following the passage of a law that the bank said removes protections for LGBT people. PayPal announced a similar decision earlier this month, citing the same law. [MarketWatch]

$1.2 million
Scott Walker’s campaign for the presidency did not end well, and its lingering debts aren’t going away. Walker’s campaign owes something like $1.2 million, and has resorted to selling assorted T-shirts for $45. [Channel 3000]

956,166,000 pounds
Amount of cheese produced in the United States in February. The U.S. puts out roughly a billion pounds of the good stuff per month, with mozzarella accounting for slightly more than a third of the production and cheddar accounting for about a quarter. [FiveThirtyEight]

2 votes
Donald Trump will be at least two votes short of his expectations in next week’s New York primary because his children Ivanka and Eric missed the deadline to register as Republicans. [The Daily Beast]

3 days
NASA has recovered the Kepler space telescope, which hunts for far-flung planets, after the spacecraft entered emergency mode last Thursday. Scientists are still trying to figure what went down during its three-day sabbatical. [Gizmodo]

53.7 percent
We’re a week away from the New York primary, and Donald Trump is the favorite to win the Republican race in both of FiveThirtyEight’s primary forecasts. The key thing to watch is how many delegates Trump pulls, which is a little complicated because New York delegates are allocated by congressional district as well as statewide. Right now, FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus projection gives Trump 53.7 percent of the vote. John Kasich and Ted Cruz are projected to roughly split the rest. [FiveThirtyEight]

20,000 bombs
The U.S. dropped upwards of 20,000 guided bombs and missiles into Iraq and Syria last year and has been transferring ammunition to its allies as part of the war against the Islamic State. This, among other things, has contributed to a diminished stockpile of bombs and missiles: The secretary of defense asked for funding for 45,000 smart bombs in the 2017 budget to replenish stocks. [Public Radio International]

$4.75 million
Estimated annual cost for the operation of a 180-foot yacht, according to the not-at-all-elitist-sounding U.S. Superyacht Association. This is a high maintenance fee for an already expensive product, so it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that some yachters are unhappy with the rate at which these boats are catching fire and burning into the sea. A string of yacht conflagrations around the world are the talk of the yacht club. [Bloomberg]

$5 billion
Goldman Sachs will pay a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion to borrowers and homeowners and $875 million in other claims as part of a $5 billion settlement over its sale of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. [CNBC]

3 holes-in-one
Danny Willett has won a weird Masters Tournament, one that last week saw a professional golfer fail to putt in a gimme ball seven times and on Sunday saw three holes-in-one — from Shane Lowry, Davis Love III and Louis Oosthuizen — on the same hole. [Digg]

50 hours
Approximate amount of time it takes visual effects designers to blur the appropriate parts of an episode of “Naked and Afraid,” a Discovery Channel program where participants are always naked and presumably afraid after being dumped in the wilderness. [The New York Times]

72 wins
The Golden State Warriors tied the NBA record for regular-season wins Sunday after defeating the San Antonio Spurs 92-86. The Warriors have 72 wins, tying them with the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. They’ll have one chance — a game Wednesday against Memphis — to get a 73rd win and the record all to themselves. [ESPN]

3,890
Estimated number of tigers living in the wild, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010. The problem of tiger conservation remains — deforestation and habitat destruction are still major threats to tiger populations — but it’s a good sign. [Scientific American]

$23.48 million
The Melissa McCarthy vehicle “The Boss” was the first to humble “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” at the box office, narrowly beating the superhero film’s domestic haul by $45,000 this weekend. “The Boss” pulled in $23.48 million in its opening weekend, while “Bats v. Supes” got $23.43 million in its third. [BoxOfficeMojo]

$5.5 billion
Size of the U.S. market for soap products, whose manufacturers are facing scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration over the chemicals in antibacterial soap. Evidence increasingly shows that these soaps may be doing more harm than good for the typical consumer and the FDA has asked soap manufacturers to demonstrate that their antibacterial products really are better than regular soap.

5 swipes
Freakin’ tourists: Hillary Clinton needed five swipes of a Metrocard in order to gain entrance to the New York City subway Wednesday as part of a campaign stop aboard the MTA. In fairness, her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, was unaware that the civilization of New York had moved beyond subway tokens up to last week. [POLITICO]

9
Ernie Els, by all means a rather good golfer, set a new Masters record Thursday after taking 9 strokes on a par-4 hole. The video of Els needing seven putts to finish the job is the only time in the history of the sport where golf was simply too brutal to watch. [ESPN]

€6,000
“Platooning” is a fuel-saving strategy developed by the trucking business where two or more trucks connected by Wi-Fi autonomously follow each other. This can lead to some massive savings on fuel: The pair uses 15 percent less fuel, which for two trucks platooning 100,000 miles can save €6,000, or about $6,820. [Quartz]

1.06 million miles
Secretary of State John Kerry is now the most well-traveled of any of the people who held the gig: After a flight to Bahrain on Wednesday he hit 1,060,000 miles traveled, beating previous record-holder Condoleezza Rice. [PBS]

$86 million
Amount raised for the general election by four super PACs — Priorities USA Action, Ready PAC, Correct The Record and American Bridge 21st Century — the first three of which support Hillary Clinton and the last of which aids Democrats with opposition research. That number is a minimum, keep in mind, as three of the PACs haven’t disclosed how much they’ve raised in 2016 yet. [Center for Public Integrity]

$2.1 trillion
Amount that would be added to the U.S. economy if it increased the proportion of women who worked from 64 percent to 74 percent, according to a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute. [BBC]

1 year
Don Blankenship, the former CEO of Massey Energy, was sentenced to a year in prison following his conviction for conspiracy to violate mine safety standards. In 2010 an explosion claimed the lives of 29 miners. [The Associated Press]

6 weeks
Tuesday the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to require employers to offer six weeks of paid leave for parents. This is great for new mothers, but is also, compared to the rest of the world, fantastic news for fathers, given that the citywide paternity leave policy now puts it ahead of many European nations. [FiveThirtyEight]

8.5 percent
According to a new report from the World Health Organization, 422 million adults have diabetes, which makes the worldwide rate 8.5 percent. That rate was 4.7 percent in 1980. [Bloomberg]

76 meteorites
Christie’s is auctioning off 76 meteorites later this month, which brings up the question of how precisely to put a price on a rock that fell from space. It used to be that they were priced based on weight, but since some meteorites are unambiguously cooler than others — anyone would admit a wayward chunk of moon has a lot more panache than some phoned-in detritus from the asteroid belt — meteorphiles took a page of of the diamond business’ book and coined the four S’s: size, shape, science and story. [Bloomberg]

$3,000
Does your dog have an Instagram account? Does that account have 150,000 to 250,000 followers? Well, that’s a good dog. It can also be a lucrative pooch, thanks to groups like The Dog Agency that will serve as reps for your canine and can fetch $3,000 per sponsored post for an account of that size. [The Wall Street Journal]

$30 million
George Mason University said it received $30 million in gifts after announcing that its law school would be named the “Antonin Scalia School of Law.” The university quickly announced the school would be named Antonin Scalia Law School, because nobody wants to say they got their degree from the A.S.S.O.L.

4th consecutive title
The University of Connecticut women’s basketball team won the NCAA tournament championship game for the fourth consecutive time, this year defeating Syracuse for the title. The Huskies finished the season undefeated and three players became the first in basketball history to win four NCAA titles. [ESPN]

7 times
Mike Tyson is the undisputed king of playing characters who are also Mike Tyson: He’s appeared in seven films credited as himself, most of them since “The Hangover,” putting the former boxer in third place behind two talk show hosts who probably work for scale, Jay Leno and Larry King. [FiveThirtyEight]

9 shows
The Backstreet Boys are kicking the tires on a Las Vegas residency, doing nine shows in the market as part of their 130-show tour. [CNN]

400 employees
PayPal has rescinded plans announced two weeks ago to open up a global operations center in the Charlotte area in light of a new law passed in North Carolina. In a post on the company website, President and CEO Dan Schulman said the law “invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens.” The company said the center would have employed 400 people. [Paypal]

$1,302
The filthy casuals at the FEC found that GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter racked up $1,302 worth of payments for Steam games on his campaign credit card. Hunter claims it is a mix up and pointed to his son accidentally using the wrong card to buy hella games. Regrettably, while it would be rather apt, for unfortunate reasons this political scandal can not be called “gamergate.” [The San Diego Union Tribune]

$140 million
David Tepper moved from New Jersey to Florida, and the hedge fund manager’s departure could cause legitimate issues for Jersey’s revenue calculation. Basically, 40 percent of the state’s revenue comes from personal income taxes; a third of that comes from 1 percent of taxpayers; and a 1 percent forecasting error means $140 million either way. With Tepper out, budgeters are legitimately concerned about how much the state could miss out on. [Bloomberg]

2.6 terabytes
The magnitude of leaks appears to be growing only larger: Compared to the 1.73 gigabyte leak WikiLeaks obtained of State Department communications, the latest reveal of 2.6 terabytes of data from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca takes the cake. The early findings from the leaked documents and emails paint a picture of a firm entrenched in the nitty gritty of making the kind of shell companies the rich and powerful use to squirrel away lots of money. [Wired]

$15 per hour
Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York each signed legislation that would gradually increase minimum wage in their states to $15 per hour. California will have a statewide $15 minimum wage by 2022, while New York’s increase is tied to economic indicators, with the wage going to $15 in New York City in three years. [ABC News]

90 percent
Wisconsin goes to the polls today. Sen. Ted Cruz is a 90 percent favorite to win the GOP primary, and Sen. Bernie Sanders has a 73 percent chance of winning the Democratic primary as of last night’s forecast. [FiveThirtyEight]

97 percent
Last night saw the NCAA Men’s tournament end with a championship win for Villanova, but tonight the women’s tournament comes to a close with a final between the University of Connecticut and Syracuse. The FiveThirtyEight model has Connecticut with a 97 percent chance of winning it. In related news: I have crushed my enemies, I have seen them driven before me, and I have heard the lamentations of their companions. I totally won the FiveThirtyEight office pool. [FiveThirtyEight]

$236,000
Clubs will pay a bunch of money for famous people — or people adjacent to famous people, like Kardashian-proximate Scott Disick — just to show up and drink some bubbles for an hour or so in the VIP area. Like with most stories about famous people and money, it’s difficult to narrow down a precise fee for different levels of fame, but thanks to a lawsuit from a club in Vegas we know that Nicki Minaj is being asked to a return a $236,000 fee for allegedly not upholding the terms of the deal: spend 60 minutes in Chateau starting at midnight. [GQ]

$2.6 billion
Alaska Airlines will buy airline Virgin America for $2.6 billion after a bidding war with JetBlue, nailing down terminal space in San Francisco International Airport and LAX plus landing rights in Dallas, New York and DC. [Business Insider]

31.2 percent
The percentage of international students studying in the U.S. in 2015 who were from China. In 2006, China’s students accounted for 11.1 percent of the international students’ contributions towards tuition, fees, and expenses while in 2014 that figure was 31.8 percent. [The Wall Street Journal]

46 percent
It’s going to be the University of North Carolina and Villanova in the 2016 NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament championship game tonight. Our model has Nova as the slight underdogs, with a 46 percent chance to win the tourney. That is also the probability I win a considerable amount of money from the FiveThirtyEight office pool, so let’s go Wildcats, my ConEd bill just came. [FiveThirtyEight]

276,000
Number of pre-orders for the Tesla Model 3 as of end-of-day Saturday, according to the car company’s CEO Elon Musk. According to Musk, that puts demand at — at least — double Tesla’s expectations. The Model 3 is Tesla’s attempt to bring an electric vehicle to the market that is more affordable to consumers than their current offerings. [@elonmusk, Engadget]

$52.3 million
Domestic haul for “Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice” in its second weekend at the box office, which is a 68.4 percent drop from the previous weekend. According to Box Office Mojo’s reckoning, that makes it the all time fifth-largest drop for a movie that opened above $100 million domestically. [Box Office Mojo]

$155 million
Amount investigators believe was transferred from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a state development fund, to Red Granite Pictures, a Hollywood movie studio, in 2012. Red Granite raised of $100 million to make “The Wolf of Wall Street,” but according to the Wall Street Journal there is no evidence the Malaysian fund saw any of gross from the movie.

A public service announcement: Today is April Fool’s Day, which means much of the internet will be terrible. Be extra-skeptical is all I’m saying.

0 Canadian teams
It’s a dire year in Canada: It is now mathematically impossible for any of the seven Canadian teams in the NHL to make it to the playoffs this year. The last time there was a hockey playoff without Canadian teams was 1970. [CBC]

12 to 14 movies
Amazon has said it intends to release 12 to 14 original movies annually through Amazon Studios. The first such film was Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq,” which was released on Amazon to Prime users in February, soon after it was released in 305 theaters to qualify for awards consideration. Amazon Studios bought four independent films at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. [Wired]

16 minutes
People taking the sleep-aid drug Belsomra fell asleep six minutes faster than those taking a placebo and stayed asleep 16 minutes longer, according to the company’s large-scale clinical trial. Despite this modest effect, its manufacturer, Merck, spent $96 million promoting the drug last year, and analysts believe over the next decade it will become the top-selling insomnia drug on the market. [The Huffington Post]

50 delegates
South Carolina’s Republican party makes candidates pledge to support the eventual nominee in order to get on the primary ballot. Donald Trump made that pledge and got on the primary ballot, and later won 50 delegates in the state. But on Tuesday, he said he has been treated unfairly and will no longer pledge to support the eventual nominee. This has thrown those 50 delegates into doubt, according to the South Carolina GOP chair. Sad! [TIME]

$3,600
How much a women’s soccer player on the U.S. national team makes per exhibition game, with a bonus of $1,350 for a win. If that person was playing for the men’s national team, the game check would be $5,000 with a win bonus of between $6,250 and $17,625. This disparity — plus the relative success of the world champion women’s soccer team compared with the not-world champion men’s soccer team — has led five players to file a federal wage discrimination complaint. [The New York Times]

$13,000
Amount sought by two fisherman who recovered a United States Geological Survey buoy that came unmoored from its home at a depth of 300 meters outside of Monterey Bay, California. The government would very much like this expensive scientific device back; the fishermen claim they salvaged it and thus own it, and would prefer to give it back in exchange for $13,000.

3 brackets
The guy who currently has the best NCAA men’s tournament bracket on Yahoo, James Kiki, forgot to pick a winner. This means there’s no way he can win the $50,000 prize for best bracket. It appears this isn’t a unique situation: of the top 30 brackets on Yahoo, three of them did not pick a champ. [Deadspin]

29 percent
Drop over the past year for Chipotle Mexican Grill stock, which may have a thing or two to do with, you know, all that food-borne illness. Despite the meltdown in the main business, Chipotle apparently filed a trademark this month for a new chain called “Better Burger.” That isn’t just going back to the drawing board, it is going back to Ray Kroc’s drawing board. [Bloomberg]

52 percent
Using the top daily story on Memeorandum, a political news aggregator, as a proxy for what the top political news story of the day is, Donald Trump has led the news on 104 of the 286 days between when he launched his campaign and this past Sunday. That’s 36 percent of the time. When the top political story was about the campaign, Trump has owned 52 percent of the political news days. Sad! [FiveThirtyEight]

988 delegates
Barring a massive victory in New York, Bernie Sanders is running out of ways to win the Democratic nomination. He’s 988 delegates away from a majority, and even now you really have to twist the math and throw spaghetti at the wall in order to plot a conceivable path in which he wins the nomination. [FiveThirtyEight]

21,764 households
Number of households in New York City that reported incomes over $1 million in 2013, which is 47 percent higher than the level in 2009. On the other hand, 54,348 households reported income that was less than $0, but do not feel bad for all of them: some could be savvy people who managed to make their income appear negative on paper despite otherwise large capital gains. [The New York Times]

$312 million
A 35 billion yen ($312 million) project to construct a refrigeration structure around the Fukushima nuclear site — which was damaged by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011 — is going to be switched on soon. The refrigerator creates an underground wall of frozen soil to prevent contaminated water from getting into the local groundwater. I assume that once activated this frozen wall will be defended by the proud men of the Night’s Watch. [TIME]
