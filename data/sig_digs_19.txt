14 states
Number of states that require students to reach proficiency in cursive writing, which seems dumb and vestigial. Still, that number is on the rise. Realistically, kids need to learn cursive only because people still write in cursive — we’d teach them Teeline if speed was really the goal. In any case, I think proficiency is a bit too far; maybe require students to reach the “able to sign things” level of capability and leave it at that. [Associated Press]

25 movies
Licensed toys — that is, toys tied to a movie or some other major piece of intellectual property — are a massive chunk of the roughly $20 billion toy business, representing about 30 percent of it in a given year. And this year, the licensed toy market should be huge: About 25 films will have toy tie-ins in 2017, compared to seven or eight in a typical year. [Bloomberg]

1,564 screens
Best-picture winner “Moonlight” enjoyed its widest theatrical release yet over the weekend, appearing on 1,564 screens and hauling in $2.5 million. The film has made a total of $25.3 million domestically so far. (It cost just $1.5 million to make.) [The Associated Press]

2.85 million viewers
Viewers of “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” since Jan. 20, compared to 2.96 million for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Colbert has been winning this battle, in part, because his viewer base has jumped since President Trump’s inauguration. But Fallon’s viewership has been fallen off too. [TV By The Numbers]

$237.8 million
“Logan,” Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart’s R-rated farewell to the X-Men franchise, had an incredible opening weekend at the box office, hauling in $237.8 million globally. [Variety]

4.3 percent fall
Federal officials searched facilities of Caterpillar Inc. in a criminal probe this week because the IRS believes Caterpillar owes them $2 billion in taxes and penalties. Shares fell 4.3 percent yesterday on the news. [Reuters]

250 percent
Growth in sales of almond milk from 2011 to 2015 in the U.S. Perhaps the spike is because almond milk is delicious, full of nutrients and low in carbohydrates, while regular milk is pointless unless it’s made into cheese. This dichotomy has made the cow-milk people mad, and now they’re claiming that almond milk — which has proven it is the growth commodity — doesn’t deserve to carry the name milk. [Buzzfeed]

$1,395
Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself yesterday from any investigation the Justice Department carries out regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The announcement came a day after the revelation Sessions had met with the Russian ambassador twice in the course of the campaign despite testifying to Congress he hadn’t. Sessions brushed off the concerns, indicating that the two meetings had nothing to do with the campaign and instead pertained to official government business. Which is cool, but then why, when in Cleveland for the RNC, where he met with the ambassador, did Sessions make two payments of $1,395 to a Sheraton hotel from his campaign account and not his Senate account? [The Wall Street Journal]

$2 million
How much of a bonus Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is eligible to receive annually, one that will be withheld this year in addition to a lucrative stock award because of the massive data breaches that occurred on her watch and led to hundreds of millions of dollars slashed from the sales price of the company. [ABC News]

$29.1 billion
Snap Inc. had a wild IPO yesterday, with the company behind Snapchat finishing the day at $24.48 on the New York Stock Exchange, up from an initial price of $17 per share. The company is now worth $29.1 billion. [Reuters]

2 meetings
Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on two separate occasions last year while Sessions was assisting President Donald Trump with his presidential campaign. This contradicts what Sessions told the Senate during his confirmation hearing: that he did not meet with any Russian official during the campaign. [The Washington Post]

60 dead birds, 14 stunned
The new US Bank stadium in Minneapolis is dangerous to far more than consistency at the quarterback position: Its giant glass wall is killing dozens of birds. Bird-lovers canvassed the stadium over 11 weeks last fall and inventoried 60 dead and 14 stunned birds around the complex. [The Guardian]

63.5° Fahrenheit
After verification, a March 2015 reading of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit at an Antarctic research base has been confirmed as the hottest temperature ever measured on the continent. This strikes me as bad. [Yahoo]

Intel claims it’s achieved 100 percent pay parity for women and minorities. Women now comprise 25.8 percent of the company’s employees. [Fortune, Intel]

2.3 televisions
Average number of televisions in American homes in the year 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which is down from 2.6 in 2009. The percentage of household units that do not own a television is 2.6 percent, double the rate in 2009. [EIA.gov]

Papa John’s pizza is testing a $2.99 fee that will let you cut to the front of line when ordering delivery. Just when you thought you could simply eat a pizza without confronting the fundamental class struggle inherent in capitalist society. [The Associated Press]

$3.75 per mile and $0.65 per minute
Current charge for Uber black car service in San Francisco, down from the ride hailing service’s prices of $4.90 per mile or $1.25 per minute in 2012. This has ticked drivers off, as seen in a leaked video of Uber’s CEO having a testy argument with his Uber driver over the company’s business practices. [Bloomberg]

That’s the unemployment rate in Denmark, a number so low that Danish companies cannot find skilled laborers to hire even though they’re desperate to do just that. [The New York Times]

2 cities
With Budapest, Hungary pulling out of the competition to host the 2024 Olympic Games, there are now only two cities that actually want the infrastructural nightmare that is the Olympics: Los Angeles and Paris. This is a problem for the Olympics, as it requires a new batch of suckers every four years to take on this flaming money pit. [Bloomberg]

12 hours
Twitter, a site beloved by white supremacists, is cracking down on people who say naughty words at elected officials by making it so that only their own followers can see their tweets for 12-hour periods. Good to see that the social network has its priorities in order. [CNBC]

88 in-person town halls
According to Legistorm, that’s how many town halls the 292 congressional Republicans have scheduled in the first two months of their term, with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner accounting for 35 of those. In the same period of the previous Congress, the GOP congressional delegation held 222 such events. [Vice]

2 3 Oscars
On Sunday night, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong winner of Best Picture, and it was an incredible nightmare on international television that has to be seen to be believed. The “La La Land” producers handled it well, handing off the Oscar to triumphant film “Moonlight,” which finished the night with wins in best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor. [The Guardian]

6 wins
Still, “La La Land” had a great night, with six wins. In Oscars history, 11 films earned six Oscars, 11 more won seven trophies, and 17 won eight or more. [The Hollywood Reporter]

21st nomination
Kevin O’Connell, a soundman on “Hacksaw Ridge,” had 20 Oscar nominations over the course of his career, but no wins. Last night, he won his first Oscar on the 21st try. [Yahoo]

Age of Damien Chazelle, “La La Land” director, who became the youngest-ever winner of the best director Oscar. [The Hollywood Reporter]

$1.5 million
“Moonlight” was made for $1.5 million, a ridiculously low budget for a best picture winner. There hasn’t been a winner with a budget that low since “Rocky.” [Mark Harris]

7 for 8
All in all, not a bad night for the FiveThirtyEight Oscar tracker. Despite missing out on the “Moonlight” upset, our model correctly called Casey Affleck for best actor, Emma Stone for best actress, Mahershala Ali for supporting actor, Viola Davis for supporting actress, Damien Chazelle for best director, “Zootopia” for best animated film, and “O.J.: Made in America” for documentary. Not bad. [FiveThirtyEight]

30 percent to 50 percent
Philadelphia supermarkets and distributors say beverage sales have dropped 30 percent to 50 percent after the city instituted a 1.5-cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks. On one hand, these are the same people who want to get the tax repealed, and we don’t have hard numbers yet, so take this with a grain of salt. On the other hand, the whole point of the tax is to reduce consumption of stuff that will kill you anyway, so … good job? [Philly.com]

1 bull
A bull escaped a slaughterhouse in the New York City borough of Queens on Tuesday morning, leading to a chase. The beast was eventually captured, and now it’s dead. What? It’s not like it was two llamas, people. It was always going to end like this. [The New York Times]

3.5 percent
The Trump administration will project gross domestic product growth of 3 to 3.5 percent a year when touting the economic impacts of proposed legislation, which is considerably higher than estimates from independent and nonpartisan agencies as well as private-sector economic forecasters. Recent economic growth has been around 2 percent, and economists consider growth above 3 percent very difficult to sustain. [The Wall Street Journal]

14 percent
A Johns Hopkins University, Harvard and Boston Children’s Hospital study found that suicide attempts of lesbian, gay and bisexual teenagers dropped 14 percent when their state legalized same-sex marriage. [The Guardian]

277 egregious errors
Columbia University accidentally sent out acceptance emails to 277 prospective graduate students, which it later rescinded. One would think a university typically considered prestigious would be capable of sending an email, but alas, Columbia joins MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Tulane, Fordham and more in the club of universities that have screwed this up. [The New York Times]
