47 percent
In the first 11 days of the open enrollment period, Americans signed up for 1.5 million health plans on healthcare.gov. That’s a 47 percent increase over a similar period last year. Enrollment in Obamacare ends after 45 days, less time than last year by half. [Bloomberg]

24 years
The Vans Warped Tour will come to an end in 2018, with its 24th tour to be its last. The punk show is the last major traveling music festival still running. [Billboard]

61.6 percent
Australia’s national postal survey on same-sex marriage delivered a decisive 61.6 percent win in favor of marriage equality. The survey wasn’t tied to the enactment of any policy, but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that parliament must commit to achieve the social reform by Christmas. [The Guardian]

$450.3 million
“Salvator Mundi” by Leonardo da Vinci sold at Christie’s for $450.3 million. That beats the previous record for the most expensive piece of art sold at auction by a considerable amount, a Picasso that went for $179.4 million in 2015. The marketing campaign that Christie’s mounted was extraordinary by art standards. It’s the only known painting by da Vinci still in a private collection. [The New York Times]

$860 million
Bloomberg has slashed its estimate of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s net worth from $3 billion to a measly $860 million. A Forbes investigation found that Ross may have been overstating his fortune to the press for some time to compounding effect. I’m sending thoughts and prayers to Ross’s recently lost third comma.

3 former soccer officials
The first of many prosecutions of world soccer officials began in Brooklyn earlier this week, with the kick off of the racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering trials of José María Marín, Juan Ángel Napout and Manuel Burga. More than 40 others were also arrested in connection to allegations of corruption in international soccer, with 23 already pleading guilty. [The Guardian]

18 counts
The jurors in the bribery trial of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez deadlocked once again Tuesday on all 18 counts. The judge told them to continue deliberating. [The Associated Press]

1993
Illumination Entertainment, which makes movies like “Sing” and “Minions,” is reportedly close to a deal with Nintendo to adapt the Super Mario Bros. franchise into a film. Nintendo is currently on track for its best financial year since 2010. The last time that Mario hit screens was in 1993 with the “Super Mario Bros.” live action film, a movie so bad that one of the most popular franchises on Earth has not seen a movie theater since. [CNN]

4.62 billion acres
That’s the total amount of cropland on Earth, according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey. Interestingly, that’s about 15 to 20 percent more than earlier estimates, as some areas were previously mapped inaccurately or unmapped altogether. [Bloomberg]

$5.5 billion
How much Google spent on traffic acquisition costs in the third quarter of 2017. That’s about 23 percent of its ad revenue. Google has to pay to get its search engine front and center on browsers, mobile phones and other services. One example: Firefox just rolled out a browser update that makes Google, not Yahoo, its default search engine. Yahoo was previously paying more than $300 million per year for that; it’s unclear what Google’s tab is. [Bloomberg]

26 ancient cities
A team of archaeologists was able to analyze 12,000 clay tablets detailing business transactions mentioning 26 ancient cities. Here’s the even cooler part: 11 of those cities are lost. However, using the locations of the 15 known cities and the observed frequencies of transactions, the researchers were able to estimate the potential locations for the lost cities. Imagine future archaeologists taking bus schedules for New York, Cleveland and Atlanta and using math to find the ancient lost city of Philly. [The Washington Post]

75 percent
Kalashnikov Kontsern, the maker of the AK-47, is going private. The Russian state-owned holding company Rostec sold just under half of Kalashnikov in 2013, part to Aleksei Krivoruchko and part to two other investors. But now those two investors as well as Rostec are reportedly selling shares to Krivoruchko, giving him roughly three quarters of the company and taking it into private hands. Until the imposition of sanctions stemming from the crisis in Ukraine, Kalashnikov was selling more rifles to the U.S. civilian market than to the Russian military. [The New York Times]

30 million people
What once was warmly called “pre-hypertension” is now the imposing “stage 1 hypertension,” according to new guidelines. That means 103 million people technically have hypertension, including 30 million people who until this point thought they were good. [Bloomberg]

$58,000
Based on a report from the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2019 households making $1 million per year or higher would on average enjoy a tax cut of $58,000 under the GOP tax plan. Households earning $50,000 to $75,000 would see an average tax cut of $688 in the same period. [Bloomberg]

$2.3 billion
That’s the value of a takeover bid from a private equity group for Buffalo Wild Wings. The restaurant business has seen a ton of consolidation lately, and Buffalo Wild Wings’ struggles with the rising price of chicken wings and declining foot traffic make it a compelling target. [The Wall Street Journal]

75 percent
The Department of Justice is distributing $772.5 million in recovered funds to Bernie Madoff’s victims and ultimately anticipates returning $4 billion to them. That, plus around $9 billion from the liquidation of his firm, means that when all is said and done, victims should get around 75 percent of their losses back. [Crain’s New York Business]

$319 per hour
That’s how much the contract of a small energy company from Montana was allowed to bill the Puerto Rican public power company per lineman per hour. That’s an exceptional rate — even for emergency work — about 17 times the average salary of a local lineman. The linemen themselves were making way less than that: $42 per hour plus overtime for some electrical workers, $63 per hour for a group of senior workers and up to $100 per hour for other workers on double time. [The New York Times]

$5 billion
That’s the approximate market value of Mattel, less than half of the $11 billion valuation of Hasbro. The two biggest U.S. toymakers may come together, as Hasbro has reportedly made a takeover offer. The toy business has taken a lot of hits lately, with the Chapter 11 filing of Toys “R” Us and the shift in consumer spending toward tech-based items. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.63 billion
Estimated losses in 2015 for untaxed cigarette sales in New York. The state has a $4.35 per pack tax and New York City has a further $1.50 per pack tax. The Tax Foundation estimates the city lost $740 million in 2015 and the state lost roughly $895 million due to black market sales, making the state the country’s cigarette smuggling capital.

2 Navy SEALS
Two members of SEAL Team Six are under investigation in the death of a staff sergeant in the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group stationed in Mali. Several members of the special operations community told The Daily Beast the staff sergeant — Logan Melgar — was found dead after discovering that the two SEALs had allegedly been pocketing money from a fund dedicated to paying local informants.

4.3 points
A study of 416 men and women who arrived in the E.R. with moderate to severe pain in their arms or legs found compelling evidence against the necessity of opioids in pain management. When patients rated their pain on an 11-point scale, the initial average pain was 8.7. After taking Tylenol and ibuprofin, it dropped 4.3 points. After taking Tylenol and oxycodone, it dropped 4.4 points. That’s not exactly the kind of results that encourage rolling the dice on opiates. [The New York Times]

5 women
Five women told the New York Times that comedian and director Louis C.K. engaged in sexual misconduct. The comedian has cancelled engagements and the premiere of his film “I Love You Daddy” on Thursday as the allegations came forward. [The New York Times]

21.7 percent
New York City voter turnout was a new low on Tuesday, down to 21.7 percent of the city’s 5 million registered voters. A competitive but not particularly close mayoral election in an off-Presidential year may have played a role here. [The New York Daily News]

30 interviews
Interviews with 30 people who knew Roy Moore between 1977 to 1982 indicate that during the time he was an assistant district attorney he pursued relationships with at least four young girls between the ages of 14 and 18. Moore, who is the Republican nominee for Alabama’s open senate seat, denied the allegations. [The Washington Post]

33 films
Hallmark will have premiered 33 new and original holiday films on its two channels by the end of the year, up from 28 new movies last year. The company cranked up its output back in 2008 and has now moved all-in on the holidays, with 136 total Christmas movies in their repertoire. [The Wall Street Journal]

120 percent
That would be the return on investment if you invested in a portfolio stuffed with “bubble” markets at the beginning of 2017. Turns out the prudent investor puts it all on Chinese real estate, cryptocurrencies, ETF, long term bonds, volatility bets, Tesla and Netflix, and Tencent Holdings. Who would have guessed?

4 countries
A Facebook pilot program described by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner probably sounded far better on paper. Available in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia, Facebook’s intention is to cut back on the spread of revenge porn. However, their way of getting out ahead of the spread of the illicit material is to have potential victims send Facebook the potentially shared images over Messenger so the company can use image matching technology to prevent people from sharing it. This, as if you think about it for more than a minute will become clear, has some inherent privacy downsides. [CNBC]

12 tons
Colombian police seized over 12 tons of cocaine Wednesday in the largest ever drug bust in the country. The blow was stored under “four farms in a banana-growing region,” which is certainly one way to obtain a second income in a difficult banana economy. Colombia produces 910 tons of cocaine per year, so this is literally more than one percent of all the cocaine in one raid. [Reuters]

36 undisclosed ships
An American Public Media investigation has found Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is financially linked to 36 ships he did not earlier disclose. This would bring the total number of ships Ross has a financial stake in to 75, mainly moving oil and gas around the world. This is an issue given the cabinet member has a large degree of influence on the international shipping industry he apparently directly benefits from. [APM]

90 percent
That’s the percentage of crashes that are caused by human error. As it stands, RAND forecasts 2.4 million road deaths over the next 50 years under current human drivers. With driverless cars that reduce error, that number will decrease. So with fully autonomous cars en route, we need to have a serious discussion of how safe we’ll require vehicles to be before allowing them on roads. On one hand, we can insist the cars would be perfect; the RAND analysis assuming nearly perfect autonomous vehicles hitting roads in 2040 would save 580,000 lives over the next 50 years. But introducing less perfect cars far sooner — say, cars that are 10 percent safer than the average human hitting streets in 2020 — you’d save 1,100,000 lives over the same 50 year period. [RAND]

6,752 store closings
That’s the number of announced retail locations in the United States that were scheduled to close in quarters 1 through 3 of 2017. That’s double last year’s total already, and it’s not like new retail locations are taking over: in the same period there were 3,044 location openings. [Bloomberg]

51,000 displaced Texans
According to mayors and county leaders who spoke at a Texas House subcommittee hearing, the long term response from the federal government to Hurricane Harvey has come up short. Over 51,000 Texans were still living in hotel rooms as of last week as they had been displaced from their homes and 26,000 are in temporary housing of their own selection. [The Texas Tribune]

9 percent
Percentage of tweets that hit the 140 character limit on Twitter, according to data from the company. Yesterday they increased the number of characters that can appear in a tweet to 280, thus ruining the service and doubling the length of rope available to Americans with which to hang themselves. Just think of all the careers that will be ruined with that extra 140 characters of self destructive firepower. [Ars Technica]

17 percent
Snap Inc., the public company behind Snapchat, took a beating yesterday after missing analyst revenue predictions. Shares were down 22 percent at one point before finishing down about 17 percent. The company announced it’s going to completely overhaul its core product, a risky if necessary venture for a public company to pull off. [Bloomberg]

48-47
A huge shocker in Tuesday’s election in Virginia is just how close the state house may be to flipping to Democrats. As it stands, Democrats have 48 House of Delegates seats in the bag and Republicans have 47. Five races are in recount territory where there’s a margin of 129 votes or fewer, and if all break the way they appear to be it’ll be a 50-50 split. [FiveThirtyEight]

53.9 percent
Democrat Ralph Northam had a resounding win of Virginia’s competitive gubernatorial election yesterday. Republican rival Ed Gillespie closely tied his fortunes to the president’s in the waning weeks of the election. It was a pretty great night for Democrats overall: Phil Murphy won in New Jersey and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio won reelection handily. [FiveThirtyEight]

600 square miles
Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is eliminating the driver in Phoenix. Beginning in the Chandler part of town, a group of test riders will be able to hail completely driverless cars to take them to and from locations in the area. Over time, that domain will expand to 600 square miles, and then further into cities outside of Phoenix. [Recode]

$700 million
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have overstated the extent of his own wealth, a ticked-off Forbes magazine reports. The magazine maintains a list of the richest 400 Americans, one that Ross was on for some time. Ross’s net worth was listed by the magazine last year at $2.9 billion — an amount Ross claimed was too low and should be closer to $3.7 billion. Imagine their surprise when financial disclosure forms needed to join the cabinet reported the “billionaire” had $700 million in assets. Forbes has removed Ross from their list of rich guys, and everyone involved comes off as super duper aggravated by this turn of events. [Forbes]

+1.15
You heard that Russian news, right? That story of how Russia interfered in American politics? If you’re thinking about Russian interference in the election of Donald Trump, you may watch MSNBC; if you’re thinking about Mueller’s charges about the White House campaign’s collusion, you may watch CNN; and if your mind goes to Uranium or Hillary Clinton or the Dossier, yeah, you watch Fox News, right? Talk of the “Dossier” was 1.15 standard deviations above the mean on Fox, just one finding from an analysis of the most common words used on the three cable news networks in what may be my favorite FiveThirtyEight politics story of the year. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 ISIS news items per day
Turns out the fall of Raqqa really put a dent into ISIS’s media strategy. Since the Islamic State lost most of its territory, media items from ISIS channels have dropped to 10 items per day from about 30 items per day, according to watchers of the wannabe nation’s propaganda outlets. [NPR]

22 percent
Percentage of Americans who are spiritual, but not religious, according to a new PRRI survey. Compare that to the 100 percent of guys you dated in college who identified as such. [PRRI]

90 percent
Percentage of the Japanese auto market that goes to Japanese automobile brands. Why that is — essentially, a superb dealer network that truly understands what Japanese consumers desire — is a major pickle for American manufacturers, who cant seem to break into the world’s third largest car market. [The Atlantic]

2020
Far too many companies have decided to adapt a “Vision 20/20” plan, according the research from the Wall Street Journal, as the upcoming year and the serendipitous connection to people seeing well has combined to a nearly perfect if overdone nomenclature for a five year plan. [The Wall Street Journal]

$105 billion
Broadcom is attempting to purchase Qualcomm for $105 billion. You may not know these companies off the top of your head, but it’s pretty likely the device you’re reading this on contains a chip manufactured by one of the two firms. [The New York Times]

$2.5 billion
The nation’s power utilities are just beginning to understand the costs of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. NextEra Energy, the owner of the largest utility in Florida, estimated $1.3 billion in damages last week. Duke Energy estimated $500 million in damages in Florida, Southern Co. estimated $150 million. NRG Energy put their costs at $40 million and Texas’ American Electric Power Co. put their costs at $250 million to $300 million. All told, about $2.5 billion. [Bloomberg]

$600 per month
That’s the top average rate in New York and London to rent a parking space. Investing in parking spaces — buying them for thousands of dollars, renting them for hundreds, and years later flipping them for hundreds of thousands — is a legitimate financial strategy, with all the benefits of owning real estate and none of the problems of dealing with tenants. [The New York Times]

11 arrested princes
Saturday night 11 princes, four ministers, and many further former ministers were arrested in Saudi Arabia. The most prominent of those arrested was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an international financier who controls Kingdom Holding and has had staked in Twitter, Apple, Citigroup and 21st Century Fox. [The New York Times]

8 percent
That’s the percentage of Facebook owned by companies controlled by Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire investor who also owns 5 percent of Twitter. New documents leaked indicate that the investments were backed by “hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin” obfuscated through shell companies. [The New York Times]

$121 million
“Thor: Ragnarok” had a huge weekend at the box office, pulling in $121 million domestically on top of $427 million over its two week international release. [The Associated Press]

68 percent
Percentage of people in STEM master’s degree programs last year who were international students, according to an annual survey of U.S. and Canadian universities. In 1994, only 40 percent of computer science Ph.D. students were international. [The New York Times]

70 percent
Percentage of Germans who support a new law that would make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram liable for fines up to a staggering 50 million euros. They’d earn those fines for leaving “manifestly unlawful” content up for more than 24 hours. Facebook has 28 million Germans on it, but the company has a bit of an image problem there because of the role it played in bringing attention to far-right nationalist groups, a political faction with which many Germans have some substantial historical problems.

4,000 members
Number of adherents to Ásatrú, a religious movement in Iceland that worships pre-Christian pagan gods like Thor, Odin, and Freya. It’s the largest non-Christian religion in Iceland. However, the group is now contending with an unfortunate problem: international white supremacist groups are attempting to co-opt the iconography of their faith. [The Atlantic]

41,000 blood samples
A study of a cohort of 6,700 children over 12 years analyzed 41,000 blood samples and discovered why people who have had dengue fever once will sometimes have a far more severe form if they get it a second time. Antibodies made to fight the first infection can fall to a low level, imperiling those people if dengue strikes again. [STAT News]

361,000
Number of people, according to new Nielsen data, who watched all nine “Stranger Things” episodes within the first 24 hours of their release. Each episode of the season has had over 4 million viewers per episode and 8.8 million viewers on average. Netflix disputes Nielsen’s numbers. [Variety]

$1.5 trillion
House Republicans have released their tax cut plan. Businesses benefit the most, with about $1 trillion in tax cuts coming from a reduction in the corporate rate cut, and another half trillion coming on the individual side through a realignment of tax brackets, the elimination of the alternative minimum and estate taxes, and an increase to the standard deduction. To pay for this, the bill caps the deduction for state and local taxes, limits the mortgage interest deduction, and gets rid of tax breaks for student loan interest, adoption, medical expenses and more.

75 percent
The Department of Justice is distributing $772.5 million in recovered funds to Bernie Madoff’s victims and ultimately anticipates returning $4 billion to them. That, plus around $9 billion from the liquidation of his firm, means that when all is said and done, victims should get around 75 percent of their losses back. [Crain’s New York Business]

$319 per hour
That’s how much the contract of a small energy company from Montana was allowed to bill the Puerto Rican public power company per lineman per hour. That’s an exceptional rate — even for emergency work — about 17 times the average salary of a local lineman. The linemen themselves were making way less than that: $42 per hour plus overtime for some electrical workers, $63 per hour for a group of senior workers and up to $100 per hour for other workers on double time. [The New York Times]

$5 billion
That’s the approximate market value of Mattel, less than half of the $11 billion valuation of Hasbro. The two biggest U.S. toymakers may come together, as Hasbro has reportedly made a takeover offer. The toy business has taken a lot of hits lately, with the Chapter 11 filing of Toys “R” Us and the shift in consumer spending toward tech-based items. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.63 billion
Estimated losses in 2015 for untaxed cigarette sales in New York. The state has a $4.35 per pack tax and New York City has a further $1.50 per pack tax. The Tax Foundation estimates the city lost $740 million in 2015 and the state lost roughly $895 million due to black market sales, making the state the country’s cigarette smuggling capital.

2 Navy SEALS
Two members of SEAL Team Six are under investigation in the death of a staff sergeant in the Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group stationed in Mali. Several members of the special operations community told The Daily Beast the staff sergeant — Logan Melgar — was found dead after discovering that the two SEALs had allegedly been pocketing money from a fund dedicated to paying local informants.

4.3 points
A study of 416 men and women who arrived in the E.R. with moderate to severe pain in their arms or legs found compelling evidence against the necessity of opioids in pain management. When patients rated their pain on an 11-point scale, the initial average pain was 8.7. After taking Tylenol and ibuprofin, it dropped 4.3 points. After taking Tylenol and oxycodone, it dropped 4.4 points. That’s not exactly the kind of results that encourage rolling the dice on opiates. [The New York Times]

5 women
Five women told the New York Times that comedian and director Louis C.K. engaged in sexual misconduct. The comedian has cancelled engagements and the premiere of his film “I Love You Daddy” on Thursday as the allegations came forward. [The New York Times]

21.7 percent
New York City voter turnout was a new low on Tuesday, down to 21.7 percent of the city’s 5 million registered voters. A competitive but not particularly close mayoral election in an off-Presidential year may have played a role here. [The New York Daily News]

30 interviews
Interviews with 30 people who knew Roy Moore between 1977 to 1982 indicate that during the time he was an assistant district attorney he pursued relationships with at least four young girls between the ages of 14 and 18. Moore, who is the Republican nominee for Alabama’s open senate seat, denied the allegations. [The Washington Post]

33 films
Hallmark will have premiered 33 new and original holiday films on its two channels by the end of the year, up from 28 new movies last year. The company cranked up its output back in 2008 and has now moved all-in on the holidays, with 136 total Christmas movies in their repertoire. [The Wall Street Journal]

120 percent
That would be the return on investment if you invested in a portfolio stuffed with “bubble” markets at the beginning of 2017. Turns out the prudent investor puts it all on Chinese real estate, cryptocurrencies, ETF, long term bonds, volatility bets, Tesla and Netflix, and Tencent Holdings. Who would have guessed?

4 countries
A Facebook pilot program described by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner probably sounded far better on paper. Available in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia, Facebook’s intention is to cut back on the spread of revenge porn. However, their way of getting out ahead of the spread of the illicit material is to have potential victims send Facebook the potentially shared images over Messenger so the company can use image matching technology to prevent people from sharing it. This, as if you think about it for more than a minute will become clear, has some inherent privacy downsides. [CNBC]

12 tons
Colombian police seized over 12 tons of cocaine Wednesday in the largest ever drug bust in the country. The blow was stored under “four farms in a banana-growing region,” which is certainly one way to obtain a second income in a difficult banana economy. Colombia produces 910 tons of cocaine per year, so this is literally more than one percent of all the cocaine in one raid. [Reuters]

36 undisclosed ships
An American Public Media investigation has found Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is financially linked to 36 ships he did not earlier disclose. This would bring the total number of ships Ross has a financial stake in to 75, mainly moving oil and gas around the world. This is an issue given the cabinet member has a large degree of influence on the international shipping industry he apparently directly benefits from. [APM]

90 percent
That’s the percentage of crashes that are caused by human error. As it stands, RAND forecasts 2.4 million road deaths over the next 50 years under current human drivers. With driverless cars that reduce error, that number will decrease. So with fully autonomous cars en route, we need to have a serious discussion of how safe we’ll require vehicles to be before allowing them on roads. On one hand, we can insist the cars would be perfect; the RAND analysis assuming nearly perfect autonomous vehicles hitting roads in 2040 would save 580,000 lives over the next 50 years. But introducing less perfect cars far sooner — say, cars that are 10 percent safer than the average human hitting streets in 2020 — you’d save 1,100,000 lives over the same 50 year period. [RAND]

6,752 store closings
That’s the number of announced retail locations in the United States that were scheduled to close in quarters 1 through 3 of 2017. That’s double last year’s total already, and it’s not like new retail locations are taking over: in the same period there were 3,044 location openings. [Bloomberg]

51,000 displaced Texans
According to mayors and county leaders who spoke at a Texas House subcommittee hearing, the long term response from the federal government to Hurricane Harvey has come up short. Over 51,000 Texans were still living in hotel rooms as of last week as they had been displaced from their homes and 26,000 are in temporary housing of their own selection. [The Texas Tribune]

9 percent
Percentage of tweets that hit the 140 character limit on Twitter, according to data from the company. Yesterday they increased the number of characters that can appear in a tweet to 280, thus ruining the service and doubling the length of rope available to Americans with which to hang themselves. Just think of all the careers that will be ruined with that extra 140 characters of self destructive firepower. [Ars Technica]

17 percent
Snap Inc., the public company behind Snapchat, took a beating yesterday after missing analyst revenue predictions. Shares were down 22 percent at one point before finishing down about 17 percent. The company announced it’s going to completely overhaul its core product, a risky if necessary venture for a public company to pull off. [Bloomberg]

48-47
A huge shocker in Tuesday’s election in Virginia is just how close the state house may be to flipping to Democrats. As it stands, Democrats have 48 House of Delegates seats in the bag and Republicans have 47. Five races are in recount territory where there’s a margin of 129 votes or fewer, and if all break the way they appear to be it’ll be a 50-50 split. [FiveThirtyEight]

53.9 percent
Democrat Ralph Northam had a resounding win of Virginia’s competitive gubernatorial election yesterday. Republican rival Ed Gillespie closely tied his fortunes to the president’s in the waning weeks of the election. It was a pretty great night for Democrats overall: Phil Murphy won in New Jersey and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio won reelection handily. [FiveThirtyEight]

600 square miles
Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is eliminating the driver in Phoenix. Beginning in the Chandler part of town, a group of test riders will be able to hail completely driverless cars to take them to and from locations in the area. Over time, that domain will expand to 600 square miles, and then further into cities outside of Phoenix. [Recode]

$700 million
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have overstated the extent of his own wealth, a ticked-off Forbes magazine reports. The magazine maintains a list of the richest 400 Americans, one that Ross was on for some time. Ross’s net worth was listed by the magazine last year at $2.9 billion — an amount Ross claimed was too low and should be closer to $3.7 billion. Imagine their surprise when financial disclosure forms needed to join the cabinet reported the “billionaire” had $700 million in assets. Forbes has removed Ross from their list of rich guys, and everyone involved comes off as super duper aggravated by this turn of events. [Forbes]

+1.15
You heard that Russian news, right? That story of how Russia interfered in American politics? If you’re thinking about Russian interference in the election of Donald Trump, you may watch MSNBC; if you’re thinking about Mueller’s charges about the White House campaign’s collusion, you may watch CNN; and if your mind goes to Uranium or Hillary Clinton or the Dossier, yeah, you watch Fox News, right? Talk of the “Dossier” was 1.15 standard deviations above the mean on Fox, just one finding from an analysis of the most common words used on the three cable news networks in what may be my favorite FiveThirtyEight politics story of the year. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 ISIS news items per day
Turns out the fall of Raqqa really put a dent into ISIS’s media strategy. Since the Islamic State lost most of its territory, media items from ISIS channels have dropped to 10 items per day from about 30 items per day, according to watchers of the wannabe nation’s propaganda outlets. [NPR]

22 percent
Percentage of Americans who are spiritual, but not religious, according to a new PRRI survey. Compare that to the 100 percent of guys you dated in college who identified as such. [PRRI]

90 percent
Percentage of the Japanese auto market that goes to Japanese automobile brands. Why that is — essentially, a superb dealer network that truly understands what Japanese consumers desire — is a major pickle for American manufacturers, who cant seem to break into the world’s third largest car market. [The Atlantic]

2020
Far too many companies have decided to adapt a “Vision 20/20” plan, according the research from the Wall Street Journal, as the upcoming year and the serendipitous connection to people seeing well has combined to a nearly perfect if overdone nomenclature for a five year plan. [The Wall Street Journal]

Broadcom is attempting to purchase Qualcomm for $105 billion. You may not know these companies off the top of your head, but it’s pretty likely the device you’re reading this on contains a chip manufactured by one of the two firms. [The New York Times]

$2.5 billion
The nation’s power utilities are just beginning to understand the costs of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. NextEra Energy, the owner of the largest utility in Florida, estimated $1.3 billion in damages last week. Duke Energy estimated $500 million in damages in Florida, Southern Co. estimated $150 million. NRG Energy put their costs at $40 million and Texas’ American Electric Power Co. put their costs at $250 million to $300 million. All told, about $2.5 billion. [Bloomberg]

$600 per month
That’s the top average rate in New York and London to rent a parking space. Investing in parking spaces — buying them for thousands of dollars, renting them for hundreds, and years later flipping them for hundreds of thousands — is a legitimate financial strategy, with all the benefits of owning real estate and none of the problems of dealing with tenants. [The New York Times]

11 arrested princes
Saturday night 11 princes, four ministers, and many further former ministers were arrested in Saudi Arabia. The most prominent of those arrested was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an international financier who controls Kingdom Holding and has had staked in Twitter, Apple, Citigroup and 21st Century Fox. [The New York Times]

8 percent
That’s the percentage of Facebook owned by companies controlled by Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire investor who also owns 5 percent of Twitter.

Percentage of Germans who support a new law that would make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram liable for fines up to a staggering 50 million euros. They’d earn those fines for leaving “manifestly unlawful” content up for more than 24 hours. Facebook has 28 million Germans on it, but the company has a bit of an image problem there because of the role it played in bringing attention to far-right nationalist groups, a political faction with which many Germans have some substantial historical problems.

Number of adherents to Ásatrú, a religious movement in Iceland that worships pre-Christian pagan gods like Thor, Odin, and Freya. It’s the largest non-Christian religion in Iceland. However, the group is now contending with an unfortunate problem: international white supremacist groups are attempting to co-opt the iconography of their faith. [The Atlantic]

41,000 blood samples
A study of a cohort of 6,700 children over 12 years analyzed 41,000 blood samples and discovered why people who have had dengue fever once will sometimes have a far more severe form if they get it a second time. Antibodies made to fight the first infection can fall to a low level, imperiling those people if dengue strikes again. [STAT News]

Number of people, according to new Nielsen data, who watched all nine “Stranger Things” episodes within the first 24 hours of their release. Each episode of the season has had over 4 million viewers per episode and 8.8 million viewers on average. Netflix disputes Nielsen’s numbers. [Variety]

$1.5 trillion
House Republicans have released their tax cut plan. Businesses benefit the most, with about $1 trillion in tax cuts coming from a reduction in the corporate rate cut, and another half trillion coming on the individual side through a realignment of tax brackets, the elimination of the alternative minimum and estate taxes, and an increase to the standard deduction. To pay for this, the bill caps the deduction for state and local taxes, limits the mortgage interest deduction, and gets rid of tax breaks for student loan interest, adoption, medical expenses and more.

There’s been considerable research into the negative economic effects of a Walmart entering a town, but now we’re getting a look at the deleterious effects of its departure. A supercenter that was open for a decade in McDowell County, West Virginia, closed last year, and its absence has led to a loss of local tax base, a loss of jobs and a lack of access to fresh food for residents of the U.S. county that ranks last in the country in life expectancy.

400,000 streams
Nearly the number of times “Happy Birthday, Matthew” has been streamed on Spotify, just one of many clever schemes to turn the incremental payments of single streams into a steady flow of income. Everybody has a birthday, there a lot of people are named Matthew, and some of those Matthews want to stream a personalized version of “Happy Birthday” on the big day. The business then scales because — and this is huge — there are several additional names besides “Matthew.” [Vulture]

Christie’s 15 percent favorability rating is barely better than that of past governors who were actual crooks. [FiveThirtyEight]

Last night at 8 p.m. Eastern, President Trump’s travel ban went into effect, partially — banning visa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees unless they have “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” Some family relations count (including a parent, child, spouse or sibling), and some don’t (including a grandparent, cousin, niece or uncle). And importantly, the administration’s guidelines don’t consider a refugee’s ties to a resettlement agency — often the only connection refugees have in the U.S. — as a “bona fide relationship.” [The Guardian]

That increased the amount of retail space by 21 percent just as e-commerce began to make retail space less valuable, and retail space has outpaced demand in much of the rest of the country too. Sure, brick-and-mortar stores have been hurt by online shopping, but the recent problems for malls and other shopping centers are far from entirely external. [Bloomberg]

-12 seats
When Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election in April, her party had 330 seats in Parliament, slightly more than the 326 required for a majority. Expecting she could beat Labor soundly and bolster her support, she called an unscheduled election. This went extremely badly for her. With some results still being finalized, Conservatives lost 12 seats in Thursday’s election; Labour gained 31. Conservatives can still form a government, but they’ll need help. [Bloomberg, FiveThirtyEight]

2nd longest break
President Trump may be a Twitter addict, but he just refrained from firing off any 140-character thoughts for one of the longest stretches of time since launching his bid for the presidency. As of earlier today, his most recent tweet was Wednesday, and despite reports he considered live-tweeting the congressional testimony of his fired FBI director, POTUS had been mum. Until, that is, he re-entered the fray at 6:10 a.m. Eastern this morning. [The Washington Post]

$609
Cost of a box of two Epi-pens. Still. As The New York Times wrote, “Though this simple medical device contains only about $1 of the drug epinephrine, the company that sells it, Mylan, earned the public’s enmity and lawmakers’ scrutiny after ratcheting up prices to $609 a box.” Despite that outcry, the price remains.

442 non-nominees
President Trump slammed Democrats on Monday for not approving his ambassadors quickly enough. It’s an odd complaint because ambassadors can get through Senate confirmation with zero Democratic support (diplomatic nominees can’t be filibustered), and the actual bottleneck appears to be at the White House: The administration has not yet picked a nominee for 442 of 559 key government positions requiring Senate affirmation.

Approximate amount a drug dealer can make from a kilogram of heroin costing around $4,000. This is done by diluting the pure product.

10,000 boxes
General Mills is setting up a sweepstakes where the prize is one of 10,000 boxes of marshmallow-only Lucky Charms cereal. When you think about it, this is the closest we’re gonna get to what’s essentially an extremely shabby version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and based on the already ridiculous sugar content of standard Charms, it will almost certainly result in about as many human casualties. Seriously, you can just buy the marshmallows in bulk on the internet if you’re cool with your UPS guy losing all remaining respect for you. [StarTribune]

Organizers of the notorious Fyre Festival, a failed attempt at a Bahamas music festival promoted by “influencers,” borrowed up to $7 million in a mad last-minute attempt to make good on the festival’s lofty promises and avoid becoming an international laughing stock, new documents show. It did not go great. [Bloomberg]

How long Afrobeat musician Femi Kuti held a single note, breaking the record held by saxophone god Kenny G (45 minutes, 47 seconds). The issue? Apparently Kenny G’s record had already been broken 17 years ago by fellow saxophonist Vann Burchfield, who held a note for 47 minutes and 6 seconds. Kuti is retrying the attempt this Sunday, but why did no one know about Burchfield’s achievement? As he told NPR, “I knew that I had broke the record.

Here’s some financially irksome news: Fraud rates are steadily rising in auto loan applications. Why should that worry you? During the housing crisis in 2009, fraud rates in the mortgage lending market exceeded the 1 percent threshold, and auto loans are getting ever closer to that level, with total fraud expected to double from about $2-3 billion in 2015 to $4-6 billion in 2017.

3 laptop fires
Number of incidents involving a laptop-caused fire on flights in the U.S. in 2016, according to a FAA document reviewed by The Daily Beast. There were 33 such incidents involving personal electronic devices generally. Still, the Department of Homeland Security is considering banning laptops in carry-on bags on flights to the U.S. from Europe, presumably so they can be stowed away in the baggage area far away from fire extinguishers.

President Trump “terminated” FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday. The official reasoning for the sacking had to do with Comey’s handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email usage. But many members of Congress suspect the firing had more to do with the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and potential ties to Trump associates.

1 percent
Under the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law, investors can submit shareholder resolutions provided that they own $2,000 worth of stock in a company, or 1 percent, whichever is lower. A bill in Congress now would remove that $2,000 option, substantially raising the burden for introducing resolutions, which investors have used to push for changes at companies. [International Business Times]

20
The Washington Post examined the voter registrations of 395 members of Congress and found at least 20 of them do not live in the district they represent. This isn’t necessarily a huge issue — members are only required to live in the same state, not the same district, and the redistricting process means people’s homes can be cut out of the district they have long represented — but it can be used as an election-season cudgel by opponents. [The Washington Post]

23.9 percent
With an estimated 23.9 percent of the vote, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the French presidential election, scooping up endorsements from the right and left for his second-round effort. The cross-party unity is in part because with 21.4 percent of the vote, the far-right Nationalist Front candidate Marine Le Pen also made that runoff. [The New York Times]

34 percent
Share of Americans who approve of President Donald Trump giving top government jobs to his son-in-law and daughter; 61 percent of respondents to an ABC News poll said they disapproved . Nepotism still doesn’t go over well, regardless of what people think of a president overall. [ABC News]

40 percent
People are living longer, which means they’re more likely to get cancer in the long run because they’re not dying of other stuff. In the U.S., experts estimate we’re going to need about 40 percent more oncologists by 2025 to meet eventual demand. Shortfalls are likely in the near future, so this is a problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. [Nautilus]

Relative sea level rise in South Florida since 1992. But property owners in South Florida aren’t so much worried that the sea will flood their homes anytime soon; they’re worried that the market will begin pricing in the inevitable rise in sea levels, which could lead to a considerable mark down on their home values. [Bloomberg]

5 studios
The James Bond franchise is up for grabs. Sony (which has been distributing the films for more than a decade), Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Annapurna are competing to score 007 distribution rights. It isn’t a particularly lucrative investment — the distributor will only see a potion of the profits — but bagging James Bond is a heck of a status symbol. [The New York Times]

The state of Mississippi is barely approving anyone for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, a federal welfare program for low-income residents. Last year, 11,717 people applied, and just 167 were approved, according to an analysis by the progressive news site ThinkProgress. That measly approval rate, 1.4 percent, is a huge outlier.

[The New York Times, Jon Williams]

Zendrive, a driving analytics company, found that three million drivers, traveling 5.6 billion miles, were using their phones 88 percent of their journeys. As Wired wrote, “The average driver spends 3.5 minutes on the phone per one hour trip, a stat that sounds worse when you realize just a two-second distraction increases your risk of crashing by 20 percent.” [Wired]

U.S. income taxes are due today, so be sure to get on that. In 2015, more than 20 million people — about 1-in-7 filers, waited until the final week to send in their tax returns. That’s kind of ridiculous because most people get a refund for all their trouble anyway. [FiveThirtyEight]

United Airlines, after violently kicking a man off an overbooked flight so some employees could get somewhere (and reaping the public relations rewards when video of the incident went viral), announced a new policy that would not allow employees to bump passengers from overbooked flights which were already boarded. A spokeswoman told The Times: “We issued an updated policy to make sure crews traveling on our aircraft are booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure.” [The New York Times]

610,000 crabs
The blood of horseshoe crabs is essential for the development of a number of crucial medical tests. To get it, the biomedical industry harvests blood from 610,000 crabs a year (as of 2012), and the number is rising. They pull about a third of the animals’ blood and put them back in the ocean, but that doesn’t mean the crabs are perfectly healthy. So determining the death rate of returned horseshoe crabs — assumed to be 15 percent but possibly closer to 29 percent — is a necessary avenue of research for the future of health care.

$15.3 million
“The Fate of the Furious,” the latest installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, is out, and one element of the films related to neither alacrity nor ferocity is an unabashed love of Corona beer. Indeed, there’s so much Corona in the series that it may look like product placement. Surprisingly, it is not: Corona hasn’t paid them a dime; the makers of the movies just like Corona, and over the previous seven films the beverage has accumulated some $15.3 million worth of free product placement just by being the beer of choice for Vin Diesel’s friends.

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. In honor of the women’s (Sunday) and men’s (Monday) NCAA basketball championship games, as well as Major League Baseball’s opening day — and not at all because regular author Walt Hickey asked sportswriter Neil Paine to fill in for him — today’s edition is a special sports SigDig.

14 home runs
The number of dingers hit by San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner since the start of the 2014 season, including the two he belted on opening day Sunday. Not only is that far more than any other pitcher, but on a per-at-bat basis, Bumgarner has homered more frequently than all but 16 position players over the same span. Put him in the Derby! [Baseball-Reference.com]

23 points
Game-leading scoring total for South Carolina’s A’ja Wilson in the NCAA women’s championship Sunday night. As the Gamecocks were closing out their 67-55 victory over Mississippi State, Wilson carried the team on her shoulders with 7 points, 3 rebounds and 2 blocks in the fourth quarter. Afterwards, she was named the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. [NCAA]

40 triple-doubles
Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook has recorded 40 triple-doubles during the 2016-17 NBA season, his most recent being a 40-point, 13-rebound and 10-assist performance against the Charlotte Hornets Sunday. Westbrook is now just one triple-double shy of tying Oscar Robertson’s all-time single-season record of 41; he also needs to record just 29 assists and 11 rebounds over the Thunder’s remaining six games to guarantee he’ll join Robertson as the only players to average a triple-double for an entire season. [CBS Sports]

62 percent
Gonzaga’s odds of beating North Carolina in the NCAA men’s basketball championship Monday night, according to the FiveThirtyEight model. The Bulldogs are making their first-ever title-game appearance, while UNC is on appearance No. 11 (including a buzzer-beating loss just last year). But the stats give a clear edge to the Zags, who — according to the ratings of numbers whiz Ken Pomeroy — play the toughest defense in the country. [FiveThirtyEight]

111 wins
That’s the number of consecutive victories the Connecticut Huskies had reeled off going into the NCAA women’s tournament semifinal Friday night. But all great streaks have to end sometime, and UConn’s was snapped when Mississippi State’s Morgan William sank a game-winning jumper at the horn to seal the upset. Despite the loss, though, we should all take a moment or two to appreciate what Connecticut accomplished: From what we can tell, 111 straight victories is the longest winning streak a true team sport ever produced in college history. [FiveThirtyEight]

CORRECTION (April 3, 11:39 a.m.): An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the team against which Russell Westbrook collected his 40th triple-double. It was the Charlotte Hornets, not the Utah Jazz.

0 amputations
For the first time since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, deployed American soldiers went a full calendar year without needing a single combat amputation. That’s far down from what was happening during some of the most intense fighting; in 2011, troops received an average of 22 amputations per month. [Denver 7]

One-third of plays
Spring is slowly springing, and that means baseball season is upon us. Our venerable national pastime is still evolving, and my colleagues explored some of its recent developments. Looming among them: the dramatic rise of the defensive shift. The strategy was used on nearly a third of all balls in play last season. The batters who face the shift the most have suffered, and my colleagues predict we haven’t seen the last of its rise. [FiveThirtyEight]

1.5 meter debris shield
Two veteran astronauts — Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough — were on a planned spacewalk outside of the International Space Station when the debris shield they were installing floated away into the cold distance of space. The shield, meant to protect against micrometeorites, is now one of “21,000 other pieces of orbiting trash and debris” that can be tracked from Earth. NASA claims it poses no threat to the astronauts or the $100 billion craft. [The Guardian]

9 followers
On Wednesday, during a dinner outside D.C., FBI director James Comey revealed that he had a secret Instagram account with “nine followers.” On Thursday, Gizmodo writer Ashley Feinberg, after a cool bit of internet investigation, claimed to have found it. The account in question was named after Reinhold Niebuhr, a theologian about whom Comey had written a senior thesis. If it was Comey, he in fact had 10 followers, but had made a staggering 3,226 posts. [Gizmodo]

6,620 manatees
The manatee — that noble sea cow, magnificent creature of the shallows — is no longer an endangered species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service downgraded the animals from “endangered” to “threatened” thanks to an annual count that found 6,620 of them luxuriating in Florida waters. But not everyone is happy about the news. The executive director of Save the Manatee Club lamented the reduced protections that would follow and said that the reclassification would “seriously undermine the chances of securing the manatee’s long-term survival.” [Miami Herald]

250,000 vehicles
Roughly 250,000 vehicles drive through a stretch of I-85 in traffic-laden Atlanta every day. On Thursday, a 100-foot-long elevated section of that interstate collapsed, and ten of its lanes will be “closed for the foreseeable future.” The cause of the collapse was a massive fire, but no injuries were reported.

Two allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison over their involvement in politically motivated traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge. Bridget Anne Kelly was sentenced to a year and a half in prison and Bill Baroni was sentenced to two years. Both will have to perform community service and pay thousands of dollars in fines and restitution. [Bloomberg]

A three-term member of Congress has stepped forward to be the Democrat who loses the Texas Senate race in 2018. Rep. Beto O’Rourke plans to announce on Friday his candidacy to challenge incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, continuing the Texas tradition of bold Democrats laying down their careers to pose a moderate speed bump for a Republican’s waltz to victory. [The Houston Chronicle]

4 years
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature may have agreed on a bill that would overturn House Bill 2, the law that barred city-level LGBT discrimination protections and forced transgender people to use the public bathroom of their birth sex. The new bill would put a four-year moratorium on new city ordinances protecting LGBT rights; LGBT advocates say the deal will “continue to actively discriminate against the LGBT community.” [The News & Observer]

35 minutes
SB Nation compared two virtually identical baseball games — 11-2 final score, 27 baserunners, about 270 pitches, about 75 batters — but one took place in 1984 and the other in 2014. The 2014 game, like many baseball games these days, was way too long, a full 35 minutes longer than the 2 hour 31 minute outing of 1984. Most of that extra time came from the time between pitches getting longer. [SB Nation]

68 contenders
To cap off Mars Month here at FiveThirtyEight, we ran Mars Madness, where we pitted 68 Martian missions and planetary features in a head-to-head bracket voted on by readers. My personal favorite — Korabl 11, a satellite that the U.S. government thought was an intercontinental ballistic missile as it crashed into earth — did not do well, but the Curiosity rover did.

The Isle of Wight council called for the public to suggest names for a new floating bridge. That, naturally, led to a petition — which as of Tuesday had received more than 1,600 signatures — to name the ferry-like structure “Floaty McFloatface.” After initially vetoing the suggestion, the council now says it will consider it.

Generally, kids in the U.S. go to kindergarten when they’re five years old, but around 20 percent of U.S. kindergarteners begin at six, some of them because their parents held them back a year because of perceived advantages to waiting. That perception is backed up by one study that found postponing kindergarten led to more self control. But honestly, “study finds solution to immaturity is aging slightly” is a worse headline. [Quartz]

6 championships
It’s been one year since North Carolina Republicans passed HB2, a bill that banned cities from extending legal protections to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. It has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of economic losses and remains on the books. The NCAA — which moved March Madness games out of the state in reaction to the law — is considering where to hold six years’ worth of championship games next month. If North Carolina wants to be in that conversation, the clock is ticking for the GOP legislative supermajority and new Democratic governor to cut a deal. [POLITICO]

22 votes
House Speaker Paul Ryan can afford to lose only 22 GOP votes in any attempt to pass House Republicans’ bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. President Trump’s budget director said Thursday that today is the last day for the House to pass the bill before the president gives up and moves on to other priorities. The vote was supposed to be Thursday night anyway, so let’s see how this goes. [POLITICO]

25 trips
Because of travel restrictions proposed by President Trump, the Toronto District School Board will not approve new trips to the United States out of concern for students being turned away at the border.

149 spotlights
The Germans have used 149 spotlights to make an artificial sun that produces light that is 10,000 times stronger than natural sunlight on Earth. They can produce temperatures of 3,500 Celsius by directing them at a single spot. Listen, I’m not saying they made a death ray, I’m just saying they made a scientific device that shares a lot of death-ray-esque properties — and I think we need to have a more open conversation about the death-ray potential here, because I’m not 100 percent cool with a fake sun in a protective radiation chamber after seeing “Spider-Man 2.” [The Guardian]

Share of Republicans who do not believe gay and lesbian people face a lot of discrimination in the U.S. Interestingly, more Republicans believed that Christians — who make up more than 70 percent of the population — face a lot of discrimination than believed that gays and lesbians, black Americans, immigrants and Muslims do. [Public Religion Research Institute]

78 percent
A report from the research firm eMarketer found that Google and Facebook are solidifying and even expanding their dominance of the digital advertising market. Google will account for 78 percent of search ad revenue in 2017, while Facebook will get 39 percent of display ad revenue. Everyone else — including the newly public parent company of Snapchat — is fighting over the scraps. [Axios]

$100 million
Congratulations to Jordan Peele, whose hit film “Get Out” became the first debut for an African-American writer-director to gross more than $100 million at the box office. [The Wrap]

CORRECTION (March 15, 2:43 p.m.): An earlier version of this story gave the wrong name for Jordan Peele’s new film. It is “Get Out,” not “The Get Out.”

3 years
When you are Richard Simmons, your fans notice when you fall off the radar. It has been three years since the fitness guru stopped showing up to teach his fitness classes, which has given rise to a long list of rumors and conspiracy theories, including that he is being held hostage by his housekeeper. (Simmons, through his publicist, has denied that and other stories.) A new podcast is exploring the many mysteries regarding Simmons’s disappearance. [The New York Times]

5 days
Why build a house of ice when the weather does it for you? After five days of heavy winds and subzero temperatures, a home in Webster, New York, near Lake Ontario, became encased in ice. Considering the heavy snowfall on the East Coast right now, we could see some impressive igloos to rival the ice house. [The Huffington Post]

$100
Texas state Rep. Jessica Farrar is proposing legislation that would fine men $100 for masturbating and require a 24-hour waiting period for buying Viagra. Farrar introduced the bill, which she calls “A Man’s Right to Know Act,” as a way to call attention to the limited access and strict regulations that women face in getting abortions in Texas. [CNN]

217 weapons
Authorities broke up an alleged weapons trafficking ring after an undercover cop in New York City purchased 217 firearms that had been illegally transported to Brooklyn from Virginia, where gun laws aren’t as strict. So far, 24 people have been arrested in connection with the gun ring. [ABC News]

217 minutes and 14 seconds
A hockey playoff game in Norway went to eight overtimes this weekend, meaning the two teams were on the ice for 217 minutes and 14 seconds. The three-and-a-half hours of playing time translated into more than eight hours of total time for fans, some of whom were reported missing by loved ones. The game is now considered the longest ever in hockey. And we thought the game of baseball was too slow. [NHL]

24 million people
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people would lose their health insurance by 2026 under the American Health Care Act, congressional Republicans’ proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act. If enacted, the AHCA would cut the federal deficit by $337 billion over 10 years but would push the share of Americans without insurance coverage back to pre-ACA levels, according to the CBO.

1 hour
Some business owners in the Northeast question whether we should adjust our clocks for daylight saving time and are urging their states to join a different time zone. A New York Times op-ed writer suggests having a single time zone. So does this mean we agree to abolish “spring forward” in favor of getting back that hour of sleep we lost this weekend? [The New York Times, The New York Times]

28 years old
Happy 28th birthday, World Wide Web! You’ve come a long way. But before the cake and ice cream, Tim Berners-Lee, who created you, would like a word with us. He’s concerned about three threats: a lack of control over personal data, misinformation and a lack of transparency in political advertising. We are, too. [Quartz]

46 U.S. attorneys
The Trump administration asked for the resignation of 46 U.S. attorneys, including New York’s Preet Bharara, on Friday. The next day, Bharara said via Twitter that he had been fired after refusing to resign. [The Washington Post]

800 copies
It’s not unusual to own two copies of your favorite vinyl. I’m guilty of this. But Mark Satlof owns more than 800 copies of “The Velvet Underground and Nico,” which is equivalent to about 1 percent of all copies made before 1969. You could call him a die-hard Velvet Underground fan. [NPR]

235,000 jobs
On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the addition of 235,000 jobs to the U.S. economy and an unemployment rate that dropped slightly to 4.7 percent in February. But as FiveThirtyEight’s chief economics writer Ben Casselman explains, these numbers shouldn’t be attributed to President Trump’s economic policies. [FiveThirtyEight]

$854,000 in damage
Radioactive boars, contaminated as a result of the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011, are causing havoc in parts of Japan — they’ve done about $854,000 in agricultural damage in Fukushima prefecture. Officials are even worried that the boars will attack people who are returning home to towns that were evacuated. So, that’s horrifying. [The New York Times]

Edith Fuller goes to Washington. The 5-year-old from Tulsa will be heading to D.C. for the Scripps National Spelling Bee. She’s the youngest ever to qualify for the nation’s premier phonemic orthographic competition, which will be held in late May and early June.

38 Trump trademarks
The Chinese government has preliminarily approved 38 Trump trademarks, which cover hotels, golf clubs and concierge services. While a director at a Hong Kong intellectual property outfit told the Associated Press that he’d never seen so many trademark applications approved so quickly, any special treatment in trademark rights received by President Trump would violate the U.S. Constitution, experts said.

303 counties
A$AP Rocky, one of the great musical geniuses of our time, told us in his 2011 track “Purple Swag” that “everything is purple.” David Wasserman, writing for this website, disagrees. Purple America — those counties that don’t vote super red or super blue — is disappearing. In fact, of the nation’s 3,113 counties (or county equivalents), only 303 were decided by single-digit percentage points in the most recent presidential election. In contrast, 1,096 counties were purple by that standard in the 1992 election. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,000-to-1 odds
Last month, the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, besting the Atlanta Falcons. This was quite a surprise, at least when the fourth quarter started given Atlanta’s 28-9 lead. But just how big a surprise depends on the model you looked at. Some projections put New England’s chances at their nadir at 25-1, while others had them as 1,000-1 dogs. As the statistician George Box is often credited with saying: “All models are wrong but some are useful.” [StatsbyLopez]

20,669 words
On their face, the iTunes terms and conditions don’t really make for engrossing reading. But the 20,669-word document has, overcoming somewhere between 25-1 and 1,000-1 odds, been transformed into the “year’s hottest graphic novel,” in an adaptation by the author Robert Sikoryak. The late Steve Jobs appears on each page of the book, as a famous comic book character, rattling off the dense legalese. [The Guardian]

RadioShack is reportedly preparing to seek bankruptcy protection. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it happened last year as well. This would be RadioShack’s second bankruptcy filing in two years.

1.5 million potential voters
Number of Turks living in Germany who are eligible to vote in Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey wants those expats to vote in favor of a new Constitution that would give him more power, and Germany’s leadership — which is dealing with a number of geopolitical issues regarding Turkey — would vastly prefer he did not get those powers. As The Times put it: “Mr. Erdogan’s opponents in Germany, both Turkish and German, say the president wants to use the freedoms of Western democracy to further consolidate his anti-democratic powers at home.” [The New York Times]

The case revolved around a Colorado man convicted of sexual battery and a juror who made derogatory comments about Mexicans during the deliberations. Those comments came to light only after the verdict. [USA Today]

7 GOP senators
House Republicans have introduced their version of an Affordable Care Act repeal. It involves scrapping the individual mandate, rolling back the Medicaid expansion and overhauling the way tax credits are awarded. It’s complicated stuff, and just the first bid in what’s likely to be a long negotiation. Indeed, seven GOP senators have taken issue with the House bill — four who said the bill didn’t adequately protect constituents benefitting from Medicaid, and three who took the conservative line that the bill was too generous. [The New York Times, Vox]

For comparison, the International Space Station is 15,000 cubic feet, and even thats a bit of a tin can. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,000 coins
A green sea turtle in Thailand is recovering after undergoing surgery on Monday to remove the nearly 1,000 coins it had consumed. The turtle lived in a pool in Sri Racha where tourists would throw coins for luck. Approximately 11 pounds of metal were removed. “It is hard to imagine how it swallowed such a large number of coins,” said an extremely judgmental veterinarian who apparently has never heard of stress eating.

14 states
Number of states that require students to reach proficiency in cursive writing, which seems dumb and vestigial. Still, that number is on the rise. Realistically, kids need to learn cursive only because people still write in cursive — we’d teach them Teeline if speed was really the goal. In any case, I think proficiency is a bit too far; maybe require students to reach the “able to sign things” level of capability and leave it at that. [Associated Press]

25 movies
Licensed toys — that is, toys tied to a movie or some other major piece of intellectual property — are a massive chunk of the roughly $20 billion toy business, representing about 30 percent of it in a given year. And this year, the licensed toy market should be huge: About 25 films will have toy tie-ins in 2017, compared to seven or eight in a typical year. [Bloomberg]

This dichotomy has made the cow-milk people mad, and now they’re claiming that almond milk — which has proven it is the growth commodity — doesn’t deserve to carry the name milk. [Buzzfeed]

$1,395
Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself yesterday from any investigation the Justice Department carries out regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The announcement came a day after the revelation Sessions had met with the Russian ambassador twice in the course of the campaign despite testifying to Congress he hadn’t. Sessions brushed off the concerns, indicating that the two meetings had nothing to do with the campaign and instead pertained to official government business. Which is cool, but then why, when in Cleveland for the RNC, where he met with the ambassador, did Sessions make two payments of $1,395 to a Sheraton hotel from his campaign account and not his Senate account?

On one hand, these are the same people who want to get the tax repealed, and we don’t have hard numbers yet, so take this with a grain of salt. On the other hand, the whole point of the tax is to reduce consumption of stuff that will kill you anyway, so … good job? [Philly.com]

1 bull
A bull escaped a slaughterhouse in the New York City borough of Queens on Tuesday morning, leading to a chase. The beast was eventually captured, and now it’s dead. What? It’s not like it was two llamas, people. It was always going to end like this. [The New York Times]

40 percent
Drop in costs for batteries since 2014; global energy-storage capacity is forecast to grow to 15 times current levels by 2024. Giant batteries appear to be the future. [Bloomberg]

2,926
Number of reported incidents of drug loss or theft at federal hospitals in 2015, up from 272 in 2009. Not a typo. Geez, we need to get this national opioid thing handled. [The Associated Press]

6,687
Number of eligible voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group that on Tuesday finished voting on who’s going to win Oscars this Sunday. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.16 trillion

3.5 percent
The Trump administration will project gross domestic product growth of 3 to 3.5 percent a year when touting the economic impacts of proposed legislation, which is considerably higher than estimates from independent and nonpartisan agencies as well as private-sector economic forecasters. Recent economic growth has been around 2 percent, and economists consider growth above 3 percent very difficult to sustain. [The Wall Street Journal]

14 percent
A Johns Hopkins University, Harvard and Boston Children’s Hospital study found that suicide attempts of lesbian, gay and bisexual teenagers dropped 14 percent when their state legalized same-sex marriage. [The Guardian]

277 egregious errors
Columbia University accidentally sent out acceptance emails to 277 prospective graduate students, which it later rescinded. One would think a university typically considered prestigious would be capable of sending an email, but alas, Columbia joins MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Tulane, Fordham and more in the club of universities that have screwed this up. [The New York Times]

5,500 pounds
SpaceX successfully launched nearly 5,500 pounds of supplies bound for the International Space Station and subsequently recovered the spent rocket booster Sunday at Cape Canaveral in Florida. [The Guardian]

$4 billion
Amount spent by Coca-Cola on advertising last year. The company is changing the My Coke Rewards program — those codes inside of bottle caps — and the dedicated group of rewards program obsessives is freaking out. [Bloomberg]

$143 billion
Kraft Heinz Co. is walking away from a $143 billion bid to buy Unilever after Unilever indicated that it was hella not cool with that. [Reuters]

4.8 percent
A Color of Change study examining 234 television shows has found that only 4.8 percent of the 3,817 staff writers were black. Indeed, two-thirds of television shows didn’t employ a single black writer. [The Hollywood Reporter]

23 percent
That’s the percentage of food waste that qualifies as prepared foods and leftovers, the second-highest source of trashed food (inedible food parts are number one). Turns out that Americans aren’t eating leftovers anymore, which could pose a bit of a waste management problem. [The Washington Post]

63 percent
An American Psychological Association study found that 63 percent of Americans are stressed about the future of the nation, a concern beating out both money and work stressors, and one that cuts across partisan lines. Grimly, 59 percent consider it the lowest point in the nation’s history they can recall, a figure that holds regardless of generation. [Bloomberg]

2030
It’s projected that by 2030 Catholics will become a religious minority in Brazil. One contributing cause to this is the rise of Pentecostal churches throughout Latin America and Africa: a quarter of Brazilians are Pentecostal, and that number is going up. One American export — the prosperity gospel, which says the more money you give to the church the more money you will get back — is selling very well in Brazil. [The Washington Post]

33,500 mining jobs
That’s the number of mining jobs lost in the Appalachian region since 2011, and how to fix that job deficit is a bit of catch-22. Due to the price of coal relative to the price of other ways to make power, it’s unlikely that the market is going to require 33,500 more people to mine coal. One solution is to retrain miners for other jobs, but herein lies the pickle: On one hand, why would miners enter retraining courses when there are no immediate job prospects near their home in the new discipline? On the other, why would employers who need trained employees move to a place where there are no such trained employees? This chicken and egg problem is making it difficult to help improve the economy of coal country through retraining. [Reuters]

$4.5 trillion balance sheet
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has raised borrowing costs four times since 2015, and she has begun to reduce the amount of money on the Fed’s balance sheet (a cool $4.5 trillion as of this summer). That work appears like it will be continued by Jerome Powell, reportedly President Trump’s pick for the chair. [Bloomberg]

3 members
One Direction will join The Beatles as the only bands that can say three of their members have chart-topping solo albums. Thus “Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Zayne Malik are right up there with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison,” is a technically true sentence that has been weaponized to alienate Baby Boomers. More significantly, my personal quest to find out who was the Ringo of 1D has narrowed to two final contenders, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson. I still contend Harry Styles is the McCartney, as he just screams “overrated Bond song in a few years.” [Variety]

16.2 percent
That’s the percentage of visitors to Uluru — the Australian geological formation previously known as Ayer’s Rock — who climb it on a given day. Starting in October 2019, the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board will ban the practice of climbing the formation, which has spiritual meaning for some Aboriginal Australians. [Business Insider Australia]

30 years
Carles Puigdemont was the president of Catalonia, the region that attempted to break away from Spain. Spain’s Attorney General has called for charges of sedition and rebellion to be filed against Puigdemont and his fellow secessionists. This would carry a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison. Puigdemont has since fled to Belgium. [Vox]

63 percent
The Cato Institute is out with a staggering new report on the state of free speech in the United States. One disconcerting trend: 11 percent of Democrats, 38 percent of independents and 63 percent of Republicans said they believed that journalists today are an enemy of the American people. Yeesh. [Cato]

97 out of 25,000 establishments
That’s the number of eating and drinking establishments in New York City that have a cabaret license, which is a city document that allows the establishment to host “musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement” without running afoul of the law. This technically means that you probably can’t dance in that bar you thought you could dance in, legally speaking. The law dates back to 1926, back when a couple good-time Charlies and floorflushers couldn’t jitterbug with some flappers in a standard nosebaggery without risking a trip to the hoosegow, you see? But now people in Brooklyn want to dance at bars and the law looks like it will likely get struck down by the City Council. [The New York Times]

620,000
Wall Street has dumped billions of dollars into restaurants to fuel growth, and we probably have too many restaurants as a result: restaurants are growing twice as fast as the population, tallying 620,000 establishments as of the last count. But demand does not expand just because supply does̉. When you get down to it, the invisible hand of the market can only shove one burger into the invisible face of the market at a given time.

6 service members
On Monday, a U.S. district court judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration’s plan to ban transgender service members from serving in the armed forces. There are already significant numbers of trans Americans serving, and six active-duty service members sued in August to block the policy. [The Washington Post]

14 percent
Approval rating for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey according to a new Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll. If that poll is accurate, it would nudge Christie further into the record books: he’s currently the third most unpopular governor for whom polls can be found. [Harry Enten, Suffolk University, FiveThirtyEight]

33 percent
The Gallup tracking survey released Monday had the president’s approval rating at 33 percent, a new low. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 percent
Facebook’s new attempt to have third-party fact checking groups vet the content the company spreads on news feeds hasn’t been going well, according to a new report from Bloomberg. When two fact checking groups flag an item as false it tags the link as “disputed,” which cuts the number of people who see the hoax or misinformation by about 80 percent. However, this has only happened for around 2,000 links, a small fraction of the hundreds of potentially false stories screeners see every day. Factor in that the process typically takes over three days, and you’re not exactly mitigating the spread of false information. [Bloomberg]

$10 million
Federal prosecutors are asking for a $10 million bail to be set for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and $5 million for Rick Gates. Both men pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Monday. Manafort is a wealthy man with allegedly millions of dollars in offshore accounts, according to information detailed in the indictment. [FiveThirtyEight, The Washington Post]

126 million people
That’s Facebook’s estimate for the number of people who may have seen content spread by a Kremlin-linked troll farm between June 2015 and August 2017. The content was intended to spread divisive political messaging on topics including LGBT rights, race issues and gun rights. [CNN Money]

2 indictments
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election has produced its first two indictments Monday. Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Rick Gates, Manafort’s former business partner, are expected to turn themselves in. FiveThirtyEight will have ongoing coverage of the indictments, and the political fallout, all day. [FiveThirtyEight]

9.9 percent
Constellation Brands, the U.S. distributor of Corona beer, will take a 9.9 percent stake in Canopy Growth Corp., a marijuana company based in Canada that is now the largest publicly traded pot company. [The Wall Street Journal]

161 people
It’s been only a few weeks since a mass shooting in Las Vegas claimed the lives of 58 people, and the road to recovery is still long for the 161 people who survived despite being shot. In addition to those who suffered injuries related to trampling, some people will spend the rest of their lives in a wheelchair as a result of bullet wounds sustained in the shooting. [The New York Times]

15 million square feet
That’s the amount of office space being added in Manhattan between 2017 and 2019 according to a new report from the New York Building Congress. A further 2 million square feet going up in Brooklyn and Queens in the same time period. Right now Midtown Manhattan is enjoying a rent decrease as the market absorbs new supply and more competition. [Bloomberg]

$300 million
Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cancelled a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, a tiny firm that has ties to the Trump administration. About 70 percent of Puerto Rico remains without power in the wake of hurricanes hitting the U.S. territory. [The Huffington Post]

$800 billion
Since its first day of trading ten years ago, PetroChina Co., a state-owned energy producer and the first trillion-dollar company on Earth, has lost $800 billion worth of market value. It’s the largest ever destruction of shareholder wealth in dollar terms. The shares are expected to decline 16 percent over the next 12 months. [Bloomberg]

20 deals
Less than 15 percent of first-look producer deals with the six major studios are with production companies led by women, a new report from Variety found. Out of 139 such deals — in which the studio pays overhead and provides some cash in exchange for first dibs on the film — only 20 were with companies helmed by women. That number has barely changed recently. [Variety]

1 interstellar visitor
We have a visitor! Late Thursday, astronomers announced that they’ve spotted a space rock from another star cruising through our solar system. It’s the first time we’ve caught an interstellar asteroid or comet visiting the neighborhood. Scientists are provisionally calling the object A/2017 U1. They’re not sure if it’s mostly rock or ice yet, but it’s about a half-kilometer in size and flying at just over 40 kilometers per second. [Scientific American]

40 nuclear reactors
Wind power generation in Germany is predicted to go nuts on Sunday, reaching a projected 39,190 megawatts at 7 a.m.. That’s roughly 40 nuclear reactors worth of power. [Bloomberg]

95,000 workers
United Parcel Service is adding 95,000 seasonal workers for the holidays. The company expects holiday season deliveries will rise 5 percent, to 750 million, this time around. On an average day, UPS handles 19 million packages, a figure that roughly doubles around the holidays. [Bloomberg]

$900 million
Next year, the Smithsonian Institution will begin a seven-year, $900 million total renovation of the National Air and Space Museum. The first new exhibits are planned to open in 2021. Construction will cost $650 million, and new exhibits will cost $250 million. The museum cost $40 million to build in the first place, in the 1970s (roughly $176 million in today’s dollars). [The Washington Business Journal]

More than 20 Republicans
Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey has raised a red flag on GOP plans to eliminate the state and local income tax deduction as part of their tax reform plan. Deducting state and local taxes disproportionately benefits constituents in states that have higher state and local taxes, such as New York and New Jersey. MacArthur estimates that there are more than 20 Republicans in the House opposed to getting rid of the deduction, and they’re making noise about voting against a budget resolution scheduled to come up Thursday that would pave the way for tax reform. [Bloomberg]

45 states
Walgreens is now stocking an FDA-approved nasal form of naloxone in all of its pharmacies nationwide. Naloxone reverses the effects of opioids and can stymie an overdose. The drug, Narcan, is obtainable without a prescription in 45 states. [The Daily Herald]

70 percent
Vaping is becoming illegal indoors in the entirety of New York State. Previously, 70 percent of municipalities had banned the use of electronic cigarettes inside. The remaining 30 percent will now get to go to the mall in peace, without a bunch of teenagers blowing plumes of nicotine-laced, apple-berry-popcorn vapor into their faces. At least cigarette smoke had the decency of dissipating rather than remaining fog-like at sidewalk level. [BBC]

$70
A National Parks Service proposal would raise the cost to drive into a national park from $25-$30 to $70, as well as double the cost for people entering the park on foot. The proposal would apply to 17 national parks during the 2018 peak season. [CNN]

0 Standing Committee members
China’s new Politburo Standing Committee was revealed on Tuesday, with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang the only two holdovers and five new ministers. Two interesting things to note: First, this is the first time that the Standing Committee has zero members born before the 1949 Communist revolution. Second, there is no obvious successor to Xi among the group. [Reuters]

20 months
“Geostorm,” the timeless story of a globe-spanning natural disaster and the attractive man (Gerard Butler) who tried to stop it, tanked at the box office. It hauled in just $14.7 million domestically and $66.8 million worldwide on a budget of $120 million (including $15 million for reshoots). This is a huge disappointment. To begin with, “Geostorm” was initially scheduled for release nearly 20 months ago. Also, its break-even point is upwards of $300 million, which by my calculations is way bigger than $67 million. [The Wrap]

38 percent
Sen. Jeff Flake announced yesterday that he would not seek re-election. That doesn’t mean a ton for the U.S. Senate race in Arizona in 2018 — at least not yet. It’s still perhaps the Democrats’ best pickup opportunity in the upcoming midterms, although still not a slam dunk. A HighGround Public Affairs survey found likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kyrsten Sinema slightly ahead of potential GOP nominee Kelli Ward, 32 percent to 31 percent, but with 38 percent of respondents still undecided. [FiveThirtyEight]

49.8 percent
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of Boston’s forthcoming mayoral election found that half of respondents had personally met Mayor Marty Walsh. Retail politics still means something up there, it would appear. Which is nice … I’ve never met New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. [The Boston Globe]

51 votes
With Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote, Senate Republicans successfully passed legislation killing a rule that would have allowed Americans to form class-action lawsuits against banks and credit card companies. The rule was created after the 2008 financial crisis to combat arbitration clauses inserted into contracts that prevented people from pooling resources and suing financial institutions in class-action suits. It was set to take effect in 2019. [The New York Times]

247 million hectoliters of wine
Catastrophe: The planet will produce only 247 million hectoliters of wine, one of the better things that Earth manages to make, this year. That’s the lowest production level in more than 50 years, and down 8 percent from last year. Extreme weather in the three nations that produce the most wine is to blame. [BBC]

7.4 feet or more
A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that floods of at least 7.4 feet could hit the New York area once every five years from 2030 to 2045. Floods of that magnitude hit New York about once every 25 years now. (Before 1800, they hit once every 500 years.) [Bloomberg]

40 percent
After Purdue Pharmaceuticals — which is partially owned by the secretive Sackler family — changed the formulation of OxyContin pills to make them more difficult to grind into an even-more-abusable powder, prescriptions apparently fell by 40 percent. The explosion of OxyContin use has fueled a devastating opiate epidemic in the United States, and if plans to market the drug abroad succeed, potentially other parts of the world too. [The New Yorker]

45 comments
A military judge will soon decide the fate of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and President Trump’s comments about Bergdahl may have some bearing on that decision. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in 2009 after leaving his base under questionable circumstances. He has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. His counsel, though, has made a renewed push for the case to be dismissed, raising questions about whether Bergdahl received a fair trial given that Trump has called him a traitor on at least 45 different occasions. [NPR]

61 percent
Percentage of Americans who think John F. Kennedy was not killed by Lee Harvey Oswald alone, according to a SurveyMonkey poll conducted for FiveThirtyEight. Later this week, a final batch of government documents related to the assassination may be released. These will presumably prove my theory: The CIA — which was invented by the Mafia with the dual goals of making frogs gay and also rigging the 1985 NBA draft lottery — foiled simultaneous Communist and anti-Communist assassination plots orchestrated by the original Paul McCartney to cover up the truth that Magneto did it. Or maybe it was Oswald. [FiveThirtyEight]

$149 song
A Canadian man was reportedly slapped with a $149 (Canadian dollars) ticket for screaming in public after he was pulled over singing along to “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory at what most would consider a perfectly acceptable volume. [CTV News]

162 candidates
In a third-quarter fundraising performance that’s getting attention from both sides of the aisle, at least 162 Democratic congressional candidates competing in 82 districts currently held by a Republican have raised over $100,000 so far. That’s a solid gauge for aggregate candidate quality this early in the cycle, and is about four times as many well-funded candidates as Democrats had at the same point in the 2016 and 2014 election cycles. It’s twice as many as Republicans fielded at the same point in the 2010 cycle that swept them into power in the House. [POLITICO]

3 warm winters
NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center released its winter temperature forecast and it appears that most of the U.S. is poised for a warmer-than-usual winter. Should that pan out, this will be the third warmer-than-average winter in a row. [NPR]

24-hour ready alert
For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the Air Force is reportedly making preparations to put its nuclear-armed B-52 bombers back on a 24-hour alert posture. That includes the installation of new beds for more than 100 crew members. [Defense One]

43 percent
Percentage of people who took the California bar exam in July, 2016, who passed, compared to nearly 62 percent in 2008. California’s minimum score of 144 is the second highest in the country, and law school deans want it lowered to be more in line with other states. [AP News]

56 percent
A new class action lawsuit against General Electric alleges that the company managed its 401(k) plan to benefit itself, steering employees into funds that were managed by a subsidiary. Those funds charged high fees and went on to underperform investment markets. As The Los Angeles Times wrote, “Of the retirement plan’s $28.5 billion in assets as of the end of 2015, the lawsuit asserts, about half was invested in mutual funds. Of the mutual fund assets, about 56% were invested in five GE-owned funds — all but one of which underperformed its benchmark investment index.” [The Los Angeles Times]

$10 million
Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is dropping “well over $10 million” on a nationwide television ad campaign calling for President Trump’s impeachment. Steyer is also considering mounting a primary campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year. [CNN]

$32 million
On Friday, The New York Times reported a previously unknown settlement between Bill O’Reilly and a network analyst who accused him of harassment, sharing sexually explicit material and a “nonconsensual sexual relationship.” The settlement — the sixth we now know of involving O’Reilly and largest — was for $32 million, and occurred just about a month before Fox renewed his contract for $25 million a year for four years.

Apple shares dropped nearly 3 percent on reports that wireless carriers were not selling as many iPhone 8s as they had expected and claims in Taiwanese media that production on the phone had been cut by half. [Reuters, 9to5 Mac]

17 percent
Percentage of United Airlines revenue that comes from markets where low-cost carriers operate, one reason cited in the stock’s 17 percent tank this year. Airlines like Delta and American have seen 6 percent and 10 percent gains, respectively. Oh, hey, maybe — and I am just throwing this out there — a medical professional getting beaten up and forcibly removed from a flight wasn’t a brilliant business move either. [CNBC]

1.25 percent
A bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers has introduced the most Colorado legislation possible: the Keeping Our Manufacturers from Being Unfairly Taxed while Championing Health Act, or KOMBUCHA for short. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and Scott Tipton (R-Colo.) are responsible for this hippie nonsense making its way into Congress. Kombucha, a kind of fermented tea, is naturally slightly alcoholic — its alcohol by volume sometimes reaches 1 percent. Unfortunately, that’s above the 0.5 percent it takes to be taxed as booze. This bill raises the threshold of 1.25 percent alcohol. [Rep. Jared Polis]

$25 million
Daniel Lubetzky, the chief executive of the company that makes KIND bars, is contributing $25 million over the next decade to fund a group working to counteract the influence that huge food producers have on government nutrition policy. Lubetzky got interested in the issue when he learned that the government won’t let companies label foods like tree nuts and salmon as “healthy.” [The Washington Post]

1 cockroach
Zoo Atlanta has named one of their newest baby animals after quarterback Tom Brady, the result of a lost Super Bowl bet with the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island (deep in New England Patriots territory). The animal that the zoo selected is a Madagascar hissing cockroach. Just so I don’t get a bunch of emails from New Englanders again, you can have, “I suppose none of their GOATs were pregnant” for free to use in your everyday life as a riposte. [Click 2 Houston]

3.5
Scientists have long thought that female sea turtles lay an average of about 3.5 clutches of eggs per year. Now new research suggests the true number may be twice as high. Scientists count clutches (or, technically, tracks leading to clutches) to estimate the turtle population, so the news, if confirmed, could mean there are half as many of the endangered reptiles as previously believed.

In a 51-page decision, three judges at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board have ruled that the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT owns the lucrative patents for gene editing technology CRISPR-Cas9. The University of California had challenged the patent, arguing that Broad’s technology was essentially a logical extension of UC scientists’ work. As far as academic fights go, this is Ali-Frazier and worth a read. [STAT News]

Share of Americans ages 25 to 35 who moved over the past year. That’s a lot lower than previous generations: In 2000 26 percent of the cohort had moved recently. In 1990, it was 27 percent. I would try to find the time to figure out why, but I’ll have to consult my student loan company about whether I can afford to do so. [Bloomberg]

That was the runway pilot and actor Harrison Ford was supposed to land on at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. Instead he landed on the taxiway and flew just over American Airways flight 1456. Just a note, if you ever have to ask, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” someone screwed up. [NBC News]

After serving in the role for 24 whole days, former general Michael Flynn has stepped down as President Trump’s national security adviser.

48 percent
A new poll found that the three left-of-center German political parties would win a combined 48 percent of the vote in forthcoming parliamentary elections. That would be enough to win the contest, build a government and oust Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats from power. [Reuters]

288.93 boxes
Citrus greening disease is making for more watery oranges, which means producers of orange juice need to crush more oranges to make the same amount of O.J. concentrate. It used to be that producers needed about 250 boxes of oranges to make one ton of concentrated juice. In the Brazilian orange season that began in July, watery oranges meant it took 288.93 boxes to produce one ton of juice. [Bloomberg]

100,000 people
More than 100,000 people in Northern California were told to evacuate their homes Sunday after authorities became concerned that an emergency spillway at the nation’s tallest dam was on the verge of failure. Water began flowing over the spillway at the Oroville Dam for the first time in its nearly 50-year history on Saturday, threatening to flood downstream towns. On Sunday night, authorities said the lake level had dropped, reducing the risk. [The Associated Press, The Los Angeles Times]

Historically, whoever wins those awards at the BAFTAs has tended to win them at the Oscars. If Casey Affleck takes home the BAFTA, he’ll go into the Academy Awards as the favorite for best actor. Same with Natalie Portman or frontrunner Emma Stone in best actress. A BAFTA win is worth 63 points in our Oscars tracker. [FiveThirtyEight]

91.7 pounds per person
Americans love chicken. This year, each American is projected to eat around 91.7 pounds of chicken, on average. That’s up 9 percent since 2010. But making all that chicken happen is an elaborate and — according to a lawsuit — unfair process. The chicken industry is dominated by a few giant poultry processors that buy birds from smaller farmers. And five former chicken farmers in five states have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the big processors of “treating farmers who raise the chickens like indentured servants and colluding to fix prices paid to them.” [The Associated Press]

878° F
It would be really nice if we had lots of pictures of the surface of Venus. You know, like we do with the surface of Mars. Here’s the issue though: Venus is an unfathomable hellhole. It’s 878° F and the atmospheric pressure is incredible. Add in the boiling sulphuric rain and you get a habitat that not even our most robust robots can handle for long. The record for “time spent on Venus without being rendered inoperable by Venus” by a manmade object is 127 minutes. But have faith, we’re starting to invent and build the tech that can tolerate that ecosystem. [Ars Technica]

Many cities and states have raised their minimum wages in recent years, but many of those laws leave at least one group out: tipped workers, such as waiters. Among the states, the gap is most pronounced in Massachusetts, where minimum wage earners make $11 per hour while tipped workers make $3.75 an hour. [FiveThirtyEight]

The jersey Tom Brady wore during his Super Bowl win on Sunday has gone missing, and the Texas Rangers have been called in to investigate (along with the Houston police).

34-28
Preparation, skill and mental toughness all came together last night in an absolute stunner: I successfully made armadillo eggs for my Southwest-infused Super Bowl party, and they had just the right amount of kick without being too overpowering. Oh, also, the New England Patriots won. It was a nutty game. At one point the Pats were down 28-3 against the Atlanta Falcons. And for the first time in Super Bowl history, the game went into overtime. Not my first choice of outcomes, sure, but easily one of the most entertaining NFL games I’ve seen. Also, the key is a little MSG in the spice rub, which adds a savory element to the armadillo egg. [FiveThirtyEight]

25 points
It was really one for the record books: No team has come back from a Super Bowl deficit of more than 10 points, and Tom Brady proved — to my chagrin — that he’s the best quarterback ever. He had more completions, pass attempts and passing yards in a Super Bowl than anyone else, ever. His team ran the most-ever offensive plays in the championship. The Pats put together the biggest comeback — 25 points! — in a Super Bowl ever. It’s the most ridiculous achievement — ever. [ESPN]

2 options
In other news, Puerto Rico will hold a non-binding referendum on June 11 on whether to (a) go for statehood, or (b) pursue independence or free association. If option “a” wins, they’ll pursue statehood. If option “b” wins, Puerto Ricans will vote in October on a second referendum to choose between independence and free association. Also, we’ll get to call it the “Puerto Rexit,” so keep an eye on how this vote goes. [Associated Press]

Hou Yifan, the top-ranked female chess player in the world, threw a game at the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival to protest the “‘unbelievable and weird pairings’ that meant seven of her 10 opponents during the event were women.” Hou, a.k.a. the “Queen of Chess,” who recently left the women’s circuit to compete in mixed events, lost the game in just five moves. [NPR]

Nordstrom Inc. has dropped Ivanka Trump’s brand for this season. The department-store chain said the move was due to poor sales — Nordstrom carries a ton of brands and each year cuts the worst-performing 10 percent. Nieman Marcus also appears to have dropped the brand. It’s possible boycotts of Trump family brands are having an effect. [Bloomberg, Racked]

Queen Elizabeth II is celebrating 65 years on the British throne today.

This Sunday is the Super Bowl. Here’s an unbiased and fundamentally neutral rundown. 

0.52
Since 2001 the New England Patriots have run 0.52 quarterback sneaks on average each game, about one every other week, making them the sneakiest team in the league. While some may construe this as a solid strategy that extends a drive, others like me see it for what it is: even more evidence of the fundamental perfidy of the New England Patriots organization. [FiveThirtyEight]

25 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe that God plays a role in the outcome of sporting events. Moreover, about half of all Americans think that the Almighty rewards athletes who believe and have faith. I hear this, but only because a Pats win this Sunday would all but guarantee the existence and work of Satan on earth for me, you know? [PRRI]

26 extra catches
The Atlanta Falcons will rely on star receiver Julio Jones to confront the Patriots in the Super Bowl. His 66 percent catch rate is higher than the 60 percent rate we’d expect based on the length of his average target, and we calculate that this difference has amounted to 26 “extra” catches over the past three seasons.

Drop in called penalties between the NFL regular season and the playoffs this year. However, defensive holding — the kind of thing that can stop a stunning athlete like Julio Jones from completing catches if it goes uncalled — has remained constant, at about 1.2 per game. [ESPN]

Career passing yards for Atlanta’s Matt Ryan, who’s entering his first Super Bowl with the most yards for a first-time Super Bowl QB in the modern NFL era. [ESPN]

2 regulations
President Trump signed an executive order Monday that would require two federal regulations to be rescinded for every new federal regulation implemented.

Gregg Phillips — a self-proclaimed voter fraud authority who has said without any evidence that there was illegal voting this past election and who has enjoyed the ear of the president in such matters, namely a campaign against people registered to vote in more than one state — was found to be registered to vote in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi. That doesn’t mean he — or anyone, really — votes in more than one state. It just means that sometimes people decide to go to another state to live their lives. Shocking, I know.

And, look, I’m just aware enough of this science fictional canon to be pretty ticked off about Capaldi calling it quits after a mere three seasons. We’re talking about an entity that can regenerate just 13 times, and Capaldi is playing the penultimate one. (This is how they recast a character that has been around for actual generations.)

The order was met with chaos, and by Sunday the attorneys general from 15 states and Washington, D.C., had announced opposition to the ban. [Reuters]

We’ll want to wait and see if the numbers hold, but Trump’s approval rating, according to Gallup, has gone negative for the first time in his presidency, with 45 percent approving of the job he is doing as president and 48 percent disapproving. Incoming presidents typically have a grace period of a year or more before their numbers slip to majority disapproval. [Los Angeles Times]

10,000
The reaction to Friday’s executive order from some in the private sector was swift: Howard Schultz, the chairman and CEO of Starbucks, committed to hiring 10,000 refugees over the next five years, and Google set up a $2 million “crisis fund” with up to a $2 million employee match to benefit the American Civil Liberties Union, the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations’ refugee agency. [USA Today, Starbucks]

$24,164,691
While public officials were sorting out their reactions to the executive order, the ACLU sent attorneys to people who were being detained in U.S. airports as a result. The ACLU said it raised more than $24 million in online donations over the weekend, compared with its annual average of about $3 million to $4 million. [Dustin Volz, ACLU]

Other things also happened this weekend! Randy Orton won his second WWE Royal Rumble, defeating Roman Reigns to win the event. He then pointed at a big sign that said “Wrestlemania,” which leads me to believe that it’s coming up soon and that he intends to attend. (I am new to this. Sorry. A lot of things went down this weekend, and I couldn’t get around to most of them.) Denzel won at the Screen Actors Guild! So did the “Stranger Things” cast. There was also a Pro Bowl game, I think.

6 minutes 56 seconds
In the interest of diversifying the type of content you read in Significant Digits, here are some numbers about Sunday’s WWE Royal Rumble. Chris Jericho is a mere 110 seconds away from joining Triple H as the only other member of the four-hour club, hallowed ground for wrestlers who over the course of their career have spent more than four hours in Royal Rumble matches prior to elimination. Unless Triple H participates, Jericho must last only 6 minutes, 56 seconds — well under his historical average 26 minutes, 28 seconds active in his first nine Royal Rumbles — to obtain the first-place overall record. [The Wrestling Blog, via @StarOfSavage]

49 percent
Percentage of the U.S. public who believes there are no circumstances where the use of torture is acceptable. Donald Trump has recently said he thinks waterboarding works, but will defer to his Secretary of Defense about whether to use it. [Pew Research Center]

60 percent
Percentage of primate species that are threatened with extinction across the globe. Three quarters of the species have declining populations. We’re pretty much the exception here, folks. [EarthSky]

80 infections
There’s a mumps outbreak in Spokane, Washington that has led officials to tell 300 students without current vaccinations to stay home. Health officials said that the outbreak would be worse without the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination; the vaccine is about 88 percent effective overall. [ABC News]

$2 billion
Amount of money U.S. residents send to family in Mexico monthly, a figure that collectively accounts for some 3 percent of their economy. Regardless of the specifics, President Trump’s policies regarding our southern neighbor could cause substantial changes to their economy. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.7 trillion
Estimated total contribution to the U.S. economy from LGBT-owned businesses, according to a report from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. That’s based on an extrapolation from a group of more than 900 certified businesses contributing $1.15 billion as a whole. [Associations Now]

58 tournaments
Japan has had a drought of yokozuna, or sumo wrestling grand champions, in this century. For dozens of tournaments between 2006 and 2016, Japan didn’t have a tournament winner in part because of strong performances from Mongolian competitors. That ended this month when Kisenosato won a tournament and was promoted to the rank of yokozuna. [FiveThirtyEight]

93.5
Average Metacritic score of the ten highest-scoring films of 2016. Looking back at that top tier, last year was a very good year indeed — over the past 12 years, only 2013’s best movies were more highly rated. [The Black List]

216 percent of normal
Since October 1, downtown Los Angeles has recorded upwards of 13 inches of rain, a level that’s 216 percent what the city normally gets in that period and a respite from its searing drought. [The Los Angeles Times]

20,000
Yesterday a vestigial and arbitrary collection of stocks hit a number that American stock traders — mainly the kind made of flesh and not the kind made out of silicon and code — found to be aesthetically or psychologically pleasing. Congratulations to the Dow Jones Industrial Average for hitting 20,000. [The Wall Street Journal]

17.3 billion
Number of times Americans wrote out a check in 2015. Compare that number to the 69.5 billion debit card purchases in the same year. I’m pretty sure my checks still have my college living address on them, and every one of them has gone to a landlord. [The Wall Street Journal]

Today we’re taking a short break from your regularly scheduled roasting of the New England Patriots to talk about the Oscars nominations that were announced yesterday. I am the culture writer around these parts, and the Oscars are my jam, so today it’s an all-Oscars SigDig.

1
Amazon’s “Manchester by the Sea” became the first-ever film produced by a digital streaming service to be nominated for best picture. Netflix has had some success attracting awards attention, but primarily in the documentary category. [The Hollywood Reporter]

6 films
Yesterday a total of nine films were nominated for best picture: “La La Land,” “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Fences,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Arrival,” “Lion,” “Hell or High Water” and “Hidden Figures.” Director Martin Scorsese probably isn’t thrilled: bookmakers gave his film “Silence” better odds of winning best picture than the latter six of those nominated films. [FiveThirtyEight]

14 nominations
“La La Land” has tied the record for total Oscar nominations set by “All About Eve” and “Titanic,” hauling in a total of 14. When it comes to lifetime acting Oscar nominations, Meryl Streep extended her record with a 20th nomination, for “Florence Foster Jenkins.” [ABC News, The AV Club]

35 percent
Percentage of this year’s acting nominees who are people of color, a welcome departure from recent years that failed to recognize diverse talent. [Variety]

84 percent
That’s the percentage of time that the winner of the Directors Guild award for best feature film direction went on to win the Academy Award for best director over the past 25 years. We use stats like that — the historical accuracy of guild and critic awards — to build our annual Oscar tracking model, which we launched yesterday. Check it out. [FiveThirtyEight]

467 minutes
“O.J.: Made In America” is 7 hours 47 minutes long, and it is now the longest film ever nominated for an Oscar. (It’s nominated for best documentary.) Full disclosure, FiveThirtyEight is owned by ESPN, which made that movie. [Variety]

3:40 a.m.
A 25-year-old Patriots fan drunkenly pulled the fire alarm at the Logan Airport Hilton at 3:40 a.m. Sunday. The Pats’ opponents later that day — the Pittsburgh Steelers — were staying at the Hilton that evening. The fan, Dennis Harrison, has been charged with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. It should not be difficult to assemble a jury of his peers, in my estimation, because how hard can it be to find 12 drunk Patriots fans in the vicinity of Logan airport? [The Los Angles Times]

45 percent
President Trump currently has a 45 percent job approval rating after three days in the presidency according to the Gallup tracker. All presidents since the beginning of the Gallup tracker have had a net approval rating 32 points or higher, with the exception of President Trump, who has a net approval rating of 0. The same percentage of respondents approve of the job he is doing as the percentage who disapprove. [FiveThirtyEight]

Approximate number of geese killed by toxic waste emanating from a former copper mine in Montana this past weekend. Regardless of how you feel about geese, toxic waste or copper mines, this should prove an instructive moment for how the Trump Environmental Protection Agency will handle the Superfund site. [The Guardian]

37 million
A report from the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Rights found that should Roe v. Wade be overturned, more than 37 million women in 33 states could live in an area where abortion was illegal. [The Cut]

$250 million
Price of the home at 944 Bel Air Road, and reportedly the most expensive house in America. The 12-bedroom, 21-bathroom home boasts great views of Los Angeles so you can yearn Gatsby-like for that better Old Money lifestyle in the distance, and naturally has five bars inside to deal with all the problems that money causes. [The Guardian]

$37 billion
Aetna’s $37 billion bid to purchase rival insurer Humana was blocked by a judge because of antitrust concerns. If you’re one of the folks waiting for the $48 billion Anthem and Cigna merger to be approved, you’re probably sweating right about now. [Bloomberg]

4 justices
Back in September, eight of nine Texas Supreme Court justices voted to reject a case related to same-sex marriage rights in the Lone Star State. After a campaign led by the state’s top Republicans, at least four of those justices voted Friday to reinstate the case, with oral arguments set for March 1. Opponents of gay marriage in Texas see a chance to strip government employees of what attorney Jonathan Saenz called “illegal same-sex benefits.” Those against re-litigating same-sex marriage claimed the court may have been encouraged by the election of President Trump. [The Austin American-Statesman]

Fall in global production of farmed salmon in 2016 by volume, thanks to a monstrosity called the sea louse. It’s a miserable parasite that ravages farmed salmon populations, and now salmon prices are bound to rise. [Quartz]

25 percent
Awesome news! We’re running out of sports to create interactive models for now that we’ve launched FiveThirtyEight’s club soccer index. As it stands, Chelsea has a 68 percent chance of winning the Premier League, Barcelona has a 52 percent chance to win La Liga, Bayern Munich has a 90 percent shot of winning Bundesliga, Juventus has a 63 percent chance of winning Serie A, and Monaco has a 49 percent chance of winning Ligue 1. Barcelona has a 26 percent shot of winning the Champions League. [FiveThirtyEight]

61 percent
The Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl after each team won its conference championship game Sunday. FiveThirtyEight’s Elo analysis says the Patriots have a 61 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl, and according to my analysis there is a 39 percent chance of a positive end to the NFL season. [FiveThirtyEight]

A truck lost its trailer transporting some 38,000 pounds of marbles in Indianapolis Saturday morning, causing substantial traffic problems and low-hanging jokes. [Fox 40]

470,000 people
Crowd scientists estimate that at least 470,000 people attended the Women’s March in Washington. D.C. Metro ridership was measured at 1,001,613 entries, the second-biggest daily volume in the history of the D.C. Metro, after only President Obama’s 2009 inauguration day, which saw about 1.1 million entries. [The Washington Post, The New York Times]

Six of 58
According to Sen. Martin Heinrich, who has sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump pleading for continuity of leadership at the Pentagon and National Nuclear Security Administration, Trump has requested that just six of 58 appointed officials at the Pentagon stay in their positions until they can be replaced. The incoming administration has so far preferred to purge President Obama’s appointees as quickly as possible. [Gizmodo]

“an additional dozen or so”
Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page is attended to by a “handful” of company employees; a “dozen or so” others who are responsible for keeping spam, harassment and rude memes off of his page; and a fleet of professional photographers to snap the photos. The result is about as anodyne as you might expect from a few dozen Silicon Valley employees reverse-engineering authentic human interaction: This actually is my first rodeo, reads one post just above a set of photos of Zuckerberg looking a lot like a glad-handing gubernatorial candidate. But the real reason to swing by the Zuckerberg profile is to gape at the collection of comments and commenters that populate a tech CEO’s troll-proofed Facebook profile — it’s a perplexing species of celebrity social media account interaction. [Bloomberg]

48 percent
The prices commanded by marijuana on wholesale markets have fallen as legalization and decriminalization have spread. New investors are helping to cut production costs, leading to steep drops, such as a 48 percent drop in Colorado (now down to $1,300 per pound) since legal marijuana sales began in January 2014. [Bloomberg]

53.8 percent
Barry Bonds, the greatest baseball player of all time, received a vote on 238 Hall of Fame ballots this year, or 53.8 percent of all ballots submitted, leaving him short of the 75 percent share needed to be inducted. Roger Clemens received 239 votes. Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and Pudge Rodriguez each surpassed the 75 percent threshold. Vlad Guerrero, a cool superstar who drank from puddles as a child because he didn’t have access to running water, received 317 votes, good for 71.7 percent, and most baseball people seem to think he will get in next year. Can it, Trevor Hoffman. [ESPN]

266
Hickey went around and counted the “for your consideration” ads running in the major entertainment rags ahead of Oscars voting season and then converted the ad space into square inches for easy comparison. “Manchester by the Sea” was advertised in 5,155 square inches, second only to “Loving,” which was in 5,156. “Kubo and the Two Strings,” the most broadly advertised animated film of the season, appeared in 2,540 square inches. And a good deal further down the list were two films with 266 square inches apiece: “Moonlight,” which won the Golden Globe for best picture, drama, and “Kung Fu Panda 3,” which features voice acting from Jack Black.

3 years
It’s been almost three years since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, and after a laborious search of more than 46,000 square miles of sea, the search for the remains of the aircraft has been called off. [The New York Times]

7 years
President Obama on Tuesday commuted most of the 35-year prison sentence of former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who has been incarcerated for almost seven years. She will be released in four months. Manning — who has tried to take her own life twice in the past year — leaked documents from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and roughly 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. [The New York Times]

18 percent
Percentage of Philadelphia households that reported evidence of rodents, the largest percentage among the 25 U.S. cities broken out in data from the latest federal American Housing Survey. When it came to vermin of the cockroach variety, New Orleans, Houston and Miami topped the list of infested cities. [Bloomberg]

45 percent
Percentage of people who think the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is a good idea. As the GOP-controlled Congress plans its repeal, the legislation has never been more popular, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Among respondents, 45 percent said it’s a good idea, and 41 percent said it’s a bad idea. [Mark Murray, NBC News]

4 teams
The NFL’s divisional playoff games are in the books, including the Green Bay Packers defeating the Universally Reviled Dallas Cowboys in the best game of the playoffs so far, (Congrats, Blythe.) And we’ve got our conference championship week probabilities all figured out. The New England Patriots have a 70 percent chance of beating the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Atlanta Falcons are 61-percent favorites against the Packers. The favorites to win the Super Bowl, in order: Patriots (43 percent), Falcons (25 percent), Packers (16 percent) and Steelers (15 percent). [FiveThirtyEight]

6 percent
After several years of rising revenue, a launch accident in June 2015 helped push Elon Musk’s SpaceX into the red in the last fiscal year. The company is reportedly fine, and space is hard, but a 6 percent drop in revenue doesn’t feel good. [The Wall Street Journal]

45 minutes
The federal government and Amtrak could cut the travel time between New York and Boston by 45 minutes, down to two hours and 45 minutes. While high speed rail is common in many developed nations, the plan — which would add tracks and trains in some small towns in Rhode Island and Connecticut — isn’t sitting well with some residents living along the route. [The Wall Street Journal]

146 years
After 146 years of operation, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will hold its final circus later this year. It turns out that “check out these animals doing awesome tricks” was made a bit superfluous as a live roadshow once we had ubiquitous cameras, the means to spread video far and wide and a rudimentary understanding of the capacity of mammals to experience pain. [The Atlantic]

3,391 guns
You cannot bring guns onto an airplane in a carry-on bag. That line in the airborne social contract was apparently news to the flyers responsible for the 3,391 guns confiscated by the Transportation Security Administration in 2016. That’s a record and up 30 percent from 2015. Eighty-three percent of them were loaded. [USA Today]

$26 million
Oscar contender “Hidden Figures” won the holiday weekend box office. “Sing” and “La La Land” continued to roll on. But it’s the wide releases where the numbers are rough; three high-profile studio films tanked: Ben Affleck’s “Live By Night,” Martin Scorsese’s “Silence” and “Monster Trucks.” [The Hollywood Reporter]

Approximate number of web searches in Los Angeles for the Chargers (then of San Diego) for each search of the Rams (then of St. Louis) from 2011 through early 2016. The Rams moved to Los Angeles last year, and the Chargers this week announced they will do the same. [FiveThirtyEight]

This weekend’s closest game appears to be Green Bay at Dallas on Sunday afternoon, with the hometown and also evil Cowboys having a 57 percent chance to win the game. [FiveThirtyEight]

$125
Fee to apply to have a parade in Whitefish, Montana. This is germane to the national conversation because a bunch of literal Nazis wanted to have a march there, but their application was incomplete and the money order they sent was $60 short of the required fee. The white supremacists and neo-Nazis now hope hold their march sometime in February. [The Flathead Beacon]

Whenever President-elect Donald Trump tweets about Mexico, the peso jumps around on international currency markets. Mexico is spending considerable reserves to defend the currency, but peso traders have come up with a cheaper solution: Just buy Twitter for $12 billion and then shut it down. It’s the monetary policy version of catching the Snitch. [Bloomberg]

4.1 percent
Percentage of American adults who identify as LGBT, an estimated 10,052,000 people. That’s an increase from 2012, which, as a reminder, was also the year after the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the military was lifted, the year when being transgender was declassified as a mental illness, and three years before same-sex marriage was recognized nationwide. [Gallup]

51-48
In the early hours of Thursday morning, the Senate voted 51-48 on a budget measure that will make it easier to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don’t yet have a framework for what could replace Obamacare, but thanks to the passage of the measure it will take a simple majority to overturn the law. [The Associated Press]

55 years
The San Diego Chargers plan to announce they will move to Los Angeles, a city where NFL viewership literally dropped after the St. Louis Rams moved there last year. Listen, after watching “La La Land,” I totally get the urge to move to sunny Los Angeles and get away from this miserable city. But that happy disposition wears off in an hour, maybe two, and it’s no reason to move our football team after 55 years in San Diego. [ESPN]

$204,000
Municipal billing records indicate cities have invoiced the Trump campaign for at least $204,000 in unpaid bills for police protection provided over the course of the campaign. The Clinton campaign owes at least $25,000. [The Center for Public Integrity]

In a news conference Wednesday, Donald Trump said he would turn over control of his businesses to his sons but not sell them. He also said that just this past weekend, he had turned down a $2 billion development deal in Dubai. Trump said his company won’t make any new foreign deals while he is president but could still entertain domestic offers if they pass a vetting process. [Reuters]

103 miniature swarming drones
The U.S. military launched swarms of 103 miniature drones from several F/A-18s in an exercise. The likeliest use of the swarms — which can sneak through air defense systems like the noble warrior pigeon of old — will be surveillance. [BBC]

At least 800 of the 2,500 students at St. Charles East High School in Illinois did not show up Monday due to what is believed to be a norovirus outbreak. The school was closed on Tuesday for a deep bleach. [ABC News]

$20 million
Vegas was burned by the huge Clemson comeback in Monday’s college football championship game. Gamblers bet close to $20 million on the game in Nevada, and based on reports from several sports books, most of their money was on the underdog Clemson Tigers. It turns out people love betting against Alabama, and for once it actually worked. [CBS Sports]

521 million British pounds
The international soccer body FIFA announced it will expand the number of teams in the 2026 World Cup from 32 to 48. So, why not make the digit “48”? Well, this is significant digits, and the main thing you should take away from the expansion is that FIFA research found a 48-team tournament would increase revenue to 5.29 billion British pounds (about $6.5 billion). That would boost projected profits for the not-for-profit group by 521 million pounds. [BBC]

$1.5 billion
George Lucas will build the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles — not Chicago or San Francisco, which had previously been candidates to host to the Star Wars creator’s $1.5 billion eclectic collection of stuff. Thus comes to an end a long and dismal saga, at least until someone tries to reboot it over some perceived slight. [Bloomberg]

24.9 billion yen
Japan has a program where citizens can earmark a portion of their taxes to go to their hometowns. It’s a way for people who move to the big city to support the more rural areas whence they came. Technically, though, it’s a way for city dwellers to support a hometown, not necessarily theirs. Once the boonies picked up on this, they started offering booze or beef or other gifts and incentives to people who designate them as their “hometown.” This has been a boon for some areas — Hokkaido got 12.8 billion yen out of the program in 2015 — but it means that cities like Tokyo miss out on tax revenue, to the tune of a 24.9 billion yen loss for the metropolis in 2015.

Estimated increase in big-city murders in 2016, according to an analysis of preliminary data by FiveThirtyEight contributor and crime analyst Jeff Asher. The same cohort of cities saw a 14.8 percent rise in murders between 2014 and 2015. Still, murders are down compared to the 1980s and 1990s. [FiveThirtyEight]

In an upset, Clemson beat favorite Alabama to win the College Football Championship game last night. Alabama led for most of the game, but after a ridiculous series of events, Clemson won with a literal last-second touchdown. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

$100,000
The E-Sports Entertainment Association, which organizes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive matches and tournaments, said hackers released the personal details of many of its users after the company refused to pay a $100,000 ransom. The hack appears to have included names, email addresses, birth dates and other information for some 1,503,707 user accounts. [ESPN]

-$1.9 million
A new study from the Vera Institute of Justice found that in 2015, New Orleans spent $6.4 million jailing people because they could not pay bills imposed by the city’s criminal justice system. Meanwhile, New Orleans collected $4.5 million from criminal defendants in the form of bail, fines and fees. In other words, the city managed to find a way to lose money collecting bail. [FiveThirtyEight]

$53.2 million
Between 2003 and 2005, the oil and gas company Infineum reported $53.2 million in sales to Iran. During that time, Exxon Mobil had a 50 percent stake in Infineum. Also during that time, the U.S. had sanctions on Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. Rex Tillerson, a top Exxon executive at the time of the deal and later its CEO, is now President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the State Department. [USA Today]

Share of homes in the Los Angeles television market that watched Fox’s NFL telecasts this year, down from 8.3 percent in 2015. Generally speaking, when you strip another city of its long-held franchise and send it off to sunny California at considerable expense to the franchise and stakeholders, you want to see that particular number go up. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

8 percent
The NFL Wildcard weekend is over with New York, Oakland, Miami and Detroit losing to Green Bay, Houston, Pittsburgh and Seattle, respectively. The winners go on to face organizations coming off of a first-round bye, with Seattle and Green Bay having the best shots of the group of winning the Super Bowl, an 8 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

41 percent
Theranos Inc. plans to fire about 41 percent of its workforce. The move comes after the blood-testing startup has been sued by business partners, targeted by regulators and forced to pull its original product line from the market. [Bloomberg]

26,171 bombs
Estimated number of bombs the United States dropped in seven countries during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, according to analysis of military data by researchers at the Council on Foreign Relations. They say the true number is almost certainly higher. [Council on Foreign Relations]

$2.1 billion
McDonald’s will sell an 80 percent stake in its Chinese business to a state-owned investment group and a U.S. private equity firm for $2.1 billion. The burger chain now owns and operates about 65 percent of its Chinese locations, but it has been trying to franchise more of its international restaurants. [BBC]

23 percent
The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, crashed as much as 23 percent Thursday, from about $1,153 per bitcoin to $887 per bitcoin, just as it was within spitting distance of its all-time high, $1,165.89 per bitcoin. [CNBC]

2,361 books
Chuck Finley, a fake person made up by several librarians, checked out 2,361 books at East Lake County Library in Florida over nine months of 2016. It’s crazy — Finley seemed to take an interest in books just as their time-on-shelf-without-being-checked-out expiration date was about to arrive. [The Orlando Sentinel]

92 million
Number of subscriptions to music streaming services across the industry, a jump of about 50 percent in 2016. [Bloomberg]

$900 million
In an attempt to stay afloat, Sears is selling its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $900 million. Sears bought the brand in 1927 for $500. [The Wall Street Journal]

$2,237,633,000
A woman is suing Chipotle for more than $2 billion, saying the company used her photo in promotional materials without permission, because presumably her attorney couldn’t stomach pursuing a dime more than eleventy bazillion dollarinos. [Grub Street]

$8 billion
Charles F. Feeney, who made a fortune from duty-free stores and prudent investments in technology companies, last year successfully completed his goal of giving away $8 billion. Over years of giving, he aggressively avoided the spotlight and asked recipients not to publicize the donations. Feeney has kept about $2 million — with an “m,” not a “b” — to continue his modest retirement. What a nice dude. [The New York Times]

-0.6 wins
Two excellent analyses of the year-after effect of sacking an NFL head coach dropped Wednesday, one from FiveThirtyEight contributor Michael Lopez and the other from ESPN’s Brian Burke. As one hopes when looking at independent analyses tackling a similar problem, their findings were consistent. Each found that teams that sacked their coach tended to do worse the next season than similar teams that did not fire their coach; Lopez estimated that teams that fired their coach saw their wins drop by about 0.6 the next season, and Burke found that the effect seemed to last, with teams that held on to their coach performing about 6 percent better two years on than those that fired them. Anyway, moral of the story is: best of luck, Rams and Bills. [ESPN, StatsByLopez]

22 percent
A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Harvard School of Public Health interviewed 1,613 adult gun owners in 2015 and found that 22 percent of owners who had gotten their newest firearm within the previous two years obtained it without a background check. [Annals of Internal Medicine]

36 percent
Quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns made 567 passing attempts this season and suffered 66 sacks and 138 hits for their troubles. This means that on 36 percent of all passing plays, the QB ended up on the ground, the highest “QB abuse rate” in the NFL. [Unconventional Stats]

79 organs
Irish researchers are arguing that a continuous fold of tissue that supports the intestines should be classified as an organ: the mesentery. That would crank up the total number of organs in the body to 79 — by many counts. [Ars Technica]

10,100 workers
Macy’s will cut 10,100 jobs after a dismal holiday sales period; it had already announced plans to close 100 of its 730 stores. [The New York Times]

$175 billion
Total losses resulting from natural disasters in 2016, according to a German insurance company, with insurance companies on the hook for about $50 billion of that. [The Guardian]

2 members
After the death of Sister Frances Carr on Monday, there are only two members of the religious society known as the Shakers. The group — officially the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearance — preaches celibacy and stopped adopting orphans some time ago, hence its membership drought. [The Guardian]

-4 percent
College football game attendance is down 4 percent on average since 2009 at the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision schools. That’s eating into the lucrative business of college football. [Bloomberg]

19 states
It is now 2017, which means a bunch of people got government-mandated raises as 19 states and 21 local jurisdictions increased their minimum wage. Lots of people have all sorts of economics-informed ideas about what will happen now — as is their wont, economists disagree on the specifics — so it’s a great real-life experiment for that crowd. [FiveThirtyEight]

4,200 “gifts”
I have no idea if it’s a protest, or a celebration, or just a cannabis-induced moment of inspiration, but the DC Cannabis Coalition is giving out 4,200 free joints at Dupont Circle in Washington on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. It’s legal to give away but not to sell marijuana in Washington, hence the great price. Then 4 minutes and 20 seconds into the incoming president’s speech — you know, the weed number — the 4,200 recipients are encouraged to spark up. Things are changing in America, so it provides a brief moment of consistency when potheads pull weird attention-seeking stunts regardless of who’s in office, you know? [WUSA 9]

554 million tacos
Jack in the Box, a fast-food chain, sells a ridiculous number of tacos that — based on the testimonials of people interviewed by The Wall Street Journal — are somewhere between gross and immensely addictive. That’s about as many Big Macs as McDonalds says it moved in the U.S. in 2007. [The Wall Street Journal]

Welcome to 2017.

13 percent
Percentage of American private-sector workers who have a traditional pension, down from 38 percent in 1979. Now 401(k) plans are the common retirement strategy for Americans, and some of their early supporters regret it. [The Wall Street Journal]

35 percent
Probability that the New England Patriots will win the Super Bowl, the highest of any team in the playoffs. They’re followed by Kansas City (16 percent); Atlanta and Dallas (14 percent); and Pittsburgh, Seattle and Green Bay (5 percent). [FiveThirtyEight]

240 green traffic lights
Heaven is a place on earth: An Uber driver says he made it through 240 consecutive green lights in 27 minutes while driving from Harlem to the Lower East Side in New York City. [The Associated Press]

189,100
Number of multifamily rental units completed between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016 across 54 U.S. metropolitan areas. Of those units, 84 percent were luxury, which seems pretty ridiculous. If everything is luxury, is anything luxury? [The Wall Street Journal]

91,404,322 miles
Earth will be at its perihelion on Wednesday, the point in our orbit where we’re closest to the sun. We’ll be a mere 91,404,322 miles away from that cascading nuclear torrent that feeds Earth energy, roughly 3 million miles closer than we are at our farthest point in July. [EarthSky]

$400 million
HGTV — the channel that made the “buy a home, fix it up and then either resell it or live in it and make babies” hero’s journey a viable business model — is killing it, now the third-most-watched cable channel. One potential reason for this is the sheer volume of programming the network puts out. HGTV makes 900 hours of television for $400 million annually, which is a great deal; Netflix spent $500 million on 600 hours in 2016. [Bloomberg]

16 cars
Uber, which decided to experiment with a faulty batch of 16 driverless cars on California roads where real-life people are, has moved the cars’ trial to Phoenix, Arizona. [The Guardian]

39.5 percent
Percentage of Americans aged 18 to 34 who live with their parents or another family member. The figure has been steadily rising since the fifties. [The Wall Street Journal]

41 cents
A Chicago man is suing several McDonald’s restaurants because the “Extra Value Meal” is 41 cents more expensive than if each item was separately purchased. The man says the lawsuit is “about principle.” Listen, everyone has to pick a hill to die on eventually. James Gertie has found his, and there’s nobility to that. [USA Today]

2,350 acres
Number of acres of farmland Kentucky devoted in 2016 to the cultivation of hemp, Marijuana’s close relative that has a myriad of industrial uses. That number is up from 922 in 2015. That’s almost a quarter of national production. [Bloomberg]

$1.5 million
A Canadian businessman saved more than 50 Syrian refugee families — more than 200 people — by putting up $1.5 million in funds and offering jobs to refugees who come to Canada. [Toronto Life]

€20 billion
The world’s oldest bank is the Italian Monte dei Paschi di Siena, but age does not breed stability: The Italian government has agreed to a €20 billion bailout of the bank, considered one of the weakest in Western Europe. [The Independent]

About 10
Number of times somebody tried to camp out and have a slumber party in an IKEA somewhere in the world this year, including two 14-year-olds in Sweden recently. The company is now on record asking teens and others to stop doing it, having never heard of the Streisand Effect evidently. Hear that kids? IKEA slumber parties are the new recreational drug use. [BBC]

22 percent
Percentage of Americans who have given to an online fundraising project. For some context: that’s higher than the number who have used a ride hailing app (15 percent) but lower than the number who have bought tickets from an online reseller (28 percent). [Pew Research Center]

455
Number of scripted television series that aired this year according to the research team at FX, up from 421 last year. If your pilot isn’t already in development, that’s on you. [TV By The Numbers]

2,606
Number of census tracts, plus a further 278 zip codes, where lead poisoning is at least twice as prevalent as it was in Flint, Michigan at the height of Flint’s lead crisis. There are likely more areas, but Reuters was only able to analyze records in 21 states. [Reuters]

$105,803
Cindy Stowell, a 41-year old from Texas, just finished a seven-episode win streak on “Jeopardy!” that aired through Wednesday. Over the course of the run — which was pre-taped in August — Stowell won $105,803 and had a good rapport with Trebek. Now we know that as she taped, Stowell had Stage IV colon cancer with a six-month prognosis, competed despite a blood infection to fulfill a life-long dream, kicked serious tail as far as Jeopardy win streaks go, was raising the money to donate to cancer-related groups and passed away on December 5. I’ll take “Reasons to cry on the subway” for $400, Alex. [SB Nation]

1.3 billion
Tesla has 1.3 billion miles of car-driving data thanks to its Autopilot-equipped vehicles that are already on the road before competitors in Detroit and Silicon Valley can roll self-driving cars off the lot. It’s a massive competitive advantage. [Bloomberg]

0.9 percent
A poll that checked in on the same group of voters throughout the election found that between October and Election Day 0.0 percent of respondents moved from Trump to Clinton, while 0.9 percent switched from Clinton to Trump. If there was indeed a comparable swing on a national level, that’s 1.2 million votes. [FiveThirtyEight]

17.9 points
Average points allowed from the New York Giants defense, a squad that has managed to stop their opponents’ short passes, which are the main way modern NFL offenses advance the ball. It’s why the team is a 97 percent chance to make the playoffs. Also, the Giants have given the Dallas Cowboys their only two losses of the season. The Giants have a precedent of denying the league’s top team an undefeated season, of course. [FiveThirtyEight]

$20
A bill filed by South Carolina state Rep. Bill Chumley would require all sellers of computers to install online pornography blocking technology or face a fine of $20 per computer sold, and South Carolinians would have to pay $20 to remove the blocker. This is gonna go over great with the constituents, I just know it. [The Charlotte Observer]

11 days
Saudi Arabia is adopting the Gregorian calendar. The state previously used the Islamic calendar, where it is 1438, not 2016. The shift from a lunar calendar to one based on the rotation of the earth means people have to work an “extra” 11 days per year. [The Economist]

728 clues
The New York Times’s iconic crossword puzzle tried something new this past weekend, with a 728-clue crossword puzzle in a special print section. [The Verge]

$5 million
A sham botnet operated by Russian criminals is skimming up to $5 million a day from a counterfeit advertising ring, where bots visit fake web pages with real advertisements to juice fake video hits that generate real money. [CNN]

3 electoral votes
Several members of Washington State’s presidential electors defected from Hillary Clinton during the Electoral College vote and instead supported for candidates who didn’t win the state. Three people voted for Gen. Colin Powell and one voted for Yankton Sioux elder Faith Spotted Eagle. The faithless electors may each owe a $1,000 fine. [Los Angeles Times]

78 pardons
President Obama pardoned 78 people, the largest single-day pardon of any president. He also commuted the sentences of 153 other inmates. [The Star]

81 percent
Percentage of non-Christians who celebrate the holiday of Christmas in the United States. About a third of Americans in total celebrate it more as a cultural holiday. [The Pew Research Center]

962 cases
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported 99 “complicated” black lung cases in the past five years, but that’s only the number that the government thought had occurred. The reality is much worse: NPR contacted 11 black lung clinics across coal country and found a total 962 cases since 2010. [NPR]

17,000 points
Harry Dent, who less than two weeks ago said the Dow could fall 17,000 points as a result of Donald Trump’s election win, is suddenly bullish on the market. A stunning reversal! [Business Insider]

13 billion euros
Both Ireland and Apple are now challenging a European Union decision forcing Ireland to recover 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from the company. The EU is arguing that there was a sweetheart deal between Ireland and Apple that allowed the company to significantly minimize its tax burden, while Apple is arguing the EU changed its policy retroactively.

41 percent
The number of Wells Fargo consumer checking accounts that were opened in November was down 41 percent compared to a year earlier. [Reuters]

Daily fantasy sites like DraftKings are heavily stratified, with power users reaping huge chunks of the financial gains. [Extreme Bernie Sanders voice:] The top 1 percent of users accounted for 47 percent of winnings in the past six months. [The Wall Street Journal]

196,000 units
The NES Classic — a retro gaming system that lets players revisit classic Nintendo games — has sold well, moving 196,000 units from November 11 through the end of that month, according to a market research firm. It’s a bright spot for the industry even though spending on video game hardware is down. [TechCrunch]

555,808,292
A truly ridiculous amount of prescription opiates have been sent to West Virginia from 2007 to 2012: 555,808,292 doses of hydrocodone and 224,260,980 doses of oxycodone. That’s 433 pills for every person in the state over that time span. [Charleston Gazette-Mail]

The attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing six drug companies — Teva, Mylan, Aurobindo Pharma, Citron Pharma, Heritage Pharmaceuticals and Mayne Pharma — of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. [The New York Times]

21 percent
Percentage of working members of the Animation Guild who are women. That’s not good, but it’s better than the Hollywood Reporter’s recent roundtable on gender and racial issues in animation — the seven-person roundtable was 100 percent male and 100 percent white. [Fusion]

33 counts
Dylann Roof was found guilty on Thursday on all 33 counts related to the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Roof was accused of killing nine black parishioners during a church bible study. [ABC News]

114,700 words
Length of the Wookieepedia entry on Anakin Skywalker — a.k.a. Darth Vader — before the Extended Universe was culled. That’s longer than the Wikipedia articles about Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt combined. Essentially, a decision was made in 2014 to designate a bunch of the Star Wars universe — the stuff that isn’t in the movies and some recent products — “Legends” rather than “canon.” This meant cutting that Vader encyclopedia article down to a mere 48,200 words, and it also made around 95 percent of the roughly 100,000 Wookieepedia articles canonically irrelevant.

10 percentage points
Only 41 percent of LGBT Americans rated their lives positively enough to fall into Gallup’s “thriving” category, according to a survey conducted Nov. 9 through Dec. 6. That’s down 10 percentage points compared to a Gallup survey conducted from Oct. 1 to Nov. 8 — you know, the period right before Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Pence won the White House. [Gallup]

30 percent
Share of Americans who rate Russia favorably, as of earlier this year. But public opinion about Russia tends to be way swingier than for other nations, so if the Trump administration takes a friendlier stance towards Russia, many Americans — particularly Republicans — might follow. [FiveThirtyEight]

61 years
Kokomo, Indiana, has overturned a 61-year-old law banning pinball in the town. I presume it’s been 61 years since that smooth-talkin’ out of town jasper tried to come ’round with a mighty fine smile and a tap in his step to remind the good parents of Kokomo that they’ve got trouble you see, trouble right here in Kokomo, trouble with a capital “t” and that rhymes with “p” and that stands for “pinball”! [The Kokomo Tribune]

93 percent
If the New York Giants beat the Detroit Lions this weekend, the Giants will have a 93 percent chance of making the playoffs, up from 75 percent right now, according to our Elo-based NFL predictions. If Detroit wins, their chances of making the playoffs jump from 84 percent to 98 percent. It’s the most important game of the weekend. [FiveThirtyEight]

Conair, the parent company of Cuisinart, is recalling eight million food processors after 69 consumer reports of broken blade shards appearing in food. [USA Today]

1 billion hacked accounts
In addition to a 2014 hack that affected 500 million user accounts it kept under wraps, Yahoo revealed on Wednesday that a separate attack in 2013 involved more than 1 billion accounts. This somehow puts a good spin on the calamitous end to my Yahoo Fantasy Football season, as now I can blame some botnet in a former Soviet republic for playing Allen Robinson last week over Kyle Rudolph, leading to my 1-point loss.

About 60 percent
Percentage of the Department of Energy’s budget that goes to the National Nuclear Security Administration. Which makes Donald Trump’s decision to nominate former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to run Energy a bit weird. Texas is an energy-rich state, so Perry has a lot of experience with those industries. But, despite its name, the Department of Energy spends much of its time focused on designing, securing and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. [The New York Times]

More than 70 percent
Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson is Trump’s pick to run the State Department. He’s got an interesting resume: More than 70 percent of Exxon’s untapped oil reserves are outside of the United States, in other countries, and the diplomacy required to obtain and maintain those reserves isn’t too dissimilar from the type required at Foggy Bottom. [FiveThirtyEight]

176,000 gallons
A North Dakota oil pipeline ruptured and dumped more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil into Ash Coulee creek, which then spread the spill onto an unknown amount of U.S. Forest Service and private land. This incident happened just 150 miles away from the Standing Rock protests, which are trying to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline being built on tribal lands for fear a pipe rupture could contaminate their water supply. [The Guardian]

4.18 million books
Sales of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” so far this year. Some people in the publishing community consider the book — it’s really a script for a play by the same name — a continuation of the Harry Potter series. Some people in the newsletter-writing community consider it a cash-grab that made the main characters “platonic” in the pursuit of mass-market appeal. Still, those 4.18 million copies are nearly four times as many sales as the runner-up, Paula Hawkins’s “The Girl on the Train,” so I guess that’s that. [Quartz]

19.4 million deaths
Of the 80.4 million deaths that occurred in the U.S. from 1980 through 2014, 19.4 million were listed with “garbage code” causes, according to a new study. These codes are extremely generic and nondescript, like “unspecified stroke” or “unspecified heart disease,” which don’t add much clarity to what caused the stroke or cardiac arrest. [FiveThirtyEight]

$200 million
The Oakland City Council and Alameda County Board of Supervisors approved a term sheet that would have the City pay $200 million to help build the Oakland Raiders a new stadium. The plan also gives the Raiders a plot of land worth $150 million. This is all part of an effort to convince the Raiders not to pack up and head to Las Vegas. Let’s see what Vegas’s counteroffer looks like. [Deadspin]

Nike has launched a new project, “Breaking2,” and assembled a team of “designers, scientists, coaches, and statisticians” with one goal: get someone to run a marathon’s 26.2 miles in less than two hours. The current record is 2:02:57. The company’s recruited a number of distance runners and plans to hold the record-breaking marathon in the Spring of 2017. [Wired]

16 Republican senators
Have expressed support for investigating alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.

And 30 percent of people who have heard “a lot” or “a little” about it aren’t sure what it stands for. [The Pew Research Center]

1.25 million
The hottest selling CD of the year is from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who sold 1.25 million CDs in five weeks according to Billboard, blowing away all his younger (and alive) competition. There’s a catch, though: Universal Music Group dropped a box set of Mozart’s complete discography to mark the 225th anniversary of his death, and each of the 200 discs in the set counts as a sale. So only about 6,000 buyers are responsible for Mozart topping the pops. [Quartz]

$1 billion
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected challenges to an NFL plan to pay $1 billion to settle lawsuits related to concussions filed by former players. The plan covers an estimated 20,000 NFL retirees for the next 65 years. [PBS]

U.S. deaths from drug overdoses were up 11 percent in 2015, claiming 52,404 lives, according to annual statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increase was driven by overdoses on heroin and prescription painkillers. Drug overdoses are involved in more deaths than car crashes and guns. [CBS News]

Amazon recently launched “The Grand Tour,” a car show featuring former talent from “Top Gear.” And apparently a lot of people want to watch the show but aren’t willing to subscribe to Amazon Prime to do it.

Casino stocks were sent tumbling after China capped the amount of money UnionPay customers can withdraw from a Macau ATM to 5,000 patacas, or around $626. Macau is an immensely important gambling site that has seen worldwide investment. [Bloomberg]

It’s not just bees: Giraffes are dying at an alarming rate. The giraffe population is down to 97,000 in 2015, down from 155,000 in 1985. [BBC]

Google’s search, Android, Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Cloud, and Pixel made $26.8 billion in operating income last fiscal year. They’re paying for a number of “moonshot” programs: Nest, Verily, Access, X, Sidewalk Labs, Jigsaw, DeepMind, and Calico cumulatively lost $3.8 billion. [Bloomberg]

Cost to take the Paris Metro right now. Due to smog conditions, the city has made public transportation free and has banned half the vehicles from the road at a given day. Related: I’m asking for a friend who is sick and tired of the MTA and could use some extra cash around the holidays, but does anyone know how to generate a substantial amount of smog? [The Independent]

So far five babies have been born with “Zika-related brain developmental symptoms” in New York City. [The New York Times]

11 times
People who groomed their pubic hair were found to be more likely to have an STD, with those who remove all of it more than 11 times per year more than four times as likely to have an STD. This was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, which as far as branding goes is up there with the “Great Dismal Swamp” when it comes to bad names for things you want people to enjoy. [NPR]

28 percent
For a typical family, that’s the percentage of income that goes towards rent as of 2014. In 1980, that figure was 25 percent. [Gallup]

59 percent
Percentage of Americans who want abortion to be all or mostly legal, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center poll, largely unchanged since a 1995 ABC News/Washington Post poll that found the same number in favor. Ohio is considering a bill that would make abortion illegal around only six weeks after conception. [FiveThirtyEight]

9,684
Number of consecutive snaps played by Joe Thomas, a left tackle — among the best in the NFL — has played for the Cleveland Browns. He has outlived 6 head coaches and 18 starting QBs. He may be on an organization that goes 0-16 this year. He still shows up. As far as I am concerned Joe Thomas is an inspiration to us all. [ESPN]

Jeff Fisher coaches the Los Angeles Rams, a team that has uniformly failed on offense with little sign of improvement. If the Rams lose one more game this season, Fisher will become the fifth-ever coach in the NFL to achieve five consecutive losing seasons with the same team. Three of his potential predecessors were sacked; the last was Tom Landry. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 seconds
Donald Trump tweeted about wanting to cancel a Boeing government contract 35 seconds after 8:52 a.m. yesterday. It took a full 10 seconds before the market reacted, sending the price of Boeing stock down. That chunk of time — ten seconds seems like a few heartbeats but in algorithmic computerized trading it’s a freaking lifetime — shows that the Street potentially hasn’t fully figured out how to trade on Trump’s tweets. [CNBC]

+18.8 points
The final contest of the 2016 election cycle — the Louisiana Senate runoff election this Saturday — is polling like it’s going to be a shellacking, with Republican John Neely Kennedy polling 18.8 points above Democrat Foster Campbell in the four polls taken since election day. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 percent
That’s the percentage of film reviews that come out two days or earlier before a movie release. The crux here is that you probably should take early scores from review aggregators with a grain of salt, as loads of movies see a big slip in the ratings right before hitting theaters. [FiveThirtyEight]

Google expects that 100 percent of its data centers and offices’ power will come from renewable energy sources by 2017. [Google Blog]

$60,000
Iowa will pay two Californians $60,000 after their bankroll was seized by Iowa State Patrol troopers in a warrantless search as part of an asset forfeiture. The Californians sued, and the state of Iowa not only will return the inappropriately ripped off cash but will also disband its state forfeiture team. [Iowa City Press Citizen]

Remember Pokemon Go? Well Sony’s got a game in Japan called “Fate/Grand Order” that’s giving it a run for its money, to the point that it’s single-handedly responsible for a 23 percent increase in operating profit for Sony Music in the latest quarter. [Bloomberg]

664 retractions
Number of retractions of scientific papers on MEDLINE, a database of scientific abstracts, in 2016. That’s in line with 2015’s figure of 684 retractions. [Retraction Watch]

10,000+ votes
Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina has finally conceded his re-election race to Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has a lead of more than 10,000 votes in the state. McCrory vastly underperformed the other statewide races — Donald Trump won the state by about 100,000 votes, and Sen. Richard Burr won by about 200,000 — and the controversial HB2 law signed by McCrory regarding public bathroom usage that opponents considered anti-LGBT is a potential culprit. [New York Magazine]

A one-of-a-kind Ferrari LaFerrari was auctioned off for $7 million, making it the priciest car sold that was made this century. The proceeds benefit the National Italian American Foundation’s Earthquake Relief Fund, which directs funds to earthquake relief. [The Verge]

$35 million
President-elect Donald Trump resides in New York City, in case you had not yet heard. Regrettably, so do like 8.4 million other people. As a result, New York City is spending a crapload of money putting police officers between those nine million people and Trump Tower. Mayor Bill de Blasio is asking the Obama administration for $35 million to pay for all those cops between election day and January 20. [New York Daily News]

$125 billion
A report that indicated the Pentagon could save $125 billion over five years by cutting bureaucratic waste among the 1,014,000 back office personnel — 268,000 of whom are outside contractors — was suppressed by leaders after the potential waste far exceeded expectations. [The Washington Post]

19 percent less bandwidth
Netflix has started letting users download shows and movies to view offline — which somehow uses less bandwidth than regular streaming. Part of this is how Netflix moves files around; the H.264/AVC High video encoding used for iPhone video downloading uses 19 percent less bandwidth on average compared to streaming. [Variety]

The Florida orange crop is less than a third of what is was 20 years ago, but appears poised for a comeback with agricultural innovations helping farmers beat a blight on their trees. [NPR]

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his intention to resign after the failure of a referendum he proposed that would mitigate the power of the senate. He lost the vote 60 to 40. [Bloomberg]

An annual U.K. survey asking people whom they trusted most found nurses absurdly credible, with 93 percent of people trusting them. [The Guardian]

Von Miller, a linebacker for the Denver Broncos, has sent every player in the AFC West — starters and practice squads alike — a bottle of custom Cabernet Sauvignon and a thank you note. That’s well over 200 people. [The Denver Post]

517 companies
Number out of 887 companies that obtained a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, which evaluates LGBT policies. That figure is up from 407 companies last year, with groups like Wal-Mart — which recently added insurance coverage for transgender employees — updating workplace policies since. Still, 8 percent of companies don’t have hiring and firing protections. [Bloomberg]

Nestle will cut sugar in its chocolate by 40 percent thanks to a breakthrough that the company says makes it possible to use less sugar without affecting taste. [BBC]

100 petabytes
Techies used to talk about the “sneakernet“: In an earlier era, it was sometimes faster to transfer large amounts of data by physically walking the drive to its destination, rather than sending it over the internet. Later, it sometimes made sense to put a computer server in your carry-on luggage rather than sending a terabyte of data across the country. Now, sneakernet has achieved its final form: Amazon Web Services has introduced Snowmobile, which is a tractor trailer that can hold up to 100 petabytes of data. Amazon will literally drive a tractor trailer to your data center, upload 100 petabytes over the course of like a week, and haul it away for backup elsewhere. [Motherboard]

Increase in Starbucks share price since January 2008, when Howard Schultz became the CEO of the company again.

Basically, they need a way to keep urine and feces away from astronauts for at least 144 hours in microgravity. The current solution is diapers. The winners can get up to $30,000 and presumably the eternal gratitude of future spacefarers able to maintain their first dignity while in orbit. [SF Gate]

12 to 15 years
Anita Thompson, the widow of writer Hunter S. Thompson, will clone and sell the late journalist’s marijuana stash. Essentially, the acclaimed and too often poorly imitated author of “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72” left a weed stash after his suicide in 2005, and the remains of that stash — which is 12 to 15 years old — will be cloned and available on the free market. At least when people try to imitate his lifestyle in the future, they will be smoking weak-as-hell ganja. [CNBC]

134 to 63
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi beat a challenge from Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan to remain as the House minority leader. She’s held the top job among House Democrats since 2003, but Ryan’s 63 votes far exceeds an earlier contender for the gig, Heath Shuler’s 43 votes in 2010, a potential sign of cracks in the coalition. [NPR]

1.5 million British pounds
The British pound contains meat. I mean, kind of: Animal fat is used in the production of the new five-pound note, and vegans aren’t thrilled. This was a fantastic opportunity for Bloomberg to interrogate exactly how much money was damaged by being eaten or chewed up, and apparently in the United Kingdom, money is a delicacy: Since 2003, nearly 1.5 million pounds have been destroyed by mastication. Using gold leaf in cuisine was a dangerous slippery slope, is what I’m saying. [Bloomberg]

$108 billion
How much money in student debt — through the current school year — that the U.S. government will forgive in coming years. [The Wall Street Journal]

$118 billion
In 2014, an estimated $118 billion in sales were lost domestically by cards being declined when they should not have been. This hits very close to home; the hallmark of a good weekend out of town for me is a call from Wells Fargo asking if some madman has stolen my card and spent hundreds of dollars in liquor stores, bars, casinos and restaurants. When my debit card gets declined due to suspicions of fraud in some Delaware gas station on the ride back to New York, it means I did the weekend right. [The Wall Street Journal]

870 billion
Number of cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris annually. The company has invested $3 billion into tobacco vaporizers, already available in some overseas markets, and plans to have the product in 20 markets this year. [Reuters]

1 point
Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh and ace kicker Justin Tucker have endorsed a senseless, ridiculous and honestly pretty awesome NFL rule that would give a team one point if they boot a kickoff between the uprights. In a tough year for kickers overall, Tucker is the only kicker to make every kick — 15 extra points and 27 field goals — and just this past Sunday got the ball between the uprights on a kickoff. [Fox Sports]

410 euros
The Dutch parliament has approved a ban on face coverings in public; the rule covers ski masks as well as burkas and niqab face veils. The fine is up to 410 euros, which is about $435. The Dutch Senate needs to approve the bill for it to become law in the Netherlands. [BBC]

506
A study suggests that about a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in outpatient settings in the U.S. were not appropriate. In 2010 and 2011, U.S. doctors wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 population, but only 353 were medically necessary. [JAMA, National Geographic]

$1,000
New York has made automated ticket bots super illegal, compared to the somewhat illegal they used to be. The previous fines were bearable by ticket scalpers, but the new ones are devastating: up to $1,000 or twice the gain from the crime, plus potential jail time. [The Verge]

1.3 million
Number of British citizens who live abroad in the European Union. In a parliamentary committee about health care for these folks, an interesting disparity came to light: There are about 70,000 British retirees living in Spain, but only 62 recorded Spaniards who thought to spend their golden years in the U.K. [Quartz]

4.8 million
Number of people aged 75 or older in Japan who have a drivers license, up from 2.4 million in 2005. Traffic accidents involving a driver aged 75 and up comprise 12.8 percent of incidents now, up from 7.4 percent a decade ago, and authorities are trying to get more 75-year-olds off the road by — no joke — offering discounts on ramen.

35 acres
Belgium will trade 35 acres of land to the Netherlands for seven acres of their land in a new agreement. Essentially, when you make a river a border for your nation in 1843, and then reconfigure the path of that river in 1961, you’re going to swap stretches of territory. It took the discovery of a headless corpse some time back and a subsequent jurisdictional kerfuffle to remind the nations they needed to deal with the land along the Meuse River at some point. [The New York Times]

552
Number of times Warren Dew commented on a FiveThirtyEight article from March 2014 through late November 2016. My colleague Christie Aschwanden wanted to find out what, precisely, motivates people like Dew to comment on articles on the internet, so she asked more than 8,500 people what their deal is. I will never forget being castigated in the comments for not properly identifying several background characters in the investigative journalism piece, “The ‘Charlie Brown Christmas Special’ Dancers You Most Want To Party With” last year. [FiveThirtyEight]

541,000
Japan is trying to deal with an estimated 541,000 “hikikomori,” young people who avoid school, work and interactions with people outside their families. It’s a pretty large problem — 1.6 percent of 15 to 39 year-olds in Japan are hikikomori. The Japanese government is working on bringing them back out into society. [Bloomberg]

$7 million
Zenefits agreed to pay $7 million as part of a settlement with California regulators over a scandal in which the company helped employees cheat on state insurance broker licensing requirements. The human resources startup owes half now and California will waive the other half if the company passes an examination in 2018. [Buzzfeed]

$9 million
New York City’s MTA wants to spend $9 million over the next four years on “24/7 social media.” That’s $2.25 million a year, around six grand a day. That’s enough to pay individual people hush money so they don’t tweet about the transportation agency’s complete inability run trains after midnight in most of the city. [Jalopnik]

2 percent
In what may be the biggest college football rivalry game of the year, No. 2 Ohio State beat No. 3 Michigan in double overtime, 30 to 27. Last week, Ohio State had a 61 percent chance of making the College Football Playoff and Michigan had a 37 percent shot, according to FiveThirtyEight’s college football predictions. Ohio is now a 90 percent chance of making the playoff, and Michigan’s chances are down to 2 percent. I went to William & Mary, not exactly a big time football school, but as I understand it the College Football Playoff is a recent innovation that decides who gets to eventually lose to Alabama on national television. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

3.7 kilometers
Back in October, the European Space Agency made a very, very expensive crater on Mars. The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander did indeed land, but it did so with such a velocity that it left a discernible scar on the planet rather than coming to a gentle stop on the surface. The ESA announced last week that it has figured out more details about why: A terrifically bad reading from Schiaparelli’s inertial measurement unit made the lander think it was under the Martian surface when it was actually still 3.7 kilometers above it. [Gizmodo]

17 states
California’s bar association is considering a blanket rule that would ban sexual relationships between attorneys and clients. Several attorneys are not cool with this proposal. Indeed, as of May 2015 only 17 states adopted the American Bar Association’s ban on sexual relationships between attorneys and their clients. [The Los Angeles Times]

20 countries
President elect Donald Trump has business interests in at least 20 different countries. These businesses could present conflicts of interest for the president and pose potential security threats. [The New York Times]

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro is dead at age 90. Cuba policy holds a unique place in the annals of U.S. policy discussion — Castro led Cuba over the course of 11 presidencies — so what happens next is really complicated. [FiveThirtyEight]

68 percent
Percentage of Thanksgiving Day games that involved at least one of these teams: the Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. The NFL’s decision to not always feature their best teams on Thanksgiving — we’re looking at you, Detroit — means that the quality of Thanksgiving football is less than, say, the level of basketball exhibited in the NBA’s Christmas Day slate. [FiveThirtyEight]

Percentage of middle school students who weren’t able to determine the difference between sponsored content and a real news article, according to a new Stanford University study. [The Wall Street Journal]

1,023 commutations
President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentences of 79 people imprisoned for drug-related offenses, bringing the total number of commutations he’s granted to federal inmates to 1,023. That is more than the previous 11 presidents combined. [The Washington Post]

Our coverage of the abysmal Cleveland Browns continues: The Browns have a 31 percent chance of going 0-16, according to FiveThirtyEight’s NFL Elo ratings. Is this gratuitous coverage of the Browns’ struggles due to my roommate, previously of Cleveland, failing to clean up a horrid mess left in the kitchen after preparing lemon scones this past weekend? I’ll leave that to you, dear reader, to decide. [FiveThirtyEight]

33rd best
Jurgen Klinsmann’s run as the U.S. men’s national soccer team coach officially came to an end on Monday. When Klinsmann began his tenure, the USMNT ranked as only the 34th best team in the world, according to our men’s soccer Elo ratings. We were an international joke with no hope of advancing to the top tier of global soccer. But after the U.S. soccer renaissance Klinsmann fostered, the USMNT is now sitting pretty at No. 33. The nation is eternally grateful for the progress Klinsmann achieved. [FiveThirtyEight]

$13,830,598
If $1,000 was invested in the Medallion Fund when it was created in 1988, it would now be worth $13,830,598. The fund — an investment vehicle run by hedge fund titan Renaissance Technologies — has created about $55 billion in profit over 28 years, and has unheard-of annual returns. Renaissance Technologies is one of those companies always preceded by a phrase like “notoriously secretive,” which makes this Bloomberg Markets feature on it all the more interesting. [Bloomberg]

$127.5 million
There is no feud as bareknuckled as a fine-art-world feud. In 2013, Sotheby’s sold “Christ as Salvator Mundi,” a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, on behalf of a group of art dealers. A company controlled by Swiss businessman Yves Bouvier bought the painting for $80 million. Bouvier et al then sold the painting for $127.5 million to a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev. The art dealers are now royally peeved, and are threatening to sue Sotheby’s over the roughly $47-million difference, presumably because the whole point of an auctioneer is to get the best price possible. Sotheby’s has now asked a federal judge to clear it of wrongdoing in the case. And this isn’t even the main dance: Rybolovlev is already suing Bouvier for overcharging him by at least $500 million on various other deals. [Bloomberg]

Nearly $212 million
Marijuana sales in Washington State in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $249 million sold in alcoholic spirits. [KING-TV]

261.6 billion barrels
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (a.k.a. Aramco) is the largest producer of crude oil in the world, but the state-controlled business is trying to diversify. I mean, it’s not diversifying that much — the company isn’t getting into the used-car game, or anything. But Aramco is building up its petrochemical manufacturing capabilities in an effort to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on the price of plain old oil. Still, the company says it has 261.6 billion barrels yet to come out of the ground, about 20 times as much as Exxon Mobil has, so it’s not exactly like its oil extraction business is in danger.

Massive news out of Canada: The Ottawa Redblacks defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 35-23 and will advance to battle the Calgary Stampeders for the Grey Cup next week in Toronto. If you did not understand the previous sentence, it had to do with the Canadian Football League’s championship. Anyway, don’t worry about it; I hope you have a very good Thanksgiving this Thursday. [The Associated Press]

$100,000
Cost for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for one presidential visit to New York City. With Donald Trump reportedly planning to make Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan his weekend White House, New York is staring at regular, profound gridlock. [The Washington Post]

$25 million
Trump agreed to settle a number of lawsuits related to Trump University, the failed for-profit college, for an eye-popping $25 million. Based on what former employees said under oath, the venture “used high-pressure sales tactics and employed unqualified instructors.” Two federal class action lawsuits and a suit brought by New York’s attorney general will end as part of the settlement. [The New York Times]

£369 million
Cost of renovating Buckingham Palace. (That’s nearly $460 million.) The U.K. government agreed to fund the repairs lest the landmark suffer “catastrophic building failure.” The renovations will take place over 10 years. [The Guardian]

Sen. Bernie Sanders won 18,183 write-in votes in his home state of Vermont, which has certified its presidential election results. That’s 5.7 percent of the vote, a bit more than Gary Johnson and Jill Stein earned combined. [Burlington Free Press]

34.3 percent
Percentage of U.S. cropland overseen by farms larger than 2,000 acres in 2011. In 2001, these large farms ran less than a quarter of the country’s farmland. It’s just one measure of how much American farming has consolidated. [FiveThirtyEight]

500 McDonald’s
Approximate number of McDonald’s locations in the U.S. that currently offer table service. The bring-your-burger-to-you trial has proven sufficiently successful that the fast-food giant plans to bring table service to all 14,000 or so of its domestic locations. [Buzzfeed]

Volkswagen will cut up to 30,000 jobs as a cost-saving measure — through attrition, with no forced layoffs until 2025 — as the manufacturer tries to rebound from that time they totally lied about their emissions. [Bloomberg]

$650 million
The English Premier League has reportedly inked a three-year, $650 million deal with PPTV, a Chinese broadcaster, that will extend through the 2021-2022 season. It’s likely to be the biggest overseas TV deal ever for English soccer. [Bloomberg]

Number of times Bob Dylan will go to Stockholm, Sweden, in December to accept the Nobel Prize. The Svenska Akademien (Swedish Academy) knew what they signed up for when they picked Dylan as a winner.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials announced Wednesday that the price of a MetroCard swipe could rise from $2.75 to $3.00 in March. And why not? After all, where else can you get phoned-in train service without all the amenities that come standard in every other metropolis? Where else will you find subway cars packed so tight that ass-grabbing is a given? What other transit authority could we find that treats weekend line closings as top secret? The best thing to happen to the M.T.A. is its proximity to the active fire hazard that is the Washington D.C. Metro. [The New York Times]

(The vote was so close it took a week to settle the results.) As a New Yorker, this seems insane to me. Sure, Denver residents still can’t smoke marijuana in these spaces — they can only “consume” it — but the notion of doing anything fun in public besides eating and drinking was beaten out of New York by the end of the Bloomberg Administration. [The Associated Press]

8,711,000 Facebook interactions
Number of shares, reactions and comments on Facebook generated by the top 20 fake election stories in the last three months of the campaign. Hoax sites and partisan fabulists eclipsed real news during the stretch run of the 2016 election on Facebook: There were only 7,367,000 shares, reactions and comments on the top 20 stories from 19 major, fact-based publications during the same period. Come on y’all, be a part of the solution and like us. [Buzzfeed]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. 

1 emu
Prince William County police captured an escaped emu Tuesday at about 9 a.m. in Haymarket, Virginia, and thank God for that. Australia lost a war against those gnarly birds once, and they aren’t to be underestimated. [The Washington Post]

10 weeks
President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, with a mere 10 weeks to form a government, had another batch of staff changes. The team dropped lobbyists and shed some help brought on by Chris Christie, the former transition chairman. [The Wall Street Journal]

47.9 percent conversion rate
Percentage of 2-point conversion attempts in the NFL since 2001 that were successful. That means the expected value of going for 2 is 0.96 points, which is slightly better than the expected value of just going for the point-after-touchdown kick from the 15-yard line. That expected value since the NFL moved the kick back is 0.94 to 0.95 points, but in fairness, Blair Walsh and Roberto Aguayo are in this data set and could be putting a toe on the scale. [FiveThirtyEight]

$300
Are you an Apple fanatic who needs a new and pointless way to throw money at the company? Oh, you already have an Apple Watch? Well, have I got good news for you, then: Apple is out with a new book with 450 glossy photos of Apple products through the years. Flip rectangular page with rectangular product to the next rectangular page with the next rectangular product for the cool price of $300, presumably plus Apple Care. Sheep.
Sent from my iPhone. [Wired]

17,775
U.S. highway deaths in the first six months of the year, a jump from 2015. Some experts are blaming distracted driving (apps and smartphones). [The New York Times]

$25 billion to $35 billion
Snap, Inc. — the firm behind Snapchat — filed confidentially for an initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. Expected post-IPO valuations for the company range from $25 billion to $35 billion, with some estimates going up to $40 billion. Gonna take a wild guess and assume that last estimate comes from a guy with some skin in the game here. [Bloomberg]

67 percent
According to new FBI statistics, hate crimes in the U.S. rose by 6.8 percent last year, with attacks against Muslims increasing by 67 percent. [Quartz]

69 percent
Percentage of South Africans who agree that jobs go only to “people with connections” and that that’s “a very important reason” why many other people in South Africa don’t have jobs. That figure was similarly high in other major African nations: 63 percent in Nigeria and 64 percent in Kenya. [Pew Research Center]

659 asteroids
Number of asteroids listed by the NASA Center for Near-Earth Object Studies as having some chance of hitting Earth. If it’s any consolation, the organizers of an event called “Asteroid Day” maintain that there are 1 million asteroids that could potentially strike the planet, and that we have only found a very, very small portion of them. [The New York Times]

100,000 beavers
… are doomed to die at the hands of the Argentine government. They were released into the province of Tierra del Fuego to spur the fur trade, but the beavers began reproducing and — with no natural predators — got out of hand. Argentina plans to eradicate the entire population. [BBC]

600,000 people
Over 600,000 people are directly employed in jobs related to alternative energy in the U.S., with a further 1.9 million employed in the energy efficiency industry. [FiveThirtyEight]

412 million accounts
Friend Finder Networks, which owns Cams.com, Penthouse, Stripshow, iCams and Adult Friend Finder, has been hacked. (I assume those sites are related to, respectively, climbing equipment, real estate, Broadway plays based on Sunday morning newspaper comics, Apple-compatible climbing equipment and finding acquaintances in adulthood.) More than 412 million accounts have reportedly been exposed. [The Guardian]

1 guilty verdict
The alleged ringleader behind an $18.7 million maple syrup heist in Quebec was found guilty of “theft, fraud and trafficking stolen goods” on Saturday. Twenty-six people were originally arrested in connection with the robbery. [CBC]

41 shipwrecks
Forty-one shipwrecks, all amazingly well-preserved, were found in the Black Sea. The vessels, dating from the 9th century through the 19th century, are an incredible find (for everyone except all the people who definitely died to make them possible, that is). [National Geographic]

56 years
Jackie Chan is a legend, but the films he usually makes — comedies and martial arts movies — don’t tend to win Best Picture awards at the Oscars. Still, Chan, after 56 years working in the film industry, was recognized on Saturday at the annual Governors Awards with an honorary Academy Award. [Reuters]

69 legislative chambers
With the 2016 elections in the books, the Republican Party is set to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017. And — with at least 33 governors — the party will have complete control of state government in at least 25 states. [The Washington Post]

Assembly bill 1687
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is suing California over Assembly bill 1687, a law that forces the site to remove the ages of actors should they request it. While the law was intended to reduce age discrimination, IMDb argues it’s unconstitutional, and that it’s an ineffective approach to fight ageism. [The Guardian]

2,281,155 votes
Despite gains by Republicans across the map, one incumbent GOP governor — Pat McCrory in North Carolina, who signed a law limiting the bathroom access of transgender people — may have lost his race, though it is very close. Democrat Roy Cooper has claimed victory, with 2,281,155 votes to McCrory’s 2,276,383. [The New York Times]

2 Seahawks game tickets
Cassius Marsh is a linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks and is in the middle of a nightmare: the player’s a longtime fan of the “Magic: The Gathering” card game, and somebody stole his collection of cards, which are worth $20,000 to $25,000. He’s offering two Seahawks game tickets to anyone who finds them. [The Washington Post]

5.1 points
This year the Senate races tracked remarkably well with the presidential race in a number of states, showing that Senate elections had been thoroughly nationalized. The average absolute difference between a Senate race and presidential race in 11 states to watch was a mere 5.1 percentage points, strongly influenced by Ohio and Missouri where the races did not track closely. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 percent
Smith & Wesson, which announced earlier this week that it will change its name to the highly generic American Outdoor Brands, has seen its stock tank on the news of Donald Trump’s presidency. A Donald Trump presidency means gun-owners will not perceive an immediate threat to the availability of guns, which means no fear-buoyed impulse purchases of American Outdoor Brands firearms, which in turn means a 20 percent crash in the value of the company. [Bloomberg]

63 minutes
The National Football League is considering dialing back the number of advertisements played during a game, which can be as high as 70 per game. On average, 63 minutes of an NFL telecast is ads, and the NFL is trying to stop the bleeding in its viewership numbers. [Awful Announcing]

600 hours of content
An estimate from CordCutting.com says the average Netflix subscriber watched around 600 hours of Netflix content in 2016, which is just about double the watch time for subscribers in 2011. [Business Insider]

700
Number of proposed constitutional amendments in Congress over the past 200 years that sought to change the Electoral College. None of them passed. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 terms
Sheriff Joe Arpaio has lost his job as the sheriff of Maricopa County after six terms on the job. He’ll be in court in December to face criminal charges for ignoring orders to prevent his staff from racial profiling. [Los Angeles Times]

350
Number of pieces from David Bowie’s art collection up for auction today. [Digg]

62 percent
We will be figuring out the many reasons Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency for quite some time, but it’s already clear there are some demographic groups she didn’t court. According to exit polls, she lost white women without a college degree 62 percent to 34 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

79 percent
Percentage of D.C. residents who voted in favor of a ballot measure that would support making the District a state, with a small federally-administered district in the middle housing congress and the White House. A petition will now go to Congress. [NPR]

2,000
General Motors announced it will cut shifts and lay off 2,000 workers in Ohio and Michigan in the first quarter of next year. [MarketWatch]

59.7 million
After more than a day of counting, it appears that Hillary Clinton will win the national popular vote. With some votes still coming in, she has around 59.9 million votes to Donald Trump’s 59.7 million as of right now. [New York Times]

45
Last night Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States. Read how it all went down at the FiveThirtyEight live blog. [FiveThirtyEight]

279
While the outcomes in Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire and Arizona are still being determined, Trump secured at least 279 electoral votes — smashing through Hillary Clinton’s blue wall in the midwest by taking Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as winning Florida, North Carolina and Ohio — to win his long-shot bid for the presidency. [ABC News]

9 percent
This election saw the two lead candidates fail to resonate with many young voters. Based on the CNN exit poll, 9 percent of voters ages 18-29 went for third parties. [FiveThirtyEight]

51 seats
While the New Hampshire Senate race hasn’t yet been called and Louisiana is headed for a run-off, that’s the minimum number of U.S. Senate seats the Republican party will control after last night. Senators Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin will hold their seats. [ABC News]

5 to 9 seats
Democrats are projected to gain anywhere from five to nine seats in the House of Representatives, but it’s nowhere near enough to put the GOP control of the chamber in jeopardy. [ABC News]

3 initiatives
In addition to “law and order” candidate Donald Trump, Americans craved marijuana last night as ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts and Nevada passed to legalize recreational marijuana. (We’re still waiting to hear the results of Maine’s bid to do the same.) Attempting to understand the grand motivations of this nation are futile. [The Washington Post]

Americans, go vote. And when you’re done voting, come to FiveThirtyEight for updates from our live blog all day and into the night. I’ll be representing FiveThirtyEight on ABC News’ election night live stream starting at 7 p.m. Eastern. 

5 to 20 seats
All 435 U.S. House of Representatives seats are up for election today, and the Democrats would need a 30-seat swing to gain the majority. That is very unlikely. The Cook Political Report considers 37 seats competitive, seven of which are in Democratic hands and 30 of which are GOP seats. Given the uncertainty in the polls this cycle, Cook estimates a swing of five to 20 seats to Democrats. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 polls
Of the 19 polls to come in that were conducted beginning on or after Oct. 28 (when FBI Director James Comey said he was reviewing more emails related to the case of Hillary Clinton’s email server), seven had Clinton up 4 points and an additional four had her up 3 points. Although it’s perfectly possible for polls to converge, it’s worth being skeptical because there’s some herding at this point in the cycle, since no pollster wants to get burned. [FiveThirtyEight]

13 percent
Probability that a white man without a college degree who lives in Alabama will support a Democrat, compared with a 92 percent chance that a nonwhite woman who lives in D.C. and doesn’t have a college degree will. [The Economist]

21
Heads up: It is legal to take a selfie with your ballot in 21 states, plus D.C. It is illegal in 16. Know the rules in your state. Most states also ban campaign paraphernalia such as shirts or signs. Also, my armed friends, it is explicitly illegal to take a gun into a polling place in six states. [Digg]

36 percent
Percentage of Hispanic voters who have cast early ballots in Florida who did not vote in 2012. [The New York Times]

42 ballot initiatives
When you’re voting today — seriously, go vote — spare a thought for the residents of San Francisco, who besides having to cast a ballot in races for president, senator and representative also must contend with a thorough phalanx of ballot initiatives. California is bad enough; there are 17 statewide ballot initiatives, including health care policy changes and whether to require people performing in pornographic films to wear condoms. But San Francisco slathers it on, with voters having to tackle 25 additional local ballot measures. If only there were another way, such as democratically delegating an individual to represent the interests of a given community in a body of such people who make informed choices on matters of state. [CityLab]

50.5 percent
Probability that Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Senate, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Democrats need to pick up at least four seats to have a chance of controlling the body. Close races to watch include the contests in New Hampshire, North Carolina, Missouri, Nevada and Pennsylvania. [FiveThirtyEight]

71.6 percent
Probability that Clinton will win the presidency, according to our polls-only model. The model forecasts Clinton getting 48.5 percent of the national popular vote and Donald Trump getting 45 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

5,861,223 voters
That’s how many people voted in Florida in 2000, to some notoriety. This cycle, 6,424,595 people have already voted early in the Sunshine State, with 46,270,767 voting early nationally. [Joshua Chavers, The U.S. Elections Project]

3 states
The number of states — Missouri, New Hampshire, and Nevada — where the polling average says the gap between two Senate candidates is one percentage point or smaller. Control of the Senate comes down to whether or not Democrats can flip four or more seats; we give the Democrats 57 percent odds as of early Monday morning. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 percentage points
In Nevada, more registered Democrats have turned out for early voting than registered Republicans by a six percentage point margin. In 2012, 70 percent of Nevada voters did so early, so this sizable lead could mean that the Silver State is already decided for Hillary Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 percent
Percentage of respondents to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll who said the 2016 election made them more proud of America. But seriously what kind of question is that? Like, are the 62 percent who said it made them less proud just hamming it up for the telemarketer on the other end of the line, or do they walk around their lives just ever so diminished? Kudos to the 28 percent who said “no difference either way” for just being honest about it. [The Wall Street Journal]

48.4 percent
That’s the expected share of the popular vote that Hillary Clinton is forecasted to win, based on the latest from the FiveThirtyEight model. Donald Trump is projected to get 45.3 percent, but there are a solid range of possibilities, so it’s worth checking out the model every minute of every day until you feel certain of your place in the world. [FiveThirtyEight]

868 polling places
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights did a survey of 381 of the approximately 800 counties that once had to submit their voting-rule changes to the federal government due to their history of discrimination at the polls. (A 2013 Supreme Court ruling lifted that requirement.) It found that there were 868 fewer polling places in those counties than in 2012 or 2014. That can have the effect of long lines and reduced turnout. [The Nation]

565,000
According to a University of Florida professor’s analysis, that’s the number of Hispanic voters who had cast in-person early ballots in Florida as of Saturday, double the number in 2012. Factoring in absentee ballots, 911,000 Hispanic Floridians have already voted. [The Miami Herald]

0.5 percent
When you see a shift in the polls, it’s easy to ask, “What kind of person decides to just change their vote from him to her?” or vice-versa. Well, it’s actually a little more complicated than that. Comparing the changes in presidential voting intentions in a group of 1,227 people polled in January and then in October, it’s not so much that people hop from Clinton to Trump (as 0.5 percent did) or Trump to Clinton (as 1.5 percent did) but that people jumped from Trump to Neither or Clinton to Neither and back. On the whole, few people have changed their views on the race. [FiveThirtyEight]

41 percent
Percentage of Republicans who in a New York Times/CBS News poll said they believed Donald Trump’s candidacy was bad for the GOP. This is abnormal. [The New York Times]

500 earnings calls
NFL viewership is down and it’s tough to find a single reason why. The league blames interest in the presidential race, but Bloomberg highlighted that is a rather common corporate scapegoat for poor performance: In a 90-day stretch, over 500 earning calls for companies cited some variation of “the election” regarding why their financials were what they were. [Bloomberg]

711 jobs
The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the part of the FDA tasked with approving new drugs) has a huge problem with staff retention. When a pharmaceutical company backs up a dump truck full of money for one of their employees it’s difficult to keep them around. This led to a drastic number of vacancies; the CDER had 711 openings out of only 5,525 total positions by the end of September. [Kaiser Health News]

1947
Congratulations to the Arizona Cardinals, who after the Cubs’ historic victory in the world series now have the dubious honor of owning the longest championship drought in a major American sports league. The franchise — then the Chicago Cardinals — last won the NFL championship in 1947. No pressure. [Yahoo Sports]

49.9 million
Peak viewership of Game 7 of the World Series, right as the game headed into the ninth inning. On average the game was the most watched baseball telecast since 1991. [Reliable Sources]

8-7
It’s over. The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in extra innings in the World Series. The 108-year World Series drought is over. [FiveThirtyEight]

17 minutes
Length of a rain delay during Game 7 that occurred after the tied ninth inning in Cleveland, which I’m sure bars across America are calling “the time it just rained money.” [ABC 7 Chicago]

33.7 percent
Probability Donald Trump wins the election, according to the FiveThirtyEight model at around midnight last night. [FiveThirtyEight]

39 years old
David Ross, the veteran Cubs catcher, hit a home run in the game, the last of his career. He’s the oldest person ever to hit a homer in Game 7 of a World Series. [SportsCenter, UPROXX]

$31 million
Gawker LLC reached a $31 million settlement with Hulk Hogan, ending a legal process that had the potential to last very expensive years. A jury in Florida awarded Hogan $140 million, though the former gossip site had strong potential to win on appeals. The bulk of Gawker was sold to Univision. [Reuters]

$7 billion
Facebook revenue in the third quarter of the year, buoyed by a dynamic growth rate and strong mobile performance. The company is on track for $27 billion in revenue this year. [The Wall Street Journal]

3-3
The World Series will go to Game 7 following a massive Chicago Cubs win over the Cleveland Indians last night that tied up the series 3-3. Based on our MLB predictions, Cleveland is the slight favorite to win, but anything is possible. [FiveThirtyEight]

3 108-year-olds
The Chicago Tribune, the Northbrook Star and the Wall Street Journal have each run a splashy profile of a 108-year-old Chicago native, which would make them the same age as the Cubs title drought. A Bloomberg estimate that there should only be around 25 people aged 108 in Chicago presumably means 22 papers are sitting on glowing profiles we have yet to read. [Bloomberg]

4 nights
Weird idiosyncrasy of both Trump and Clinton in this campaign: They both really like sleeping in their own beds every night. At considerable expense, each flies back from the campaign almost every night to crash at their own house. Trump stayed at a property he owned all but four of the nights in October. [POLITICO]

32 percent
FiveThirtyEight has premiered its college football predictions, and 8-0 Alabama is a 32 percent chance to win the national title. Other teams in the hunt include Clemson, Michigan and Washington. [FiveThirtyEight]

60 to 70
Last year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the folks behind the Oscars — recognized that their current membership did not reflect the nation or the industry as a whole, and sought to include more diverse members while also considering removing the voting rights of older members who has been inactive in the industry. The end result of that last drive? They’re stripping the voting rights from only 60 to 70 people, which the Academy says is “under 1 percent” of its members. At some point it goes from a necessary corrective to a cruel thing to do to a bunch of old folks, you know? [The Los Angeles Times]

$69 million
There’s an incredible political scandal going on in South Korea right now. The details are far too many to put in a significant digit – I recommend reading the full account — but the gist is that the president has been keeping company with a number of shady characters with vague affiliations to a cult and running major decisions and briefings past them. It involves a slush fund with an alleged $69 million in graft in it, corruption in higher education, a telltale selfie left on a tablet lousy with evidence, and an apoplectic South Korean populace.

We’re a week away from Election Day. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Enjoy the politics:

+4.7 points
Hillary Clinton’s national vote margin according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Clinton is performing worse than Barack Obama did in 2012 in 10 of 12 states, while her popular vote margin is on the whole generally better. This means that the chance of an electoral vote loss and a popular vote win are better for Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

32 percent
Percentage of voters in a new Morning Consult poll that said the new FBI review of Clinton emails would not have any effect on their coming vote, compared to 33 percent — most of them already against Clinton — who said it made them less likely to support her. [POLITICO]

50 theaters
AMC will open theaters in 25 cities around the country — one in each for Democrats and Republicans — to watch results come in on cable news. Or you could watch me and my colleagues on ABC Digital for free, wherever. Up to you! [The New York Times]

$766,756
Donald Trump’s campaign is disputing a charge with Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio over $766,756 in its latest filing. Good luck, Tony Fabrizio, good luck. [The New York Times]

1.5 million
Oh good god OK we are done with politics for the day. That is the number of Americans who don’t have sick leave and go to work while lousy with illness every week. Ever been to a restaurant? Consider getting on the “paid sick leave bus” next chance you get. It almost makes you wish I covered another political story rather than this bubonic crap, yeah? [The Upshot]

$600 million
Valuation of Giphy, a company that brings in no revenue but does provide instantaneous GIFs for those in need of one. The company wrapped up a $72 million fundraising round, and its GIFs — for those out of the know, the kind of file that results from a video and an image that love each other very much — are seen by over 100 million people every day.

7 percent
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui O.S.K. and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha are merging container operations. They’re the three largest shipping companies in Japan, and by the time the deal is done by July the combined company will run 256 ships and 7 percent of the world shipping market by volume. [The New York Times]

23 penalties
The Oakland Raiders set a new NFL record Sunday for penalties in a single game, racking up 23 that cost them 200 yards. The good news? They were going up against the Tampa Bay Bucs, so they won anyway. [ESPN]

42 years
A man who checked out William Shirer’s “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich” in April 1974 from the Guilderland Library returned the book last Tuesday. The late fee for such a wait would be $3,106.20, but a man such as this presumably knows to live a life on the run, dodging the law and other library enforcement authorities, and presumably set up the book drop up so they’d be sipping a cocktail on a brach in Zihuatanejo, Mexico by the time anyone was all the wiser to his escape from New York. [NBC New York]

76 percent
The Chicago Cubs saved their chances of winning the World Series by winning Game 5 of the seven-game series Sunday night. The Cleveland Indians are one game away from winning the series, the Cubs need two wins, and they’re rather evenly matched. The FiveThirtyEight MLB Elo model gives Cleveland a 76 percent chance of winning it all and the Cubs a 24 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

$10 million
Donald Trump has put a further $10 million into his campaign in the last days before election day, making his total investment in his bid for the presidency more than $66 million. As of two weeks ago, the campaign only had $16 million on hand. [POLITICO]

$70 million
A California woman was awarded $70 million after bringing a lawsuit claiming that Johnson & Johnson was negligent in making its talcum powder, arguing it caused her ovarian cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer said that using talc on genitals is potentially cancer-causing, but the science appears not to be definitive quite yet. [CBS News]

Percentage of female members of parliament interviewed by an Inter-Parliamentary Union study who reported receiving threats of death, rape and more while serving their term. The survey included 55 female members of 39 countries’ legislatures. [The Guardian]

49 percent
Percentage of white Catholic women supporting Hillary Clinton in a new survey of likely voters from PRRI; 58 percent of white Catholic men supported Donald Trump. The gender gap in terms of support for Trump is larger for white Catholics than for white mainline or evangelical Protestants, the survey found. [PRRI]

Over 50 gigabits
The last of the data from the New Horizons spacecraft’s flyby of Pluto was delivered to scientists at 5:48 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday. The spacecraft took in a ton of data quickly on its flyby in July 2015 and sent the final piece home from more than 3.1 billion miles away. [New Horizons]

Aircraft passengers seem to be getting more unruly. There were 10,854 incidents in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association, up almost 17 percent from the year before. [The Wall Street Journal]

The NFL has TV viewership issues right now, and there are a whole lot of potential reasons for that. But viewership of English Premier League soccer matches is also down 19 percent, so this could be a broader issue. [The New York Times]

62 percent
Look, when I signed up for this gig, I realized a lot of things could happen. Couple years back, if you’d told me, “Yeah, Dallas and the Eagles will fight to lead the division,” I’d say, sure, worse things have happened to better people. If you said, “There is a show about Luke Cage,” I’d revel in our good fortune but realize we’ll still never get the Hawkeye show we deserve. If you told me, “Donald Trump will win several states in his bid for the presidency,” I’d say, sure, while difficult to comprehend, that’s possible. But if you told me that the Chicago Cubs — the team that last won the championship when the Ottoman Empire was still kicking — had a 62 percent chance of winning the World Series, I’d say you were full of crap. And yet here we stand. [FiveThirtyEight]

85.7 percent
Probability that Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, according to the FiveThirtyEight polls-only model. If you want to know how Trump might win, by golly, we have that too. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of fundraisers for Trump Victory — a joint committee of the Republican Party and Donald Trump’s campaign — scheduled between now and Election Day. The committee’s last formal fundraiser was the day of the final debate. On the Democrats’ side, Hillary Clinton had her last fundraiser Tuesday in Miami, with 41 more events featuring surrogates to come. [The Washington Post]

Many of us still have two weeks of election to go. But 10 million others can put this wonderful experience behind them. That’s how many early ballots had been cast as of Tuesday night. They are the lucky ones. [U.S. Elections Project, FiveThirtyEight]

$22 million
That’s how much the Clinton campaign and its allies are spending in battleground states this week, compared to $9.8 million from the Trump camp and its allies. Ah, now those fundraising numbers from earlier make sense. In Florida alone this week, Clinton and her allies are spending $7.4 million to Camp Trump’s $3.6 million. [NBC News]

$100 million
CNN will make roughly $100 million more in TV and digital advertising revenue this year than it would expect in a typical election year. I wonder why! [NPR]

3 plays
The Oxford University Press, after an extensive analysis, will credit Christopher Marlowe as a co-author on three Shakespeare plays. The three plays in the “Henry VI” trilogy will be credited to Marlowe and Shakespeare, and if you want to know more, we try to keep things tight here, but believe me, your friend who did a lot of plays in college has a very, very, very strong opinion about this, so hit them up. [The Associated Press]

15 percent
Although it fluctuates, that’s roughly where FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only model has Donald Trump’s chances of winning the presidential race. That’s a little more bullish on the Republican’s chances than other models, and that’s because of the model’s design. If we ignored the large number of undecided votes, Trump’s chances would be 10 percent; if we calibrated the model since 2000 rather than 1972, his chances would be about 5 percent; and if we assumed states moved independently rather than having some correlation in error, that would give him less than a 1 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 percent
Health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act will rise an average of 22 percent in 2017, according to new estimates, though tax credits track with the rise in premiums. About 70 percent of people buying insurance in Obamacare marketplaces could get a plan that costs less than $75 per month in 2017, the Obama administration said. [NPR]

42 days, 6 hours, 30 minutes
Pete Kostelnick has set a world record for fastest run across America; the 29-year-old ran the 3,067 miles from San Francisco’s City Hall to New York’s in just more than 42 days. The previous record was set in 1980 at 46 days, 8 hours, 36 minutes. [Runner’s World]

Sell-through rate of Donald Trump Halloween masks, a notch above the 69 percent for Hillary Clinton masks, according to the Savers/Value Village thrift store.

10 times
The Chicago Cubs are going to the World Series for the first time since 1945. The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, when there was still an Ottoman Empire. Moreover, their victory in the National League Championship Series means the L.A. Dodgers are not going to the World Series. This is the 10th consecutive time that the Dodgers have made the postseason without making it to the World Series, a first in professional baseball! History made by both teams. [ESPN]

13.7 percent
In a typical election year, Utah should pretty much be a lock for the GOP. But it is not a typical year, and Republican Donald Trump has a 77.2 percent chance of winning Utah, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-only forecast. Nine percent of FiveThirtyEight simulations see Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the state, but 13.7 percent have it going to independent conservative Evan McMullin, a candidate previously so unknown that the web publishing platform where I’m writing this still considers his last name a typo. [FiveThirtyEight]

37.5 cents
On Nov. 1, the per-gallon gasoline tax rate in New Jersey will jump from 14.5 cents — one of the lowest in the nation — to 37.5 cents, one of the highest, to fix the state’s road system. The hike was signed into law Oct. 14, and two state senators are already trying to repeal it. [NJ.com]

500,000
The Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals estimates that there are a half-million feral and stray cats hanging around New York City, and having them here is apparently worth the horrifying cat sex noises I hear outside my apartment regularly. The cat colonies keep rodent populations down, and groups of them have been deployed to rat-heavy areas. [The Associated Press]

Percentage of pro-Clinton Twitter traffic during the first presidential debate that was derived from bots and automated accounts. That might seem like a lot until you learn that bots accounted for 33 percent of pro-Trump’s traffic. [CNN]

3 of 5
The Florida Keys and the community of Key Haven, Florida, will vote in referendums on whether to introduce genetically modified mosquitoes into a test area in an attempt to reduce the population of Aedes aegypti, the species that transmits the Zika virus. While the resolution is non-binding, three of the five members of the Mosquito Control Board have agreed to comply with the plebiscite. [FiveThirtyEight]

+7.1 points
Mitt Romney won the South by 7.1 points over Barack Obama in 2012. Donald Trump is winning in the South too, but by a mere 1.2 points. This is typified by Texas, where Donald Trump is leading by a rather slim margin for a Republican. A University of Houston poll has him up a mere 3 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

90 years old
Legendary rock musician Chuck Berry announced Tuesday that he will release his first album in 38 years. Tuesday also happens to have been Berry’s 90th birthday. Think about that next time you’re not feeling up to completing a creative task you set out to do. [The Guardian]

1987
A U.S. warship next month will visit New Zealand for the first time in three decades. In 1987, New Zealand passed a law banning ships that are powered by nuclear reactors or that carry nuclear weapons. The U.S. won’t confirm or deny the nuclear capabilities of its fleet, so the Navy hasn’t been there since. [ABC News]

Election Day is still nearly three weeks away, but Paddy Power, an Irish bookmaker, announced that it is so confident that Hillary Clinton will win the U.S. election that it will pay out more than $1 million in winnings for bets made on her victory. [PaddyPower]

2,064,538
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will face one another in their final presidential debate tonight. But the debate comes too late to change the minds of at least 2,064,538 confirmed voters.

$382,000
Based on a study from the Center for Public Integrity, about 430 people who work in journalism have donated a combined $382,000 to Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency. (The tally included donations from critics and others who don’t cover political news.) An estimated 96 percent of contributions from journalists went to Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump, who has received about $14,000. [Columbia Journalism Review]

$36.4 million
Are you in the market for a never-finished nuclear power plant from the seventies? Has Alabama got some good news for you, weirdo. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal utility, has put an incomplete Alabama nuclear plant up for auction, with bids starting at $36.4 million. The TVA spent more than $5 billion over 40 years building the twin-reactor plant, which the local mayor says is 90 percent complete. [Newser]

Number of guns previously owned by Al Capone now in the possession of the IRS, which put the mobster away for tax evasion. The IRS recently sent the wrong gun owned by Capone — one obtained in in the 1930s, not the one confiscated in a raid in 2004 — to the Mob Museum in Vegas, thus reminding the agency of the abundance of Capone-related riches in its vaults.

Sales of personal wet wipes in 2015. The industry is booming — and wreaking havoc on sewer systems.

What are the most pass-heavy teams in the NFL? FiveThirtyEight contributor Chase Stewart calculated the Adjusted Pass Ratio — the percentage of plays where a quarterback attempts a pass, is sacked or scrambles, ignoring spikes and kneel-downs — for all the teams in the NFL. Jacksonville and Kansas City come out on top, with Adjusted Pass Ratios of 70.9. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas and Tennessee are among the run-heaviest teams this season. [FiveThirtyEight]

Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday; he’s the first American to win the prize since Toni Morrison won in 1993. Don McLean must be furious. [The Guardian]

Estimated number of people employed at Donald Trump’s companies. Only a dozen have contributed more than $200 to his campaign. Maybe he’s just such a great boss that his employees can’t stand to see him leave them for the presidency. [Reuters]

The U.S. military struck three radar sites in Yemen on Wednesday after the USS Mason and USS Ponce were targeted with cruise missiles. [U.S. Defense Department, USNI News]

4 goals
Auston Matthews, the first overall pick in the NHL draft, scored four goals in his rookie debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday. He’s the first player in the modern NHL to pull that off in his debut. Oddly enough, Toronto lost the game 5-4 to the Ottawa Senators. [ESPN]

Saudi Arabia’s crude oil revenue has fallen to 334 billion riyals this year from more than 1 trillion riyals in 2011, a 68 percent drop. That’s like if the U.S. just forgot to collect most of its taxes. [Bloomberg]

Rest in peace, Samsung Galaxy Note 7. The phones were shipped to much acclaim. Then they started exploding. This was considered a flaw — I mean, not on par with the lack of a headphone jack, but a flaw nonetheless — and so the phones were recalled. The replacement phones also exploded. So now, having learned the lesson of Swamp Castle, Samsung is just discontinuing the line. [The Telegraph]

+15 points
Based on an average of recent polls, Hillary Clinton is up 15 points among women and Donald Trump is up 5 points among men. Based on this data and the FiveThirtyEight model, if only women voted in the election, Hillary Clinton would win with 458 of 538 electoral votes. If only men voted — this used to be a thing in American history, you may recall — Trump would win with 350 electoral votes. [FiveThirtyEight]

17 propositions
California is a nightmare. The state’s ruthless devotion to the plebiscite means it’s throwing a fistful of policy questions at the electorate every cycle rather than, you know, exploiting the representative democracy feature of our republic. The best-case scenario is “maybe you pass some taxes that otherwise you couldn’t have,” and the worst case is — if you ask me — an international disgrace. Anyway, Californians get to deal with 17 ballot propositions this November, asking your everyday random person whether cigarettes get more expensive, the death penalty gets repealed, and — of assuredly worldwide interest — whether pornography performers will be forced to wear rubbers. Democracy! [The Los Angeles Times]

42 percent
Percentage of Republican women serving in Congress or as governors who don’t support Donald Trump, compared with 17 percent of GOP men in those offices. Golly, I wonder what happened here. [FiveThirtyEight]

House Speaker Paul Ryan is in the unenviable position of trying to keep his job while also distancing himself and his party from Donald Trump. This is hard for Ryan because Republicans like Donald Trump way more than they like him. A YouGov poll found that Trump had a +36 percentage point net favorability rating among GOP primary voters; Ryan’s was only +16 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

One in five millennials has had a Big Mac in their lives. This is an issue for the hamburger manufacturer. The company may have made $8.6 billion in the U.S. in 2015, but the fact that I, a 26-year-old, can not name that random list of crap in a Big Mac could be an existential threat for the company long term.

And now the Australian news of the week: The most consequential trial in the history of Australia ended Thursday. Following Daniel Ricciardo’s win in the Formula One Grand Prix in Malaysia, nine Australian supporters drank in the street wearing what we in the U.S. call Speedos but the Aussies call, no joke, “budgie smugglers.” This did not go over well. They were jailed for four days but released after the nine came off as remorseful. [The National Post]

In a major international marijuana operation bust, 13 “nearly whole” female cannabis plants have been found in the home of a northern Chinese man. The man has been dead for anywhere from 2,800 to 2,400 years, and the aforementioned room is his tomb. Yeah, you just got Twilight Zoned. [NPR]

Off the news that sightings of clowns wandering the country were disturbing passersby, the head of Halloween Express’ online operations announced sales of clown masks were up more than 300 percent year over year. Many are concerned about the clowns roaming around the nation’s streets and forests and countryside, but I’ve heard of weirder fetishes you know? [My Fox 8]

Daniel Schulli, a Canadian father, won a lottery jackpot worth over $9.7 million and is refusing to tell his children until they find out about it on the news. If you have a father who is a gigantic troll and has recently upgraded his vehicle, today may be a good day to google him and find out if he’s won anything lately and is messing with you.

52 percent
Percentage of Millennials who don’t plan to get a flu shot. One young person to another, this is an awful idea and you should get a damn flu shot. A quarter of those millennials were not getting inoculated due to financial concerns. I can assure you, as a person who did not understand how health insurance worked for several years, a flu shot is worth about four beers. [Bloomberg]

5 miles
A five-mile stretch of the Great Wall of China was “restored” with ugly-looking concrete, which has been met with criticism from onlookers and now the internet. The World Heritage Site is in disrepair in portions — understandably so, it’s rather old indeed — and less than 10 percent is considered to be in good condition. [Smithsonian Magazine]

19 percent
Based on the latest from the FiveThirtyEight election model, that’s the percentage of the time that Florida provided the deciding electoral vote in simulations of the U.S. presidential election. The state is slightly leaning for Clinton, and is essentially a must-win for Donald Trump if he’s to have any hope of gaining the presidency sans unexpected results elsewhere. [FiveThirtyEight]

26 percent
Percentage of U.S. law enforcement officers employed in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, California and Hawaii. These states have one unique thing in common, which is that there is no legal authority to revoke the occupational licenses for police officers who were sacked for misconduct. This has several effects, namely being that disgraced officers can just move to a different state or a smaller municipality to get back a badge. [Reason]

50.23 percent
A plebiscite in Colombia to approve or reject a peace deal brokered over four years of negotiations with the FARC guerrilla group ended with the deal being narrowly defeated. The final numbers saw 50.23 percent of the country voting to reject the deal to 49.76 percent in favor. Voting matters. [The Guardian]

A 5-gallon bucket of gold flakes was stolen from the back of a truck in Manhattan last Thursday. The bounty of flakes was bound for a Canadian refinery. It weighed 86 pounds, so police are presumably putting out an APB for people who do not skip leg day. [Gothamist]

$915,729,293
That’s the loss declared by Donald Trump on his income tax return from the year 1995. The New York Times obtained some of the GOP presidential nominee’s tax records from an anonymous sender. That sizable loss could mean Trump potentially avoided paying any federal income tax for the three years before and the 15 years after the filing, according to IRS rules at the time. [The New York Times]

CORRECTION (Oct. 3, 10:50 a.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described tax documents obtained by The New York Times. The Times was sent several pages of Donald Trump’s 1995 state returns, not federal.

USA Today is good for a lot of things: showing up outside of your hotel room, providing an even-keeled opinion about the teams in the NFC East, offering Arby’s coupons. Add to that list, for the first time in 34 years, a stance on the presidential debate. The paper’s editorial board has never before endorsed a candidate, and it still hasn’t.

0.9 percent
Nobody wants to hear about other people’s fantasy football teams, but it is rather delightful to rip them. Last week 0.9 percent of ESPN fantasy players started Tom Brady, who is still serving a four game suspension because of Deflategate. Meanwhile, Trevor Siemian of the Denver Broncos did indeed play and was the best QB in Week 3, yet a mere 0.7 percent of players started him. I will never pass up an opportunity to mock New England fans who think a suspended Brady will still outscore players who actually take the field. [SportsCenter]

Number of times the letter “l” appears in the name Hillary, at least in the context of the Clinton running for president. This memo did not make it to Hofstra University, where all the tickets to Monday’s debate (which you can relive here) billed Donald Trump vs. some rando named Hilary Clinton. [Independent Journal Review]

35 to 40 percent
Percentage of calls to the Dept. of Veterans Affairs’ Veterans Crisis Line that go to back-up call centers, according to the hotline’s former director. The director blamed bad work habits at the call centers for the overrun, and said that people who staff the back-up centers aren’t as well-trained to handle veterans’ needs. [The Associated Press]

42.4 percent
Yesterday alone FiveThirtyEight added more than 100 state and national polls to our database as pollsters released their pre-debate findings, and dang is it close.  Hillary Clinton had an average of 42.4 percent support in our national average compared to 41.0 percent for Donald Trump. But we had a debate last night, and Nate Silver says that because Clinton won, the polls should be kinder to her in about a week. If they aren’t, that’s a very bad sign for Democrats.

Tonight is debate night, so be sure to check the site this evening for a FiveThirtyEight live blog. I’ll be on ABC News’s digital stream of the debate shortly after 8 p.m. eastern. 

2nd highest of all time
“Fruit Ninja” is a popular mobile game, in fact the second-highest selling game on iOS ever. It will also be a movie produced by New Line, because too many people decided to see “The Angry Birds Movie” and we are sinners in the hands of an angry god. [The Hollywood Reporter]

2 points ahead
The first of three nationally televised presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump happens Monday night at Hofstra University. The race slightly favors Clinton by an average of two points in national polls, and she is a 58 percent favorite to win the presidency. You can watch the debate tonight on any television that is not already playing Monday Night Football. [FiveThirtyEight]

AB 1687
On Saturday California Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 1687, which would require an entertainment database site — the biggest and most well-known being IMDb — to remove an actor’s birthdate if it’s requested by a paid subscriber. The measure was pushed by the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA to combat age discrimination. [The Hollywood Reporter]

$22,000
It took almost five months for Ted Cruz to endorse Donald Trump, his party’s nominee for president, but only six weeks to cash in and rent out his vast email list to the nominee. Politico reports that Cruz was renting his email list to Trump well before the endorsement. A rate sheet obtained by Politico indicated that Cruz charges $22,000 to send one email to 280,000 donors and $51,000 to get in the inboxes of all 1.28 million of his supporters. [Politico]

$45,000
Truman Capote’s ashes sold for $45,000 at auction on Saturday. The original estimate of the likely selling price was a mere $4,000, which strikes me as rather low for the only remains of a beloved and highly regarded author. (Not that I’ve put all that much thought into the selling of the cremated bodies of literary figures.) But while we’re on the subject, how badly do you need to mess up your will to end up in this kind of situation? [The Associated Press]

$49.6 million
“Bundlers” are people who not only contribute to a campaign but also compel their friends and network to do so as well. It’s common for presidential campaigns to acknowledge and disclose these people, and according to a Center for Public Integrity study of the Clinton bundlers, the top group of fundraisers is responsible for at least $49.6 million of the $275 million her campaign committee raised as of June 30.

7 percent
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has paid $8.2 million to businesses owned by the candidate and his family, according to an analysis of federal campaign-finance filings. That’s about 7 percent of the $119 million the campaign has spent overall. [POLITICO]

60 to 80 percent
Facebook recently told advertisers that it has been systematically overestimating the time its users spent watching videos on the site by ignoring views that lasted less than three seconds. According to a letter that ad-buying agency Publicis Media sent to clients, Facebook overestimated average viewing time by 60 to 80 percent for the two years in question. [The Wall Street Journal]

$1.16 million
The Clintons bought the house next door to theirs in Chappaqua, New York for $1.16 million. That puts them at two-thirds of a Kennedy Compound. The write-up in the Post is so full of salt you’d need to disclose it on menus. [The New York Post]

$1.6 million
The Secret Service compensates campaigns for the travel of its agents. The Clinton campaign has so far received $2.6 million, while Trump’s has received $1.6 million. But since Trump controls the company that owns the plane, he’s getting that cash personally in the end. [POLITICO]

95 million
Number of credit cards JPMorgan Chase issues annually, 60 percent of which come from a single manufacturing facility in Ohio. The company recently released the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which has substantial rewards that have credit cards obsessives — yes they exist — freaking out about the possibilities. The manufacturing facility moved two years’ worth of the cards in less than a month. [Bloomberg]

Yahoo! disclosed that hackers had stolen user information associated with 500 million accounts. The company said a “state sponsored actor” was behind the breach, which occurred in late 2014. [CNN]

A Florida man touched two adult and two calf manatees, prompting witnesses to call the police. While attempting to ride a manatee, the man chanted, “Take me to jail!” and the police happily obliged, because it is definitely illegal to harass manatees. [KAIT 8]

36.5 percent
According to a new poll, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has the backing of 36.5 percent of active-duty military service members, putting him second behind Donald Trump, at 37.6 percent. Clinton is more well regarded among officers than among enlisted personnel. The Navy put Johnson in first place, while more than half of Marines are for Trump. [The Military Times]

75 percent
A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked Americans whether they had a favorable opinion of a variety of people, organizations and entities including Barack Obama, both major political parties and the media. The highest favorable rating went to none other than Canada, which drew a positive reaction from 75 percent of respondents and a negative reaction from only 3 percent. Canada for President. [Mark Murray, via Luke Kawa]

95 percent
In 2012, 71 percent of contributions to major-party presidential candidates from donors who appear to be Jewish went to Barack Obama; 29 percent went to Mitt Romney. This time around, Jews have ditched Trump: 95 percent of money from donors who appear to be Jewish has gone to Hillary Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

2 years and 1 month
Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. The couple separated on September 15, which was a little more than two years after they married. “Is this really a significant digit?” you may ask, to which I say: In the past 10 years, these people have been on magazine covers more often than the damn barcode, Brad Pitt became national poster boy for my “When Good Beards Go Bad” campaign, and Jolie is such a great actress she made “Beowulf” watchable. So yeah, it’s germane to the national conversation. [CNN]

Share of those making more than $150,000 per year who have less than $1,000 in savings, according to a study from GoBankingRates. For those who make $100,000 to $149,999, it’s closer to half. [Bloomberg]

179,015 Canadian dollars
An employee of the Royal Canadian Mint is alleged to have stolen CA$179,015 (about $136,0000) in gold from the mint. The state’s case claims the man removed the gold, er, the old fashioned way: 7.4 ounces at a time, in his anus. [The Ottawa Citizen]

2 “stolen” bags
Ahmad Khan Rahami allegedly placed two bombs in Chelsea in Manhattan this past weekend, but the plot was partially foiled by two men snatching the bag that one of the bombs was stowed in. Two guys saw an unaccompanied suitcase, took the pressure cooker out of it — presumably the pair was all set on the home-goods front and just needed some luggage — and made off with the bag, accidentally disabling the bomb in the process. Later, two homeless men took a backpack from a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, only to find a bomb inside of it too. (They alerted police.) I am now seriously interested in how many terror plots are inadvertently broken up by people who don’t want to schlep out to IKEA for new luggage. [DNA Info]

2.5 wins
That’s how many wins the FiveThirtyEight NFL model estimated the New England Patriots would have in their first four weeks of football if they did have Tom Brady at the quarterback position. They did not, but after two wins in two games, New England is poised to beat that without Brady, and even without his backup Jimmy Garoppolo. [FiveThirtyEight]

Average age of the highways and streets in the United States. Both major-party candidates have promised higher spending on infrastructure improvements, which could be a boon for the nation’s power grid, roads and public transit systems. [The New York Times]

3500 milliampere hour battery
A bunch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones are exploding, which is bad. One reason for this is that Samsung — seeing a weak offering from competitor Apple this year — accelerated the development and production of the phone and upgraded the 3000 milliampere hour battery in the previous model to a 3500 mAh battery in the Galaxy Note 7. Honestly, though, a phone that may or may not explode still seems like a more sensible investment than one without a headphone jack. [Bloomberg]

Nielsen’s Subscription Video On Demand Content Ratings — which claim to assign previously impossible-to-determine numbers to streaming video performance on services like Netflix — has had eight networks and production studios (A&E Networks, Lions Gate, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. among them) sign up. Netflix, which enjoys its current status as a black box, says Nielsen’s numbers aren’t accurate. [Bloomberg]

Percentage of kids who said they preferred watching videos on a non-television device in 2016, according to researcher EMarketer, potentially one component fuelling the rise of YouTube’s kid influencer channels.

On Tuesday a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the Trump administration from implementing a ban on travelers from the countries of Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad and Somalia that was set to go into effect today. The granting of Hawaii’s request for a temporary restraining order nationwide does not effect the ban on North Korea and Venezuelan citizens’ travel. [The Washington Post]

Two Chicago law enforcement officers were fired, one resigned, and a fourth received a five-day suspension (shortened on appeal to two days) for the incident at O’Hare International Airport in April in which 69-year-old Dr. David Dao was taken off an overbooked United Airlines flight. The report from Chicago’s Inspector General on the “violent forcible removal” indicates that the officers made misleading statements when describing the events. [NBC News]

3 hours, 35 minutes
Awful news: There’s more baseball than there was last year. The average time for a nine-inning playoff game is up 10 minutes from last year and up 21 minutes from two years ago. As a person who on the whole would enjoy less baseball — not no baseball, just a little bit less of it — this is very much a move in the wrong direction as far as I’m concerned. [ESPN]

The team anticipated this would be a rebuilding year; they’re now one of the four teams still in contention for the World Series title. What’s more, they appear to have many prospects developing now that will fuel the organization for years to come, regardless of how this year shakes out. [ESPN]

1.17 billion pounds
Amount of money earned by the fixed-odds betting terminals in shops around the United Kingdom. The terminals allow users to bet 100 pounds every 20 seconds. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is considering cutting the maximum allowed wager in an effort to lessen problem gambling in the country, but it would come at a major cost to the owners of those machines. On average, investors surveyed believed the maximum bet would drop to 14.50 pounds. [Bloomberg]

$8 billion
Netflix wants to make half its library original content by 2018, and in order to do so will spend $8 billion next year producing 30 new anime series and 80 original films. For those at home who have lost count, there are only 52 weeks in a given year, which means Netflix will be putting out content at an unheard of clip. [The Verge]

19 percent
Percentage of apparel sales that were made online in 2016, up 11 percent in five years. Amazon is poised to enter the sportswear business, according to sources in the industry, news that initially depressed the stock prices of some companies already in the athletic apparel business. [Bloomberg]

31 years old
Austria is poised to have the youngest leader in Europe following elections there Sunday. Conservative Sebastian Kurz, 31, is expected to attempt to form a coalition with a far-right populist party.

6,663 inmates
Over about one month, 6,663 inmates in Texas contributed a cumulative $53,863 towards Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, which is serious charity from the group, many of whom typically have less than $5 in their commissary accounts. [The New York Times]

360,000 claims
Approximate number of automobile and truck damage claims in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. That tally is roughly equivalent to one-quarter of the new vehicles sold in the month of August in the United States. [Bloomberg]

49 percent
That’s Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s approval rating in California as of a late March poll, 7 points down from the previous year. Feinstein votes with President Trump’s priorities more often than we would expect from a typical senator from California, where the president lost by 30 points, which is one potential reason Kevin de Leon, the president of the California state senate, appears poised to challenger her in a primary. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of characters created on D&D Beyond from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 who were fighters, by far the most common class, followed by rogue, wizard, barbarian and cleric.

$7 billion
POLITICO is reporting that President Trump intends to end the subsity payments to private insurers that lower medical costs for 5.9 million Americans who otherwise would not be able to afford health insurance coverage. If that holds, premiums will rise and the deficit will increase, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. [POLITICO, The New York Times]

26 percent down
The Tonight Show on NBC’s ratings have dropped substantially while rivals — Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” and Jimmy Kimmel’s “Live” — are increasingly winning late night. Fallon’s ratings are down 26 percent last week compared to the same period last year. It’s a shame that topical, incisive comedy is beating out the comedic stylings of Jimmy Fallon — from the iconic Lick it For Ten to the hard-hitting but fair Competitive Spit Takes. [Vulture]

62 percent
At the top 75 Silicon Valley companies women comprise only 23 percent of technical roles. While that sector can be rather fond of deflecting blame, Sephora — the global cosmetics conglomerate — is putting them to shame when it comes to developing and rewarding that kind of talent, as seen with 62 percent of the firm’s technology ranks being women. [The Wall Street Journal]

$180,000 per year
Yearly salary that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore received from the Foundation for Moral Law. Moore had preciously claimed he did not take a salary because he did not want to be a burden for the network of donors. Nonetheless he got over a million dollars in compensation from 2007 to 2012. [The Washington Post]

200,000 meals a day
FEMA is providing 200,000 meals a day to Puerto Rico, but officials acknowledge there are 2 million people who need food meaning there’s at least a daily shortfall of 1.8 million to 2.8 million meals ever day. [The Guardian]

$621 million
Amount of money New York doles out in film and television subsidies every year. All told, it’s pretty vague who benefits from this: On one hand, production does come to New York, on the other it’s unclear exactly if the economy comes out ahead, but most of all I saw my bodega once on “Orange Is The New Black” and it threw me for a loop for days.

The shareholder vote over control of a board seat of Procter & Gamble came down to the wire, with the current board declaring victory over Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who wants to shake up the home goods company. The vote total is reportedly plus or minus one percentage point, and Peltz wants a recount. [The New York Times]

2-1, Trinidad and Tobago
With a loss to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday, the U.S. Men’s national team has been eliminated from qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. The staggering failure is the first time since 1986 the U.S. will be absent from world soccer’s biggest event. [ESPN FC]

31 percent
More and more Americans are identifying as religiously unaffiliated, but it’s not college that’s causing that. A PRRI study found 38 percent of young adults and 24 percent of Americans in general are religiously unaffiliated, but many of those young people are already religiously unaffiliated before showing up to their first college class: The UCLA Freshman Survey found 31 percent of incoming students were unaffiliated. [FiveThirtyEight]

89 percent cut
Michigan Consumers for Health Care, which helps enroll people in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, have seen the Trump administration slash funding for the work by 89 percent, from $1.2 million to $129,000. The cuts are affecting other organizations across the country: The Ohio Association of Foodbanks was hit with a 71 percent cut, Wyoming’s Cheyenne Regional Medical Center saw a 61 percent cut, the Utah Health Policy Project got a 61 percent cut, and the Palmetto Project in South Carolina saw a 46 percent cut.

20,000 acres
Fires in California north of San Francisco consumed 20,000 acres Monday in 12 hours. The fires have claimed 15 lives and more than 119,000 acres burned so far. The flames are being fueled by powerful winds, and no rain is forecasted in the next seven days. [CNN]

$133 million
Kobe Steel, the third-largest steel company in Japan, is engulfed in scandal after it said staff falsified data about the durability and strength of the aluminum and copper it sold. The metals have gone on to be used by Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Subaru Corp and used in trains, planes, and possibly spacecraft. One estimate for the cost of replacing the metals is $133 million, but shares for the company already dropped 22 percent and investors are worried the about the risk of the company defaulting on its debts.

14 of 20 launches

1,000 ex-ISIS fighters

In the other, Nelson Peltz, who owns $3.5 billion of that and wants a board seat so he can carry out a plan to overhaul the company. There are 600 people working on the election, and both sides have disclosed they’re going to spend a combined $60 million on the campaign. [The New York Times]

13 percent
Beer sales for Constellation Brands — the domestic distributor of Corona and Modelo — were up 13 percent over the summer despite sales of domestic beer being down. American love of Mexican beer has led to a solid 36 percent boost for the company’s stock this year. [The Wall Street Journal]

20 percent
The board of the Weinstein Company has fired Harvey Weinstein after a sexual harassment scandal stemming from a New York Times investigation showed evidence of sexual misconduct towards employees and entertainment industry colleagues stretching back decades. Weinstein controls around 20 percent of the production company and reportedly resisted being removed. [Variety]

Marital status is increasingly related to wealth: In 1990, according to the AEI research, 51 percent of poor, 57 percent of working class and 65 percent of middle and upper class adults aged 18 to 55 are married. Today, only 26 percent of poor Americans aged 18 to 55 are married, while 39 percent of working class and 56 percent of the latter groups are hitched. [The Guardian]

$242,500
Estimated gross cost to taxpayers for Vice President Mike Pence to fly a C-32 from Las Vegas to Indianapolis and then to Los Angeles Sunday. The purpose of the trip was so that he could briefly attend and then promptly leave an Indianapolis Colts game citing the ongoing NFL players’ protest of police mistreatment of African-Americans. The RNC will reimburse the government for a portion of the cost of the L.A. leg because the Vice President attended a political event there. [CNN]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has changed a federal policy with a memo to agency heads and U.S. attorneys indicating that Title VII’s sex discrimination protections do not apply to transgender workers. This could lead to court cases. [BuzzFeed]

31 percent
President Trump said in front of a microphone on Tuesday that when it comes to Puerto Rico’s debt, “We’re going to have to wipe that out.” This seemingly off-hand comment — his budget director later attempted to walk back the statement — led the price of Puerto Rico’s bonds to fall 31 percent, though they then began to recover. [NPR]

2048
A man was arrested Monday in central Wyoming for public intoxication, or at least that’s what the feds and black helicopters would have you believe. The man claimed to be a time traveller from the year 2048. He warned that aliens would arrive next year, demanded to speak to the president of Casper and said it was the aliens that had filled his body with alcohol.

940,000 metric tons of butter
American consumption of butter is projected to be up 10 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, with an expected 940,000 metric tons consumed. Fun fact: Grassland Dairy Products Inc. — a company you probably have never heard of — makes about a third of U.S. butter, and Americans ditching margarine for the good stuff made the guy who owns it a hella billionaire.

5 consecutive Emmys
Julia Louis-Dreyfus on Sunday evening won her fifth consecutive Emmy Award for best actress in a comedy for playing Selina Meyer on “Veep.” Over a long career excelling in a rare variety of roles, Louis-Dreyfus is already one of the most accomplished actresses in the history of television.

When you look back on the styles of the summer of 2016, do you think “cargo shorts?” Maybe you should; 15 percent of new shorts styles that went up for sale at online retailers were of the cargo-short variety, up from 11 percent in 2015. At this rate, by 2037 more than 100 percent of all new shorts will be cargo shorts, so now is the time to panic. [Bloomberg]

33 episodes
Netflix announced it will cancel “Bloodline” after its third season. One likely contributing factor is that Netflix spent a fortune on the show — Vulture estimates the three seasons will cost a quarter billion, give or take — and the company is interested in developing other properties that could gather awards. Sidebar: Congratulations to Ben Mendelsohn of “Bloodline,” who won the only acting Emmy award — Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series — for Netflix last night. Sorry that your show got cancelled, and I’m sure that “House of Cards” will finally deliver for Netflix next year. [Vulture]

The bottom 49 percent of smartphone users download zero apps on average per month. The top 13 percent of users account for half of all app downloads in a month.

1.5 inches wide
Have you bought bacon in America recently? All right, so have you noticed how from the front the shingle-style packed bacon looks like it doesn’t have a ton of fat, but when you look at the little window in the back of the package you can scope out the real deal? Fun fact, that window is federally mandated by U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations from the early ’70s. The window is required to be at least 1.5 inches wide and to show 70 percent of the length of the bacon. Neat! [Bloomberg]

40 percent
A former San Diego resident saved a species by having sex with six tortoises hundreds of times. That’s right, Diego (a giant tortoise) was sent from the San Diego Zoo back to the Galapagos Islands about 50 years ago to kick-start a breeding program when there were only two males of his species left on one of the islands. In the intervening period, 2,000 tortoises — 40 percent of which were fathered by Diego — have been released into the wild on the island, and the species is not on the brink of extinction anymore. [Metro]

44.5 percent
Percentage of complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that cited retaliation in 2015, up from 22.6 percent in 1997. While factors including race, sex and age discrimination have remained generally flat as a percentage of claims over the same period, “retaliation” — as in firing or demoting someone because  they complained or filed for discrimination — is steadily growing. [NPR]

400 kiosks
New York City is replacing its vestigial phone booths with Wi-Fi kiosks. Still, after a number of incidents, web browsing will be disabled on 400 LinkNYC kiosks because — gasps — people were using them to watch pornography. This raises a series of questions: Have the people who envisioned this system been to New York City? Are they, as I am now imagining, all Helen Lovejoy from “The Simpsons”? Did they peek inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal one day and conclude, “Yes,” scratching their chins, “a free Wi-Fi portal here will encourage people to engage more with city events and local night life?” [The Guardian]

$1.6 billion
Ford announced that it will move production of all of its small cars to Mexico, where it’s building a $1.6 billion assembly plant. This means that, given the current national political conversation, we can now confirm for a fact that The Ford Motor Company is not even remotely able to read the room.

5 meteorologists
It seems like this happens every year, but five Russian meteorologists are surrounded by polar bears and trapped at a remote weather station on a frozen island. Sources indicate that the scientists recently ran out of the flares they were using to scare away the beasts, which in meteorology is considered a real bummer. A weather bureau 1,200 miles away plans to send more flares soon. [NBC News]

5.2 percent
The U.S. Census Bureau announced Tuesday that median household incomes in 2015 saw the largest year-over-year growth since the start of the survey in 1968, a 5.2 percent jump to $56,516. [FiveThirtyEight]

23 percent
Increase in motorcycle deaths in Michigan from 2014 to 2015, according to a road safety study that linked the uptick to a 2012 law that repealed the requirement for motorcyclists to wear a helmet. The sponsor of that bill, state Rep. Peter Pettalia, was killed Monday in a motorcycle crash. He was wearing a helmet. [Michigan Radio]

Colorado sold $122.7 million in medical and recreational marijuana in July, a 27 percent year-over-year jump from that month in 2015. The recreational market accounted for a little more than two-thirds of the sales. [The Denver Post]

70-2
The Tennessee House of Representatives has expelled a legislator over alleged sexual misconduct. The chamber voted 70-2 to kick out Jeremy Durham, who has been accused of inappropriate conduct with nearly two dozen women. [The Tennessean]

90 percent
Congress mandated that NASA find 90 percent of the nearby asteroids that measure at least 460 feet across — the kind that could wreak havoc if they ever hit Earth — by 2020. NASA has now found 20 percent to 25 percent of the 25,000 estimated to fit that bill, and the agency won’t hit the target without more funding. If you are a wealthy supervillain interested in funding the U.S. space program, well, have I got an arbitrage opportunity for you. [FiveThirtyEight]

CORRECTION (Sept. 14, 10:45 a.m.): According to a correction attached to a linked article, an earlier version of an item misstated the number of asteroids measuring at least 460 feet across that scientists believe are near Earth. There are thought to be about 25,000, not 125,000.

In light of the effects of the controversial North Carolina legislation that removes protections for transgender people from local ordinances and forces people to use the restroom of the gender they were designated at birth, the NCAA will move seven planned events from North Carolina in 2016-17.

On Monday, the BBC, which broadcast the show, lost the rights to Channel 4. More people watched that finale than watched the Olympics on the BBC. I want to know two things, people: Does this mess with America getting to see more “The Great British Bake Off,” and also what the hell is fondant? Mary Berry never cleared that up. [Variety]

Nelly did not pay some taxes and owes the federal government $2,412,283. Not paying taxes is a poor financial plan in general. But! Fans of the rapper are doing literally the least they can do and are streaming “Hot in Herre” on repeat from streaming services. By Spin’s estimation, at the most lucrative option of $0.0084 per stream, fans will need to play the song at least 287,176,547 times to get him back in the government’s good graces. [Spin]

A fire suppression system test at an ING Bank data center in Bucharest, Romania, severely damaged the hardware, throwing the bank’s services offline. In a data center, conventional fire suppression systems — you know, like spraying a bunch of water — are bad ideas given the whole “this will kill everything on the server” properties of water. So instead they have these neat systems that pump in inert gases to snuff out the flame. The issue in Bucharest was that the gases fired out so quickly during the test that they made a really loud noise — more than 130 decibels — which vibrated and shattered a whole lot of hard drives. The future is weird. [Motherboard]

$20,000
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump uses money raised by his foundation for some rather interesting “charitable” purposes. For instance, he spent $20,000 in foundation money on a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. [The Washington Post]

$650 million
Back in February, the Obama administration requested $1.9 billion in funding to fight Zika, but Congress didn’t deliver. After that, the president shifted $650 million from other sources to cover the costs as a stopgap measure. That money is about to run out. [The Associated Press]

$2.45 billion
A $2.45 billion Department of Transportation loan to Amtrak will allow the passenger rail service to buy new trains for the Acela Express route, improve stations and rail on the Northeast Corridor, and eventually get Acela trains running every half-hour between Washington and New York during the busiest times of day.

5 nuclear tests
The U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.3 earthquake early on Friday. The earthquake happened to be observed right near a nuclear weapons test site in North Korea. Indeed, hours later North Korea confirmed that it had conducted a fifth nuclear test. [The Wall Street Journal]

59 percent
With Serena Williams losing in the semifinals, German Angelique Kerber is now the favorite to win the U.S. Open, with a 59 percent chance of doing so according to FiveThirtyEight’s U.S. Open predictions (brought to you by Chase). [FiveThirtyEight]

226 complaints
A Bloomberg analysis found that, since 2008, the 150 largest tech companies in Silicon Valley have faced 226 age discrimination complaints filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. There were more complaints regarding age than even race or gender bias. [Bloomberg]

5,300 employees
Wells Fargo has fired 5,300 employees in the past several years for creating unauthorized banking and credit card accounts for unwitting customers — all to earn more fees and up sales figures. Employees filed 565,443 credit card applications in customers’ names without the customers knowing. [CNN]

$100,000
Signing bonus the New York Mets paid to Tim Tebow, who was a not-very-good NFL quarterback but wants to roll the dice playing baseball apparently. That’s the highest bonus a team can give to a post-draft signing without getting penalized. Tebow will play for the Mets’ instructional team. In far better news, football is back! [CBS Sports]

$21.6 million
Amount raised in August by Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton. Priorities has raised $161 million in the election cycle so far. [The New York Times]

19 percent
A new report from Oceana, an environmental group, found that an estimated 19 percent of fish products purchased in restaurants and retail locations were not the fish they claimed to be. Incredulous patrons were left doubting other things they had taken for granted, such as “who really lives in a pineapple under the sea?” [Quartz]

31.4 percent
Of the 4,370 speaking characters in the top 100 grossing films of 2015, only 31.4 percent were women. That’s crazy. This obscenely low figure has varied only slightly since 2007. [FiveThirtyEight]

70 years
A 70-year-old man robbed a Kansas City bank, then sat down in the lobby rather than flee with his money. He told police that he did it because he would rather live in a jail cell than with his wife, with whom he’d had an argument. The cartoonist behind “The Lockhorns” is presumably furious over being scooped on this one. [Kansas City Star]

80 percent
Of the nearly five million students in U.S. public schools that show signs of a mental health disorder, 80 percent will not receive counseling, medication or any kind of treatment for it. [NPR]

SB 277
A California law, SB 277 — which forbids parents from sending unimmunized children to school — went into effect in July. And with kids now going back to school, the first wave of parents affected by the law will have to decide whether to tutor kids at home, leave California or vaccinate their dang kids.

60 percent
Probability Serena Williams wins the U.S. Open, according FiveThirtyEight’s U.S. Open predictions, sponsored by Chase. Williams has an 80 percent chance of defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals today. Still, don’t count competitors like Angelique Kerber out: The German has a 74 percent chance of winning her semifinal match and a 22 percent of winning the final. On the men’s side, Novak Djokovic is the heavy favorite, with a 90 percent chance of advancing to the final over Gael Monfils and a 70 percent chance of winning it all. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 percent
More than 80 percent of India is reached by a new 4G mobile network called Jio — bankrolled by India’s richest man — which will be free to use until the end of the year. The price will jump to at least $2.25 per month next year, but the rock bottom price is a play to undercut competitors for the market. [CNN Money]

520,000 metric tons
Do you like pistachios? Then it’s time to PANIC! World pistachio production will drop 86,000 metric tons in 2016 compared to last year, to 520,000 metric tons, according to the USDA. This is largely due to droughts in California, cutting U.S. production by half. [USDA, Gizmodo]

$20 million
21st Century Fox, which owns Fox News, paid $20 million to settle Gretchen Carlson’s sexual harassment lawsuit against the network’s former chairman, Roger Ailes. Moments after the announcement of that settlement, Greta Van Susteren, another Fox News host, left the company. [The New York Times]

$153 million
ITT Technical Institute, a for-profit college, shut down more than 130 campuses and laid off the “overwhelming majority” of its employees. The Department of Education had ruled that ITT would need to produce $153 million in additional collateral — on top of the $78 million it had on hand — to cover losses if it failed (the government feared being left on the hook). ITT is facing a suite of lawsuits, from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Massachusetts attorney general, regarding allegations it misled students.

19 chemicals
The Food and Drug Administration is banning all antimicrobial soaps containing any of 19 specified chemicals. The FDA’s ruling comes on the heels of research suggesting that the soaps don’t pose a major benefit to users and could help develop bacteria with resistance to antibiotics. [Ars Technica]

19 percent
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, hails from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. And yet the Christian Democrats, Merkel’s party, saw a major defeat on her home turf, finishing third, with 19 percent of the vote, in state elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday. The results would seem to be a rebuke of Merkel’s refugee policy: Her center-right party was outflanked on the right by Alternative for Germany, an anti-migrant party that took second place and 21 percent of the vote. [The New York Times]

On average, teachers in the U.S. make 78.6 percent of what other workers with the same level of education make. [Bloomberg]

How much money should you spend on a gift when someone in your immediate family is getting married? Respondents to a SurveyMonkey poll spent, on average, $147. That drops to an average of $82 on a wedding gift for a close friend and $71 for a member of their extended family. [FiveThirtyEight]

$17.6 million
Money paid to Bill Clinton over five years, from 2010 to 2015, by Laureate International Universities, a network of for-profit colleges. Clinton worked as a consultant and “honorary chancellor” for the company. [Washington Post]

1 minute, 15 seconds
IBM’s Watson — our computer overlord that was welcomed in 2011 by Ken Jennings on “Jeopardy!” — is now in the movie business. The artificially intelligent Watson helped cut a 1 minute, 15 second trailer for 20th Century Fox’s upcoming horror flick “Morgan.” Using visual and audio analyses, the system identified moments from the film that were especially frightening, and a human editor spliced them into a comprehensible preview. [TechCrunch]

150 hours of commercials
Television commercials are an indelible part of childhood. Whether it’s cowboys obsessed with picante sauce, the virtues of savory microwavable pastries, or hallucinogenic zebra gum, TV ads are the gooey medium that is still the mortar for my fragile, 30-something psyche. However, a troubling new study from Exstreamist estimates that today’s children are spared 150 hours of commercials a year, thanks to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. I weep for the future. [Engadget]

178 years later
In 1838, Jesuit priests sold 272 slaves to shore up the struggling finances of Georgetown University. Yesterday the university announced a plan to offer preferential status in admissions to the descendants of the slaves whose forced labor benefited (and physically built) the school. The recompense will also include a formal apology, a new institute for the study of slavery, and renamed campus buildings — but no financial assistance. [The New York Times]

2,271 words
If you sign up to volunteer making phone calls for the Donald Trump campaign, you might want to retain counsel. Would-be volunteers are required to sign an unusual 2,271-word non-disclosure agreement. Among its stipulations: A volunteer must promise not to disparage Trump “during the term of your service and at all times thereafter.” For-ev-er. [The Cincinnati Enquirer]

$143 million
Hillary Clinton’s august August fundraisers garnered $143 million for her campaign and the Democratic Party, more than any month so far this cycle. She’s had better luck than me in the Hamptons. The last time I was there, Paul McCartney was conspicuously absent, I danced alone and all I took home was a sunburn. [The Washington Post]

$915.6 million
It’s summertime, but the livin’ isn’t so easy for Hollywood. Summer typically generates about 40 percent of yearly moviegoing sales, but this year, of the 32 movies released by the six major studios, 17 of them lost a combined $915.6 million. It might be time to ask Watson if it knows how to direct. [Bloomberg]

Remember that time we landed a probe on a comet? Well, we’re doing it again! The Rosetta mission is coming to a close, and the Rosetta orbiter should join its companion Philae as residents of the 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko comet at the end of September. Rosetta came within 4.4 kilometers of the comet during its most recent approach. You can follow Rosetta’s progress here. [The Planetary Society]

Field goals converted from 50 or more yards at the half-way point in the Canadian Football League this year. In 2015, they made 19 all season. In 2014, they made seven. (It’s almost as if kickers are getting better.) [TSN]

Wins in one-run games by the Texas Rangers this season. Their .789 winning percentage in such games would be the highest of all time. [FiveThirtyEight]

100 percent
Odds that Mexico will pay for the “great wall” Donald Trump wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico, according to Donald Trump. Or possibly the share of the cost that Mexico will pay — I can’t really tell. Maybe Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto can shed some light for us. [Los Angeles Times]

Age of microbial fossils discovered by Australian geologists in Greenland. (And yes, they say “3,700-million,” not 3.7 billion. Because science.) This means life may have evolved even earlier than we previously thought, and may be even more common than we previously thought. Which, if you believe in the Great Filter, is very bad news.

About eight bucks will buy you the new “Dakburger,” at Snuffer’s, a Dallas-area restaurant chain. The burger is named after Dak Prescott, the Dallas Cowboys’ rookie quarterback who fans are desperately deluding themselves into thinking is their savior by doing things like naming a burger after him. [Dallas News]

111 prisoners
President Obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 inmates Tuesday, most of them nonviolent drug offenders who would receive much lighter sentences were they convicted today. Obama has now granted 673 commutations, more than the past 10 presidents combined. [NPR]

444 runs
Here’s how the BBC puts it: “Alex Hales struck a record 171 and Jos Buttler made England’s fastest ever 50 from 22 balls as England hit 444-3.” And here’s my translation: 444 is the highest ever score in a one-day cricket match. And I guess Alex Hales is really, really good. [BBC]

$2 billion
How much is it worth to have the U.S. government as a customer? For the private prison industry, at least $2 billion. After the Department of Justice announced it would no longer use private prison companies for federal inmates, and after the Department of Homeland Security said it was also looking into ending its use of private detention centers, two private prison companies lost over $2 billion in value.

1 in 300
A new study out of the University of Texas Medical Branch shows that female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can pass the Zika virus to their offspring, which is not great news. The researchers found that it was no sure thing, however — the virus was passed down at a rate of 1 in 300 mosquitoes. But that could still be a problem because mosquito populations are pretty huge.

Well, dear readers, we now know the price of a New York minute. It’s 56 bucks, which is about how much more New Yorkers will pay per month in rent, on average, to live one single minute closer by subway to Manhattan’s business districts. After you shelled out the cash, what would you do with your extra minute? Sleep in? Linger over your oatmeal with a loved one? Toss in another $56 a month to avoid a tongue lashing from Kevin Spacey?

Canada brought back its mandatory long-form census this year (in case you needed a data-related reason to love Justin Trudeau), and the response rate was an impressive 97.8 percent. The overall response rate for both the long and short versions was 98.4 percent. CBC News quoted chief statistician Wayne Smith as saying this year’s census was the “best census since 1666.” [CBC News, h/t @JordanElder]

300+ dead reindeer
A couple of you tweeted me the weird story of the more than 300 reindeer that were killed by lightning at a national park in Norway. You already made the angry Santa jokes, so instead I’ll say that I hope the hallucinogenic shrooms took the edge off. [National Geographic]

HD164595
Back in May 2015, a radio telescope in Russia detected a signal from star HD164595, which is a cool 95 light-years away and is about the same size as our sun. It’s kind of unclear why no one said anything until now; the scientists who recorded it attracted attention when they gave a talk about the signal. And it’s way, way too early to say whether this is a sign of extraterrestrial life. That said, if it is the SETI Institute has protocols in place for what it believes should happen next.

Six people have just emerged from a 20-foot tall, 36-foot in diameter dome in Hawaii after a year in isolation. They were there helping NASA plan for a mission to Mars. I, meanwhile, have spent two years in a 200-square-foot New York apartment, emerging only occasionally for sandwiches from the corner bodega. NASA: Call me. [Guardian]

12 seconds
A typical NASCAR pitstop takes about 12 seconds. That’s several seconds faster than the typical pitstop in the early 2000s. Former college baseball, basketball and football athletes are increasingly being recruited into auto racing, and perfecting the complex, physically demanding ballet that is competitive auto maintenance. [The New Yorker]

30-hour workweek
Amazon, which has sometimes been criticized for its break-neck work culture, is experimenting with a few technical teams of part-time, 30-hour-a-week workers. The teams will work from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., plus “flex hours,” and garner the same benefits as full-time employees. There’s a hope that the arrangement could attract more female employees, who tend to shoulder more household and child-care responsibilities. [The Washington Post]

55 percent chance
Over the next two weeks, thousands will descend upon the Flushing neighborhood of Queens, New York, to sit in bleachers, wear shorts, sweat all over each other and drink vodka cocktails. There will also be a major tennis tournament taking place. It’s a tournament — the U.S. Open — that Serena Williams has a 55 percent chance to win, according to our predictions. It would be Williams’s 23rd major, an Open-era record. The favorite on the men’s side is Novak Djokovic, with a 57 percent shot at the championship. [FiveThirtyEight]

6.2 million dead butterflies
Storms in Mexico earlier this year brought unusual rain, cold and wind, destroying 133 acres of forest and killing 6.2 million monarch butterflies that were wintering there. That’s over 7 percent of the 84 million butterflies that winter in the area. Last December, they covered some 10 acres. That’s up from their record-low 1.7 acres in 2013, but down from the 44 acres they covered 20 years ago. [The Weather Channel]

130 million ash trees
The emerald ash borer is killing trees and causing major problems. The borers, small green beetles, have infected 130 million ash trees in about 6 million acres of New York forest. Beyond the ecological devastation, the insects could have a significant effect in the world of sport. While maple, for example, has been increasing in popularity in baseball, about a quarter of major league bats are made out of white ash. [The New York Times]

1 box of crickets
Did you know that any honest American subway car is a mere box full of crickets away from complete and utter catastrophe at any given time? This theorem was demonstrated to devastating effect Wednesday evening in New York City, on a D train going over the Manhattan Bridge. A woman was trying to sell crickets and worms to people on the train, because sure, why not, the history of capitalism is chock-full of innovators who not only discovered but created markets. Anyway, this pitch flops, and then a bunch of teenagers — because of course it’s teenagers — pushed her, leading the small businesswoman to dump the box full of crickets and worms in the car, I don’t know, maybe to demonstrate the vitality of the stock. So everybody freaks out, obviously, the crickets are just everywhere, and some wannabe Moses tries to end the plague by deciding to pull the emergency brake, which means that the train is stuck on the bridge for half an hour rather than proceeding to its eventual destination. [The New York Post, via John Carney]

3 tablespoons white pepper
An heir to Colonel Sanders may have given the super secret recipe for the notorious eleven herbs and spices in the KFC batter to a reporter, which is the one thing you’re not supposed to do. The key is apparently white pepper. You need 3 tablespoons of it. [The New York Times]

5 percent
Some scientists put a bunch of kids on standing desks and then compared them to a control group. It’s one study, with only 400 participants, and found a slight (5 percent) change in BMI of the standing desk kids, which obviously means it’s time to overhaul our entire educational system to make sure everyone is using a standing desk. Of course the researcher behind it founded a standing desk company for schools. [Bloomberg]

21 percent
According to a study published in American Journal of Public Health,  consumption of soda decreased 21 percent a year after the city of Berkeley implemented a soda tax. Fittingly, we found out about this news from [Bloomberg].

38 percent
Percentage of Americans who believed the Federal Reserve was doing a good or excellent job in November of 2014, compared to 53 percent who said as much in 2003. Golly, I wonder what might have shaken their faith. [The Wall Street Journal]

Pay increase for Heather Bresch over the past 9 years. Bresch is the CEO of Mylan, the pharmaceutical company that’s in the news for hiking the price of several drugs including the EpiPen. Given that people with certain allergies need EpiPens in order to not die in agony of anaphylactic shock, people are understandably miffed at Mylan for raising the price from $56.64 in 2007 to $317.82 today.

3,964
Number of copies of Donald Trump’s book “Crippled America” that the Trump campaign bought from a New York Barnes & Noble on May 10. The purchases juiced the sales to the point that the tome was on the Nielsen bestseller list. This is not precisely kosher: If Trump profited from the sales, that could be a violation of federal campaign finance law. [The Daily Beast]

436,484 voters
Much has been made of an increase in Republican Party registrations and a potential buoying effect it could have on the Trump campaign. Registration for Democrats has dropped since 2012 in a number of key swing states, but a close look at voter registration figures led my colleague David Wasserman to conclude that those losses haven’t generally translated into gains for the GOP. Florida, for example, has added 436,484 voters since 2012, but nonwhites — who tend not to support Donald Trump — account for 76 percent of the new voters. [FiveThirtyEight]

40 trillion kilometers
Good news everyone: Scientists found a new planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our solar system at 40 trillion kilometers away. Sure, we will all almost definitely be dead by the time we manage to send something there, but still it’s pretty neat. [BBC]

Amount raised by the National Republican Campaign Committee in July, which is a huge drop from fundraising numbers — $9.3 million — in June. The Democratic counterpart raised $12 million in July. [The Wall Street Journal]

According to the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, that’s the value of the approximately 110,000 homes that may have flooded during the recent disaster in the area. [The Advocate]

1st
Kyrgyzstani weightlifter Izzat Artykov was the first Olympian to be stripped of a medal earned at the Rio games. Artykov, who won bronze in 69-kilogram weightlifting, tested positive for the stimulant drug strychnine. The medal now goes to Luis Javier Mosquera Lozano of Colombia. [Yahoo Sports]

2nd consecutive medal
In better news, Ashton Eaton won the Olympic decathlon Thursday night with 8,893 points, earning his second consecutive gold medal. Only two other men have won the gold twice. [The New York Times]

22 percent
Share of U.S. methane emissions that come from livestock, with a further eight percent coming from their poop. This has spurred a lot of funding into “regenerative agriculture,” which will find ways to capture or reduce that methane before it is vented. [Bloomberg]

65 percent
Donald Trump had an average unfavorable rating of 58 percent back in January. That has since risen to 65 percent. This could pose a problem for the nominee, as people typically like to vote for people they think of favorably. [FiveThirtyEight]

223,271 permits
I am endlessly fascinated by New York City’s largely improvised infrastructure system. Seriously, what’s going on a few feet underground is a serpentine, unmapped knot of steam pipes, telecommunications wiring and power-, gas-, sewer- and water-lines — and we haven’t even mentioned the subways. So a piece detailing all the individual reasons every street in the city gets ripped apart is just catnip to me. In 2015, the city gave 223,271 permits to people who wanted to get under the asphalt. [The New York Times]

$350,000
Approximate amount of money Mother Jones spent on an investigation into America’s private prisons. On Thursday, the Justice Department announced it would no longer contract with private contractors to run prisons. The aggregate financial gain of this story for Mother Jones, though, was about $5,000 in banner ads. [Mother Jones]

0.06 percent
NPR is shutting down its comments, and really you can’t blame them after checking out the actual numbers: Despite nearly 33 million users and 491,000 comments in July, all the comments were from a mere 19,400 users, or 0.06 percent of visitors to NPR.org. What’s more, the top 4,300 users posted 67 percent of the comments in the past two months. Take it to Twitter folks, or just send me a nasty email directly; it is honestly faster. [NPR]

4 pot brownies
An Omaha man ate four brownies that turned out to be pot brownies his kid left in the back of the car. According to a report in the Omaha World-Herald, the police were called after he started freaking out — understandable after Maureen Dowd-ing — and paramedics said he’d be fine. The man is on record as saying incredibly rude things to his cat before taking a nap. This is the greatest news story ever. [Omaha World-Herald]

61 percent
Percentage of people in the U.S. who agree racism against black Americans is widespread, according to a Gallup survey. [Gallup]

80 percent
Sure, all eyes are glued to the slow-motion car accident that is the U.S. presidential election, but there’s a far more consequential election going on too: Eighty percent of state legislative seats are up this cycle, and there could be profound shifts given what is going on at the top of the ticket. [FiveThirtyEight]

239 bouts
Number of amateur boxing bouts at the Rio games so far. The international association “responsible” for the sport said Wednesday that it had sent several judges and referees home after questionable decisions in Olympic matches. The move followed a Tuesday fight in which Irishman Michael Conlan lost on a decision to Russian Vladimir Nikitin despite dominating the match in the eyes of many viewers. After the fight, Conlan called out the governing body for blatant misconduct, alleging the fight had been rigged. [The New York Times]

524 square feet
One way Walmart has managed to increase profits is to cut costs when it comes to employees who walk the floor. The company has an average of one employee per 524 square feet of retail space; the amount of space per employee is up 19 percent from a decade ago. Here’s the issue though: With fewer employees to keep an eye out, there’s more crime going down in Walmart stores, and local police departments can be stretched thin. [Bloomberg]

Dick’s Sporting Goods reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday. But the retailer also owns Golf Galaxy, the canary in the coal mine of the increasingly dire golf business. Same-store sales were down 4.3 percent last quarter at the golf chain, while analysts only expected a dip of 1.5 percent. [Bloomberg]

6 points
A Public Policy Polling survey of the state of Texas found that Donald Trump leads in the state by a mere 6 points over rival Hillary Clinton. The Democrat actually leads Trump 49-45 among voters under the age of 65. [PPP]

1.0 million
Number of viewers who tuned in to Fox on Friday to watch the Yankees take on the Rays in Alex Rodriguez’s final game. It’s nice to be reminded that New York City is not America, because that is a dismal damn rating, losing to the 1.2 million people who watched the previous week’s contest, a rerun of “Masterchef.” [Sports Media Watch]

$1 million
While Playboy Enterprises sold the Playboy Mansion to a neighbor for $100 million, the deal stipulates that Hugh Hefner, a known sex-haver, gets to live in the mansion as long as he wants to. His previous rent was apparently $100 per year, but the new owner is now charging $1 million per year for the rental. Given that pornography is now often found free on the internet, and apparently has been for some time, I am worried for Hef. It sucks getting priced out of a prime apartment. [Business Insider]

$1.69 million
If you are the type of person who would like to buy a helicopter, now is the best time in a while. A pre-owned 2010 Bell 407 helicopter is 13 percent cheaper now than it was two years ago, according to a helicopter appraisal firm, which is a type of business I didn’t know existed until now. For the cool price of $1.69 million you, your mining concern or your corporation can own such a model of helicopter. [Quartz]

$135 million
Gawker Media was sold Tuesday at an auction to Univision for $135 million. The bankrupt online publisher was for sale due to a Peter Thiel-funded Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to a $140 million judgement against the company and owner Nick Denton. A judge still has to approve the deal. [Recode]

Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, has banned cars one day per month. The drive to create safer and cleaner cities is enviable, as literally Sunday night I saw somebody on 31st Avenue in Astoria run over a garbage bag full of what must have been — based on my on-the-ground-reporting — fish and chicken carcasses. So kudos to you, Kigali. [Quartz]

Pennsylvania’s attorney general was convicted of nine charges related to her leaking grand jury information about a political rival and then lying about it. [The New York Times]

15 detainees
The U.S. transferred 15 Guantánamo Bay detainees to the United Arab Emirates on Monday, leaving only 61 people detained at the facility. Closing Guantánamo — the herpes of U.S. foreign policy — was a campaign promise of then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008. [The Guardian]

62 percent
According to a USA TODAY/Rock the Vote survey, 62 percent of Americans ages 18 to 35 say that transgender people should be allowed to use the public bathroom of the gender with which they identify, an issue that somehow became a big deal shortly after the passage of same-sex marriage for no reason whatsoever.

Based on a coding system developed by whatever ISIS’s equivalent of human resources is, 70 percent of recruits in 2013 to 2014 had at most a basic knowledge of Islam. According to a trove of more than 3,000 leaked documents, only 5 percent of recruits indicated they had an advanced knowledge of the world’s largest religion before signing on to the group.

Simone Biles won her third medal of the Olympic Games Sunday with the individual vault event, a U.S. record for the most medals won in women’s gymnastics. Oh, all three of Biles’s medals are gold. [NPR]

101 yards
The long-awaited — well, by someone, I’m sure? — return of the Rams to Los Angeles got off to an inauspicious start Sunday when Dallas’s Lucky Whitehead returned the opening kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown. It was the Rams’ first (preseason) game in L.A. in more than two decades. [@NFL]

193 people
The personal cell phone numbers of 193 current and former members of Congress, all Democrats, were posted online by the hacker(s?) going by “Guccifer 2.0.” So if you’ve been sexting a congressman, I have some bad news. [The Wall Street Journal]

When the U.S. won its 23rd gold medal of the 2016 Olympic Games, American athletes also hit a major milestone: 1,000 cumulative gold medals for the nation since the founding of the modern games in 1896. [The Washington Post]

$2.2 million
Why, let’s do the math real quick here: Through the end of June, the joint fundraising account between the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump’s campaign had given $2.2 million to the presidential nominee’s bid and $10.1 million to the RNC. Does this lend credibility to hints that the RNC will call the presidential race a loss and focus on congressional races and the Senate if things look really bad come October? Who can say.

Simone Biles, the national hero, has won Olympic gold with a score of 62.198 in the individual all-around artistic gymnastics event. Her teammate Aly Raisman got silver. Biles is the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in the event. [ABC News]

67 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit
All right, so make a mental list of places where you would like to exercise. For me, this list is empty. But for you, it might contain any number of scenic locations. Right now, Olympic marathon runners will have to contend with, among other things, running 26.2 miles in proximity to the equator. I think we can all agree that this notion sucks, and science agrees too. The temperature for the women’s marathon Sunday in Rio de Janeiro is forecast to be 67 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:30 a.m. The reality is that the marathon would be far better — by which I mean faster, because faster is always better — if it were in the Winter Games.

What’s the home-field advantage for a Summer Olympic Games host? Pretty significant, it turns out. Compared with the team’s performance in the Summer Games four years before, on average the overall medal count was 20.1 higher, with 10.9 more golds, for the nation hosting the games. But when you exclude the years where the games were affected by Soviet Union or U.S. boycotts — man, the ’80s were weird, what were you people thinking? — the average jump shrinks to 12.2 medals for the home team with 6.8 additional golds.

Trump is also not doing very well among voters aged 18 to 29. When asked who they would vote for in an election held today, 41 percent backed Hillary Clinton, according to that Marist survey. Another 23 percent said they would support Libertarian Gary Johnson, and 16 percent said they would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

Michael Barrett, the director of Missouri’s public defender system, says he has a big funding problem. In an unusual letter to the governor, Jay Nixon, Barrett said the state’s public defender system is ranked 49th in the U.S., that its budget has been repeatedly cut, and that he can’t hire enough attorneys for the department to do its job under the current funding level. Luckily, section 600.042.5 of state law allows him to essentially pick any member of the Missouri bar to defend a case if the need arises. So, he’s assigned a case to a prominent Missouri attorney, Gov. Jay Nixon, to prove his point. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

5 years old
Age of a kid who got his head stuck in a panel at the Hall of Advanced Mammals at the American Museum of Natural History. If that wasn’t the core plot point of “Night at the Museum” it will surely be the core plot point of “Night at the Museum 4: Ben Stiller Wants To Buy A Damn Island So We Made Another One.” [AM New York]

Number of mannequins stolen in Belleville, Ontario from different storefronts since May, which is all kinds of messed up.

Number of years worth of tax returns Donald Trump will release, according to an announcement from his campaign chief Paul Manafort. This is highly unusual, as presidential nominees and their vice presidents typically make several recent tax returns available. [The Hill]

22 percentage points
It’s looking like Donald Trump is pushing Catholics into the Democratic party. Catholics who attend mass weekly — a group that slightly supported Mitt Romney in June 2012 — have shifted 22 points leftward in June 2016, and now support Hillary Clinton in greater numbers than even Catholics who attend mass less than weekly. [FiveThirtyEight]

35 years
John Hinckley Jr. — who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan — has spent the past 35 years in a mental institution. He’s made substantial progress since: He spends 17 days per month with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, and has convalesced to the point that a federal judge has granted him his freedom. He’ll be allowed to remain free provided he follows several restrictions, including no travel to areas where the president or members of congress will be. [NPR]

FiveThirtyEight’s election model doesn’t mess around with internal polling, but here’s something interesting out of Utah: Two weeks ago an internal poll for Republican Rep.

Pokemon Go is a hit on mobile, prompting investors to send Nintendo’s stock up and up and up. The problem? Nintendo reminded investors Friday that it only owns 32 percent of the Pokemon Company, which made the app with Niantic Labs, thus sending Nintendo’s stock down as far as 17 percent at one point Monday. [The Verge]

46 percent
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are closer than ever in our forecast. That’s because of some combination of a Republican National Convention bounce for Trump, the last few weeks of bad news for Hillary Clinton, and Trump’s overall positive trend since the end of the primaries. According to the polls-only forecast, there’s a 46 percent chance Trump becomes president. Based on the now-cast, he has a 54 percent chance of winning if the election were held today.

0.7; 24; 50,000
Huge weekend in politics! Given that you read our website, you’ve likely heard that there’s a convention happening. But here’s a quick catch up to get everyone on the same page: Sen. Tim Kaine was tapped to be Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential nominee, and the pick adds about 0.7 points to Clinton’s probability of winning the election based on historical performance of Veep nominees in their home states and Virginia’s overall importance to the board. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has resigned less than 24 hours before the start of the convention after emails were leaked that showed the DNC working against Sanders during the Democratic primary. And finally, FiveThirtyEight is in Philadelphia along with an estimated 50,000 protestors a day, so things looks like they could get weird. [FiveThirtyEight, CNN, The Morning Call]

10 cents
Deposit amount in the state of Michigan for a recyclable can. When you return a can in Michigan to get recycled, you get 10 cents back. This is not the case in many other states, where the deposit is 5 cents. A Michigan man allegedly attempted to exploit this arbitrage opportunity by hauling upwards of 10,000 cans across the border to deposit for profit. The problem: Trying to mass import cans for redemption is illegal. He could face up to five years in prison, though legal experts are unsure if just being caught transporting the cans (rather than depositing them) is enough for a conviction. [The Guardian]

Did you know that there is still at least one company making VCRs? It would appear that that company — Funai Electric — noticed that they were still somehow making 750,000 VCRs per year and will stop doing that by the end of the month. At the format’s peak, Funai was cranking out 15 million units per year. It’s only a matter of time before a VCR maintenance, repair and resale shop opens up in Brooklyn, isn’t it? [ABC News]

+18 points
A pervasive theme of the Republican National Convention has been that the world is in a state of disarray. Still, based on several metrics averaged across a number of polls in the FiveThirtyEight database, Americans trust Clinton more than Trump on foreign policy by an average 24-point margin, during an international crisis by an average 18-point margin, and on immigration by an average 9-point margin. They do trust Trump on terrorism more than Clinton, but by an average 3-point margin, and on the economy and jobs by a 7-point margin. [FiveThirtyEight]

750 cars
Up to 750 New York City subway cars could include open passageways connecting the cars by 2020, which is an awful, awful idea. Here’s the skinny for those unfamiliar with the New York City subway system. Right now, there’s no easy way (beyond opening doors you sometimes can but are not supposed to open) to travel between cars. This is considered an antiquated system in modern transit design. But in New York, there is a very, very good reason to not give up on this system, and that’s a little something I call stench containment. See, sometimes someone will do something horrible  in a subway car. The subways run 24/7. This happens irregularly, but consistently. It will smell like someone pooped everywhere and then died and exploded everywhere, et cetera and literally ad nauseum. In the current arrangement, this situation will ruin at most one car. In the new one, you have ruined a train. This is a bad idea. [The New York Times]

1st row
Front-row seating at the Republican National Convention has been given to a very weird and occasionally blue group of states: Alabama, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, California and Pennsylvania. At the same time, the host state, Ohio, was nowhere near the front, and two GOP stalwarts, Texas and Utah, were so far back they may as well be in Akron. It’s all part of a strange calculation that seems to have something to do with Trump’s primary margin in the state. [FiveThirtyEight]

501(c)(6)
Speed bump for the Democratic National Convention’s Philadelphia host committee: for unknown reasons the IRS declined the DNC’s application for 501(c)(3) status, which would have made it a not-for-profit charity. That designation would have the lovely effect of allowing donors to the charity to get a deduction on their taxes. The RNC’s convention committee is a 501(c)(3), so donors do get a tax write-off. The DNC planners are appealing the IRS’s decision, but have considered becoming a 501(c)(6) group, technically a trade association, if they can’t get their way. [The Center for Public Integrity]

About 476 billion yen, or $4.5 billion, worth of Nintendo stock was traded. I presume the stock will evolve into a Golem, Machamp, Gengar or Alakazam. [Polygon]

7 points
Usually, it’s Republican candidates who gain an edge when a poll shifts from registered voters to likely voters. That’s not the case this time around: An ABC News poll found that while Clinton had a 4-point edge over Trump among registered voters, that edge expanded to 7 points when refining to likely voters.

$235,941
It’s looking like Tom Brady will indeed be suspended for four games next season after losing his appeals against the NFL in court, but he did make a smart financial move in April to minimize the impact: Brady restructured his contract to categorize most of the money he makes this year as a signing bonus rather than salary, meaning the losses from missing four game checks amount to $235,941 rather than $2.11 million.

$52.1 million
Taser International signed deals to provide police departments with body cameras worth $52.1 million in the first three months of this year, nine times the company’s sales in the equivalent period of 2014. [FiveThirtyEight]

3.6 out of 10
The new “Ghostbusters” hits theaters this weekend, and despite — or because of — all of the controversy around it, it has managed to become a perfect articulation of a fundamental issue with online ratings systems. Men on IMDb rate the movie 3.6 out of 10, while women have it at 7.7 out of ten. It’s up to you to decide whether or not every one of those 12,000 ratings come from someone who’s seen the movie, which went into wide release Thursday night. [FiveThirtyEight]

-6 points
Mike Pence is reportedly Donald Trump’s vice presidential choice. Still, the Indiana governor is rather unknown to voters — only 23 percent of voters have an opinion of him, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, and that opinion is more negative (15 percent) than positive (9 percent). Trump has moved his VP announcement — originally intended for 11 a.m. today — to sometime in the future because of the terrorist attack in Nice, France. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,871
The number of accidental gun deaths recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1981. By 2014, the number of accidental gun deaths had fallen by more than half. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 answered phones
The Huffington Post wanted to figure out the depth of Donald Trump’s ground game, so they called up the Trump campaign contact number in each of the 50 states. Someone picked up the phone in a mere six states. Fifteen states — including New York — have listed numbers that go to Trump campaign headquarters in New York City. This is not how this usually works: Clinton reportedly has 100 offices in 14 states, and staff in 45. [The Huffington Post]

After Theresa May’s last remaining opponent dropped out of the race to succeed David Cameron, May is set to be the U.K.’s next prime minister. Cameron will resign Wednesday and will have to personally tell the queen he’s leaving and who his successor will be, in possibly the greatest and most galling democratic tradition. May has served for the past six years as Cameron’s Home Secretary. [ABC News]

19 seasons
Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs has retired after 19 seasons in the NBA. He’ll go down as one of the greatest ever despite his soft-spoken demeanor. [FiveThirtyEight]

17,000 square feet
New documents indicate a 17,000-square-foot LED screen will be built in Times Square, because we must bathe New York in constant daylight at all hours one block at a time. Still, it will be smaller than the largest sign in the world, a screen at 7 Times Square, which is currently under construction. [New York YIMBY]

$10 million
Former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh has started a campaign for the Indiana Senate seat up for grabs in November. He has at least 10 million reasons to do so, as his old campaign account still remains flush. He puts the Indiana seat — contested on the right by Rep. Todd Young — very much in play. [CNN]

$4 billion
UFC, the mixed martial arts league, has been sold to talent agency WME-IMG as well as several other parties for a reported $4 billion. Talk about return on investment: The MMA organization was originally purchased for $2 million in 2000. [The Washington Post]

$9 billion
The numbers are still very much in flux, but the release of the hit alternate reality gaming app Pokemon Go has sent the value of Nintendo skyrocketing. The game added $7.5 billion to the value of the company in the two days since the game’s release, and $9 billion total after Monday trading. [CNBC, The Atlantic, Wall Street Journal]

1-0
Portugal defeated France 1-0 in the championship game of the Euro 2016 soccer tournament in the Stade de France Sunday. This win was accompanied by an unrelenting assault on the stadium by an army of moths, which I presume was either from a low-rent Icelandic or Welsh super-villain, or someone who forgot to turn the world’s largest porch light off. [The Guardian, Quartz]

2 years
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Friday that it will ban Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes from performing blood tests for two years, and that it will revoke Theranos’s license for the company’s lab in California, indicating that the safety of patients is in jeopardy. The company — which voided some test results from 2014 and 2015 — has returned inaccurate blood tests. There’s still time to appeal, but the decision is a hugely consequential one for the once-$9 billion start up. [Wall Street Journal]

22 majors
Serena Williams won her 22nd major title at Wimbledon Saturday, tying the record set by Steffi Graf for majors won in the Open-era. Nine of those wins came after Williams turned 30, putting her into an elite class. [FiveThirtyEight]

Rule 40
Are you ready for some RNC intrigue? I totally am. A group of delegates to the Republican National Committee do not want Trump to be the standard bearer of its party. This group is probably going to fail. So what’s next? Mild irritation to the nominee. A delegate faction is pushing a change to Rule 40 of the convention rules to give them a stronger route to reject the nominee’s preferred veep, making it easier to get alternate candidates in the mix. [Buzzfeed]

1985
A 29-year-old bullfighter was gored Saturday on live television, leading to his death. He’s the first professional to die in a Spanish bullfight since 1985. [Time]

$5,400
In the 2012 presidential election, board members of the Republican Jewish Coalition donated at least $16.5 million to the campaign and supporting super PAC of nominee Mitt Romney. Donald Trump — who fired off a tweet last week that has been called anti-semitic — has raised merely $5,400 from board members through May. It’s just one niche of the GOP that Trump has struggled to win over, contributing to his overall fundraising shortfall. [Wall Street Journal]

12 officers shot, 5 killed
At least one gunman shot 12 police officers, killing five, in Dallas on Thursday night. Two civilians were also wounded. The attack occurred during a demonstration against recent police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. This story is still developing, so there’s still a lot we don’t know. [Dallas Morning News]

$2
Cost of a typical roadside drug test kit used by police departments. Namely, is that white powder you’re packing baking soda or blow? Well, it turns out that these cheap drug tests have some pretty significant problems with false positives. One study found 33 percent of cocaine field tests in Las Vegas between 2010 and 2013 were false positives. According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, 21 percent of substances identified by the police as methamphetamine were not methamphetamine. [ProPublica]

12 percent
Nielsen is out with a report on how the music industry did in the first six months of 2016. The company tracked 208.9 billion music streams, including audio and video, which is up 58.7 percent over the same period in 2015. Still, the remnants of a bygone era of music aren’t going away quietly: Sales of vinyl LPs accounted for 12 percent of “physical business” in the first six months of 2016, up from 9 percent last year. [Nielsen]

14 percent
Percent of people who trust the news information they get from friends, families and acquaintances “a lot,” compared to 18 percent who place a similar level of trust in national news organizations. Nobody trusts what they read on Facebook, though: Only 4 percent of web users trusted news from social media “a lot.” [Pew Research Center]

41 GOP senators
Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, went to Capitol Hill yesterday. More than 200 Republican House members showed up to a meeting with Trump, but a separate meeting with the nominal GOP standard-bearer was attended by just 41 of the 54 Republican senators. Only 30 senators entered the meeting through the front door, where the media’s cameras were rolling. While we don’t know exactly what went down in these meetings, early reports include a number of hilarious altercations between Trump and the “Establishment.” [Politico]

74 percent
Percentage of registered voters who said that “it really matters who wins the election,” according to a Pew Research Center study. That’s the largest percentage Pew has found in any presidential election cycle going back to 2000, when only half of respondents agreed. The study also found that a higher percentage of people think about the election and follow news about the election than in any presidential year since 1992. [Pew Research Center]

UPDATE (July 8, 5:48 p.m.): This article has been updated to reflect new information about the Dallas attack, including a new casualty count from the Dallas mayor, Mike Rawlings, who said Friday that seven law enforcement officers were wounded, along with two civilians, in addition to the five officers who were killed..

6.2 percent
Global growth in same-store sales at McDonald’s in the first quarter, a win that has led the company to — buckle up, people — expand all-day breakfast options even more. As a person who has very little self-control/self-respect and a profound love of breakfast burritos, this is incredible news for me. [Bloomberg]

21 months
A Spanish court sentenced soccer star Lionel Messi to 21 months in prison for tax fraud. Neither he nor his father, who received a similar sentence, is expected to spend any time behind bars; as the BBC put it, “under the Spanish system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.” [BBC]

26 percent
Of about 350 major companies and institutions, Google was the largest consumer of renewable electricity, accounting for 26 percent of long-term renewable electricity contracts, according to a Bloomberg study of corporate power-purchase agreements. The Pentagon is No. 2 on the list, reflecting a commitment by the U.S. military to gradually go green. The tech industry alone bought 1.78 gigawatts of renewable power in 2015, which seems like more than enough to toss a DeLorean back to the Reagan era. [Bloomberg]

81 percent
Mondelez International, a global food conglomerate, is trying to buy the Hershey Company. But Hershey is a weird company: 81 percent of the chocolatier’s voting shares are controlled by the Hershey Trust Company, which funds charitable ventures. And the attorney general in Pennsylvania — where Hershey has an absurdly big economic footprint — also gets to approve or veto any transaction. So, to score the acquisition, Mondelez has to persuade the Hershey board, the Hershey foundation and a politician, which is one reason that Hershey has managed to go stag to the prom of food industry consolidation for so long. [The New York Times, TheStreet]

8,400 troops
There are about 10,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan right now. President Obama planned, as recently as 2014, to have only 1,000 members of the U.S. military there when he left office. In late 2015, he revised that up to 5,500. He announced on Wednesday, though, that about 8,400 troops will remain in Afghanistan through the end of his presidency. For some context, the U.S. has been in Afghanistan since I was 11 years old. I have a 401(k) now. [FiveThirtyEight, The Atlantic]

2.6 million words
A U.K. report released Wednesday looking into the nation’s involvement in the Iraq War found that the military invasion was not a “last resort” and that there was not a coherent reconstruction plan before the invasion. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement after the release of the report — which came in at roughly 2.6 million words — taking full responsibility for mistakes made by the U.K. [Quartz]

Vashti Cunningham will help represent the U.S. in the high jump at the Rio Olympics. At just 18 years old, she’s the youngest U.S. track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics since 1980. [Excelle Sports]

50 years
The Freedom of Information Act has turned 50. President Lyndon Johnson signed the open-records law, allowing anyone to request federal government documents with a mere letter. [The Washington Post]

110 emails in 52 chains
James Comey, the director of the FBI, released details on Tuesday of his department’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The FBI found 110 messages in 52 email chains that contained classified information, but no criminal charges were recommended. [Digg]

300 pounds
A 61-year-old Canadian man, Rick Nelson, survived an attack by a 300-pound mother black bear after coming across the bear’s cub while walking his dog. Nelson punched the mama bear in the face (twice). “Most bears are right-handed,” Nelson, a former bear hunter, said. I’m really just going to trust him on this one. [CBC]

31 million routers
Close your eyes and think of a wireless router. You are probably thinking of the Linksys WRT54GL router. You know, the blue one with two antennae that came out in 2005. Shockingly, this antiquated bit of George W. Bush-era tech is still a good seller for Linksys, pulling in multi-million dollar sales each year. They’re cheap, they stack, and they’re apparently durable. The WRT54G line of routers has sold 31 million units in the past 14 years. [Ars Technica]

264 billion barrels
Estimated recoverable oil reserves in the U.S., more than half of which is locked up in shale oil, according to Rystad Energy. That’s a higher figure than Russia or Saudi Arabia. [Bloomberg]

28 months
That’s how long the House select committee’s investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attacks lasted, exceeding the amount of time high-profile congressional committees spent digging into Watergate, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Sept. 11 attacks and Pearl Harbor. [AJC]

37 orbits
NASA’s Juno probe traveled through our solar system for nearly five years and arrived Monday at its destination: Jupiter. It will spend about 18 months carrying out 37 orbits to figure out the gas giant’s deal. [NBC News]

Between 64 and 116 civilians
Number of civilians that have been inadvertently killed during the U.S. drone and air war against terror suspects in “non-war zones,” according to the Obama administration. Watchdog groups place that figure higher. [The Washington Post]

70 hot dogs
Joey Chestnut won this year’s Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest after eating 70 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Last week, I looked at the evolution of that competition and how it transformed from a charming contest in which people consumed a lot of hot dogs into an event where victory is ensured only by a self-imposed 10-minute meat-and-bread waterboarding session. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

440 death sentences
Just five prosecutors are responsible for putting a huge chunk of people on death row in the U.S. over the last several decades, a Harvard Law School investigation found. These five head prosecutors (only one is still in office) put 440 people on death row. Keep in mind: There have only been 8,038 death sentences since the reinstatement of the death penalty 40 years ago. [The Guardian]

20,000 pounds of cheese
Crime of the century in Wisconsin: 20,000 pounds of cheese from U.S. Foods, en route from Green Bay to New York, was stolen. Anyone with information is encouraged to call me. [The Associated Press]

31 songs
Of the 128 songs to hit the Top 40 this year, 31 were performed by women, 22 by groups of men and women, and the rest were performed by men. [Fusion]

33 films
Of the top-50 grossing films of 2016, only 33 of them have passed the so-called Bechdel-Wallace test, which a film passes when it has two named female characters who have a conversation that is not about a man. That’s better than normal, but still a long way to go. [Fusion]

2000
That’s the year Adnan Syed, the subject of the blockbuster “Serial” podcast, was convicted for killing his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison. Maryland has granted him a retrial. [The New York Times]

$90,000
About 80,000 bottles of beer worth roughly $90,000 were stolen last week. This is bad, but it gets worse. Even though the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Southeastern Transportation Security Council recovered 30 of the 40 stolen pallets, the booze will have to be thrown away, because life is suffering.

3 films
Originally, there was going to be a single film based on the tedious 1980s video game “Tetris,” for the usual, terrible reasons a studio would make a movie based on ’80s nostalgia and geometry puzzles. For new, inexplicable reasons, that idea has now been expanded to a trilogy of films based on the intellectual property, because why the hell not. A Tetris cinematic universe is exactly what we as a society deserve. [Empire Online]

19 titles
The Marine Corps will change 19 official job titles such as “infantryman” to a gender neutral alternative, dropping the “man” part. Infantryman will be changing to “basic infantry Marine,” for instance. It does sound catchier? [The Washington Post]

The FiveThirtyEight election forecast dropped yesterday! Based on the data in our polls-only forecast, Donald Trump has a 19.3 percent chance of becoming the President of the United States. [FiveThirtyEight]

Percentage of Iceland’s television audience that watched Iceland defeat England in the UEFA EURO 2016 tournament. That makes the O.J. chase look like CSPAN. [Deadspin]

683
Number of people admitted to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the folks who vote on the Oscars.

41 killed
A terrorist attack at Turkey’s Ataturk airport has claimed at least 41 lives. Three gunmen loaded with suicide vests attacked the terminal, fired upon travelers, clashed with police, and eventually detonated their suicide bombs. Two of the gunmen detonated their bombs within the terminal and one in the parking lot. The death toll is expected to rise to as high as 50. [BBC]

230 injured
The Turkish justice minister said that 230 people were injured as well. This is far from the first act of terror this year on Turkish soil: Just this past March, 37 were killed by a car bomb in Ankara. [BBC]

11th busiest
The Ataturk Airport in Istanbul is the 11th busiest airport on the planet, with 61.8 million passengers passing through there last year. [Yahoo]

6.44 percent
Turkey’s tourism industry has seen visits from foreigners drop substantially as the region destabilizes. January 2016 tourism was down 6.44 percent year over year. [The Telegraph]

Further damage to tourism would be especially harmful, as 8 percent of Turkey’s workforce are employed directly in the tourism business. [BBC]

0
Number of attackers able to get past the first security check, in part due to the courageous actions of the police in the airport. From a design perspective — compared to the American system of a single security check leading to a massive line full of unscreened individuals — Turkey’s airports have a security check at the entrance of the buildings and a subsequent checkpoint before the departure gate.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that Texas laws requiring abortion clinics to meet the standards of “ambulatory surgical centers” and that their doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital constituted an undue burden. From 1970 through 2014, abortion and contraceptive related decisions overall tended to come out in favor of the conservative-leaning party. [FiveThirtyEight]

New Hampshire called into question its status as the “live free or die” state Friday when Gov. Maggie Hassan signed H.B. 1547, a bill finally banning sex with animals. Bestiality is still somehow legal in nine states and D.C., bringing up the question of who on earth is lobbying for it and why are they this powerful?

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Britain has voted to exit the European Union, a news event so transformational that it’s taking over Significant Digits. Your regularly-scheduled, topically-omnivorous Significant Digits resumes Monday.

51.9 percent
With 100 percent of voting areas reporting, 51.9 percent of U.K. voters have cast their ballot to leave the European Union. 17.4 million people were in favor of leaving, and 16.1 million were in favor of remaining in the EU. [The Wall Street Journal]

2 years
Now the U.K. will initiate Article 50 of the EU treaty in order to secede, which gives them two years to negotiate an exit. [Bloomberg]

$1.50
The vote has lead to a nearly instantaneous devaluing of the pound. On Thursday, at the market’s most bullish moment, one pound could buy about 1.50 American dollars. Once it became clear that the U.K. was going to leave, its value dropped swiftly. At its nadir 1 pound could buy about 1.32 dollars. That’s the lowest it’s been since at least 1985. [CNBC]

44 percent
The EU is the U.K.’s largest trading partner, and 44 percent of the country’s exports go to the EU. Because of the results of the referendum, there’s now uncertainty around what a new trade deal will look like between the two bodies, and whatever the result is could be bad news for the U.K.’s economy. [Bloomberg]

A few months
Who will negotiate those trade deals? Who knows, as Prime Minister David Cameron’s coming days in office are numbered. The architect and ostensible leader of the opposition to the referendum said he will resign before the end of October. [The Guardian]

32 of 32 council areas
In leaving the EU, the U.K. may ultimately break itself up. Remember 2014, when Scotland decided to stay in the U.K. during its own referendum? Well, it also wanted to stay in the EU: Every one of its council areas voted to remain in Thursday’s vote. After the vote, Scotland’s first minister said that Scotland sees its future in the EU, and that a new Scottish independence vote is “highly likely.” [Business Insider]

€1.2 billion
That’s the amount of weekly trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, trade that was facilitated by both nations’ being in the EU. Brexit was forecast to reduce the GDP of Ireland by 1.2 percent according to the Irish Minister of Finance. In the medium term, trade between the two nations could drop by 20 percent. The cabinet of Ireland will have an emergency meeting to discuss what comes next. [The Irish Times]

Based on internal Uber documents BuzzFeed obtained, that’s the effective hourly wage for an Uber driver in the Houston area. [BuzzFeed]

44 percent
Percentage of Republicans and Democrats who said they almost never agree with the positions espoused by the other party, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. The polarization is pretty grim: 55 percent of Democrats said the GOP makes them feel afraid and 57 percent of Republicans said the Democrats make them feel frustrated. [Pew Research Center]

16,000 a day
Average number of people who signed up for TSA PreCheck, a service that claims to get passengers through airport security faster than the main lines, in the month of May. That rate has been climbing steadily, and lo and behold would you believe there’s now a long line for PreCheck as a result? There’s no winning with this agency. [The New York Times]

$500,000 per episode
The “Game of Thrones” leads are negotiating with producers for their salary in the show’s final two seasons, and reports indicate Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are looking at $500,000 per episode paychecks, up from the reported $300,000 per episode they made in season six. [Vulture]

$8.2 million
Annual NSF funding to the Arecibo Observatory, the largest radio telescope on earth. Due to budget problems, the NSF may have to cut some of that funding. How does a large telescope in Puerto Rico make the cut for Significant Digits? Well for starters it’s totally that telescope from “Goldeneye,” the best Bond movie ever and the one where James Bond drops a superstructure on Sean Bean. And as the spokesman of the small, yet vocal fan community surrounding Alan Cumming’s widely beloved performance as Boris Grishenko in the 1995 film, I say in one resounding voice: Save. This. Telescope. [National Geographic]

187 billion pounds
Expected weight of electronic waste that will be produced globally this year. Grinding up those circuit boards and extracting the valuable elements in them is a fluctuating business, but a necessary one given that just dumping non-renewable metals into a dump isn’t sustainable. [The Verge]

0
The number of deaths at EDC Las Vegas — that’s the Electric Daisy Carnival, a music festival that has some notoriety for being a place of extensive pharmaceutical consumption without the approval of a physician, if you catch my drift. It’s the first time since 2013 that nobody died at EDC. On Sunday there were 212 medical calls and 40 felony narcotics arrests. But a great year, all things considered. [Los Angeles Times]

59.6 percent
Percentage of tweets from Donald Trump between Nov. 5 and June 2 that contained one exclamation point. About 10.4 percent contain two or more exclamation points. He appears to be enjoying himself during the run for the White House. About 7 percent of Hillary Clinton’s tweets from Nov. 15 to June 8 had at least one exclamation point. Sad! [FiveThirtyEight]

71 percent
A new SurveyMonkey poll of Britons found a very narrow lead — 49 percent to 48 percent — for the “Leave” campaign in Britain’s referendum on whether to be part of the European Union. One crucial angle here: the youth of Britain want to stay in the E.U.: 71 percent of 18-24 year olds said they plan to vote “remain.” [Business Insider]

$2.86 billion
Speaking of a man who moved money from one part of his life to another, Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has offered to buy a different company Musk is a major shareholder in, SolarCity Corp., for $2.86 billion. The move would cost Musk quite a bit of money personally but in the end would consolidate his holdings and bail out SolarCity, which has been struggling. [Bloomberg]

A bouncy house at a child’s birthday party was swept up by high winds and blown into power lines in Niagara, New York, this past Saturday. Since it had no occupants at the time, this went from “horrifying catastrophe” to “hilarious must-see video” nearly immediately. [ABC News]

3rd place
This year’s Golden State Warriors had a serious chance at being the best-ever NBA team, but their loss in the NBA Finals means they’re not even in the top two. The 2015-16 Warriors, with a blended Elo score of 1798 on the season, finished behind the 1995-96 and 1996-97 Chicago Bulls. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 bot makers
Twitch, a video streaming service that is a subsidiary of Amazon, has filed a lawsuit against seven bot makers, claiming that they are responsible for inflating view counts and subscriber numbers on the website. Twitch is pretty much throwing the whole book at them, claiming “federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, fraud, breach of contract, and tortious interference,” according to Quartz. Dang. [Quartz]

44 percent
British voters will vote on a referendum to exit the European Union on June 23, and based on the latest polling it’s going to be very tight. An Opinium poll has “leave” and “remain” camps tied with 44 percent each, and two YouGov polls put the support for each side within a point or two of each other. [ABC News]

10.8 percent
The U.S. gross domestic product grew 10.8 percent between the first quarter of 2008 — its pre-recession peak — and the fourth quarter of 2015. For comparison, the GDP of the Eurozone’s only grew 0.6 percent, and Japan’s grew 0.1 percent. [The Wall Street Journal]

30 paid staff
Estimated paid staff the Trump campaign said it had on the ground across the country. Judging by previous campaigns, that is an … atypical number of staffers to have at this point. [The Associated Press]

96 percent
That’s the percentage of films in which Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson uses violence in some way shape or form, prior to the release of “Central Intelligence” this past weekend. The lone exception in his career was “The Game Plan,” a fluffy PG-rated Disney movie. “Central Intelligence” had a good opening weekend, finishing behind “Finding Dory” but still hauling in $34.5 million. [FiveThirtyEight, Box Office Mojo]

93-89
In case you live too far from Cleveland to have heard an entire city shouting into the night, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors 93-89 last night in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. It is Cleveland’s first major sports championship in 52 years. [ESPN]

$38,000 a day
Secret service protection for a presidential candidate can cost upwards of $38,000 per day. Sen. Bernie Sanders, despite the fact that it appears he will not obtain his party’s nomination, has not yet suspended his campaign, so he still gets that protection. And that could remain the case through the convention. [The Washington Post]

$1.2 billion
Amount of money Starbucks is holding that came from funds pre-loaded onto a Starbucks card or their app as of the first quarter. [Huffington Post]

1.5 cents per ounce
Philadelphia has become the first major American city to pass a tax on soda. The tax — 1.5 cents per ounce — will be levied on distributors. While it’s a bit unclear how much more consumers will end up paying as a result of the tax, it may add about a buck to the cost of a two-liter bottle of soda. [NPR]

13 percent
Having kids makes you less happy than people who don’t have kids, according to research in a number of nations. A new paper in the American Journal of Sociology found that American parents are 13 percent less happy than American non-parents. It’s the largest gap in the set of 22 developed countries studied. “The researchers,” Quartz wrote, “looked at what impact policies such as paid sick and vacation leave and subsidized child care have on closing that gap. It was 100%.” [Quartz]

291 hedge fund liquidations
More hedge funds folded in the first quarter of this year than opened up shop: 291 funds liquidated, and 206 were formed. [Bloomberg]

$64 million
Amount the committee hosting the Republican National Convention is looking to raise. They have $50.5 million committed in cash and $7 million in free products and services, but many companies that have sponsored the GOP convention in the past have declined to participate this year. Gosh, I wonder what’s different this cycle? [Bloomberg]

The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin is looking like an increasingly good race for Democrats, and Sen. Ron Johnson looks like one of the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans up for election this year. Former Sen. Russ Feingold has the support of 51 percent of likely voters according to a new Marquette University poll. Johnson has 42 percent. [Marquette University]

New York Gov.

On June 23, Britain will vote on whether to exit the European Union, and the two camps have now taken the conflict to a new level: naval warfare on the Thames. Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party assembled a fleet of about 30 vessels with pro-Brexit banners. Later, Bob Geldof, a singer, lead his own flotilla of anti-Brexit boaters, which was sprayed with water from a hose by the pro-Brexit armada. It’s insane. [The Washington Post]

In 2014, 39 percent of doctorate recipients did not have a job or did not intend to continue their studies. That was up from 31 percent in 2009. Here’s the problem: More people are getting postgraduate degrees even as the job market for those degrees declines. [The Wall Street Journal]

3 words
Mongolia has an issue with addresses. A quarter of the country’s population is nomadic, and many of its roads don’t have names. So the government is switching to a system devised by the startup What3Words, which has assigned a three-word phrase to every nine-square-meter area on the map. This will mean that every Mongolian residence will be mapped to a phrase. For instance, the U.S. embassy currently at “Denver Street #3, 11th Micro-District, Ulaanbaatar 14190” will instead be reachable at “constants.stuffy.activism.” Memorable, yeah? [Quartz]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Today we’re focused on the mass shooting that took place at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning. If this feels familiar, it should.

49 victims
A gunman armed with an assault rifle entered a gay nightclub in Orlando at 2 a.m. Sunday and killed at least 49 people over a three-hour siege. Thirty-nine victims were pronounced dead at the nightclub, called Pulse, and 11 were taken to hospitals where they were pronounced dead. The killer is also dead. It is the largest act of terror on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. [CNN]

53 injuries
At least 53 people were wounded in the attack, many of whom are still fighting for their lives. Orlando Regional Medical Center — which has a level 1 trauma center — admitted 44 patients, as many victims had severe gunshot wounds (nine victims were also pronounced dead at that hospital). By mid-afternoon Sunday, doctors had operated on 26 people. [The Orlando Sentinel]

3 FBI interviews
The killer in the Orlando mass shooting, Omar Mateen, was placed on the terrorist watch list after being the subject of two FBI investigations, one in 2013 regarding comments he made that appeared sympathetic to terrorists and one in 2014 after he had made contact with an American who went on to become a suicide bomber in Syria. The FBI interviewed him three times throughout that process. He was subsequently removed from the watch list. [The Los Angeles Times, The Hill]

8.3 times the victimization rate
The shooter is reported to have canvassed at least one other gay club in the Orlando area before settling on Pulse. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate crime statistics across many different demographics, and while its most recent data is from a 2011 analysis, the Center reported that the basic pattern holds year to year. From 1995 to 2008, there were 15,351 anti-LGBT hate crime offenses against people (that excludes crimes against property). The LGBT community makes up an estimated 2.1 percent of the population, yet accounts for 17.4 percent of the total reported violent hate crimes (and many hate crimes are never reported). LGBT Americans, therefore, were victims of hate crimes at about 8.3 times the expected rate. For perspective on that, it’s more than double the rates of Jewish and black Americans, more than quadruple the rate of Muslim Americans, and more than 41 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. [The Southern Poverty Law Center, The East Orlando Post]

85 percent
Between 2002 and 2014, 85 percent of people killed by terrorists in the U.S. were killed using guns. [FiveThirtyEight]

14 shootings
In the past 10 years, assault-style weapons have been used in 14 public mass shootings, according to The Washington Post. That includes the Orlando killings, the San Bernardino, California, attack and Umpqua Community College shooting in 2015 and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater and Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in 2012. Of those 14 shootings, seven have occurred in the past 12 months. The 1994 ban on assault weapons expired in 2004, 12 years ago. [The Boston Globe, Michael Skolnik]

$1.2 million
The community response to the tragedy in Orlando has been overwhelming. Central Florida blood banks were at capacity and urged people to return later in the week. A GoFundMe to support the victims has already passed $1.36 million. And a LaunchGood from the Muslim community orchestrated by CAIR Florida has already raised more than $37,000. [The Orlando Sentinel, GoFundMe, LaunchGood]

UPDATE (June 13, 11 a.m.): This article has been updated to reflect a new casualty count from law enforcement officials, who said Monday that Mateen killed 49 people. The 50th fatality was Mateen, who was killed by police.

$10 each
Several states may have legalized marijuana, but we don’t have a good way to figure out if someone is high — a concern for drivers. Right now, the system is laborious, but researchers are working on faster methods of ascertaining the presence of THC in someone’s blood, such as a breathalyzer for weed. In one experiment, 14 Washington State University students got high and took a breath test that sought to detect marijuana levels. They were compensated $10 per breath exam, which as I understand it is essentially the American dream made real. [Bloomberg]

Tinder is kicking everyone younger than 18 off its platform, answering the important question, “Jesus Christ, they seriously let kids on that thing?” Those ages 13 to 17 make up about 3 percent of Tinder’s active users, the company said. [Quartz]

33 percent
Percentage of respondents to a Gallup poll who said they would vote for a woman for president if she was qualified in every other respect. In 1937! Don’t freak out! Man, that is really the sort of thing I should have put at the beginning of the sentence. Things are a lot different now. [FiveThirtyEight]

46 signatures
Jerry Seinfeld recently indicated that he believes the world is clamoring for a sequel to his 2007 film “Bee Movie.” This is a delightful fiction. The AV Club went out to find this supposed “groundswell of support” and located a Facebook group with 27 members and a Change.org petition with 46 signatures imploring Hollywood to take the plunge and make a “Bee Movie” sequel. (Those numbers have increased with the AV Club’s coverage.)
But just think of the potential for a “Bee Movie” cinematic universe — not to mention all the unanswered questions put forward in “Bee Movie” and the hints embedded in the film designed to send all those die-hard “Bee Movie” book fans for a loop. I imagine Seinfeld can only hold out a short while longer before acting on the urge to get “Bee Movie 2” in the works. [AV Club]

206,528 spots
Combined number of television campaign ads aired by Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders so far this year, of which Kantar Media’s campaign media analysis group classified zero as negative. Going into the general election, it’s rather dubious that trend will continue. [Bloomberg]

The PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast for digital advertising revenues next year, largely buoyed by video ads on mobile phones.

27 percent approval
Gov. Chris Christie has brutal approval numbers in his home state of New Jersey, which votes today in the presidential primaries. A Monmouth University poll reported a mere 27 percent of New Jerseyans approve of the job Christie is doing as governor. Furthermore, 80 percent said Christie cares more about his own political future than being governor. [Business Insider]

90 percent
Approximate percentage of U.S. companies that give annual raises on a fixed date each year, compared to 5 percent who give raises on the anniversary of an employee’s hire. General Electric — a longtime trendsetter in management — is reconsidering annual compensation increases. [Bloomberg]

53,575 miles
The Golden State Warriors, who are currently leading in the NBA Finals series over the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the most grueling regular season travel schedule in the NBA: 53,575 scheduled miles over the 2015-16 season. That has something to do with California being further away from most of the league — similarly remote teams including Portland, Minnesota and San Antonio follow Golden State on the list. But, interestingly enough, the team with the fewest aggregate miles traveled was Cleveland, with 35,055. [Quartz]

78,000 voters
Current California Green Party registration, down from 111,000 in early 2015. A spokesman credited the roughly 30 percent drop to the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has targeted members of the rather-left-leaning-indeed party to support him as Democrats in California’s (somewhat) closed Democratic primary, which is today. [Mother Jones]

A year into Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption drive, his administration is reporting the recovery of $9.1 billion diverted from the government to former public officials or into private accounts.

9.4 points
Average simple error — that is, the difference between how a poll said the top two candidates in a primary performed and how they actually did — in the 2016 presidential primaries so far. The polls were a little worse than their average — 8.1 points — over the past five presidential cycles. Typically, though, primaries are a lot more difficult to nail than general elections. [FiveThirtyEight]

33 cities
The Guardian called up 81 cities east of the Mississippi to ask about their water supply. As it turns out, 33 of them have lead testing procedures that don’t conform to the EPA’s guidance, including pre-flushing water from pipes before testing it, running the water slowly, and removing aerators from faucets, all of which can make the lead reading lower. [The Guardian]

45.5 percent
Percentage of U.S. adults who worked for an employer at least 30 hours per week in May, the best rate for a month of May since the metric was developed by Gallup in 2010. [Gallup]

3,617 patents
Number of U.S. patents awarded to IBM though June 2, making it the largest awardee of patents in the technology space so far. It’s followed by Samsung, with 3,032, and Google, with 1,530. IBM averages 23.6 per day. [Quartz]

150 million
Reported number of daily users of Snapchat, the ephemeral photo-sharing and messaging app. This means that the newcomer has eclipsed Twitter in daily users, which analysts peg as having less than 140 million daily users. [Bloomberg]

$38.5 billion
Size of the payday loan market in the United States. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking to step in to regulate that high-interest sector of the lending industry. The requirements will include forcing lenders to look into a borrower’s capacity to pay the loan back, which you’d figure was standard, but nope, it is definitely part of the issue here.

3,400 milligrams
Approximate average daily sodium intake for Americans. The FDA wants that to get to around 2,300 milligrams, and issued voluntary guidelines yesterday urging food producers — like restaurants and manufacturers — to gradually decrease the sodium content in their food over time. The gist is that because salt tastes great, none of the individual producers have an incentive to reduce it alone, lest their food taste worse than their competitors. So the FDA wants everybody to gradually drop the salt. [The Wall Street Journal]

In the third quarter of Game 6 between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors’ probability of winning the best-of-seven series was about 4.2 percent. Two subsequent victories make it the seventh-largest comeback in a best-of-seven series since 1984. [FiveThirtyEight]

15 feet long
A 15-foot long gator was spotted at Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto, Florida. This new data forced me to reconsider my mental ranking of sports, so I suppose golf is now the fourth-most dangerous game after Jumanji, Full-Contact Clue and hunting human beings for sport. [ESPN]

$287,858.44
Selling ice cream out of trucks in New York City is apparently a violent and disturbing business, as laid out in a frankly absurd article describing the difficulties facing the Mister Softee company due to a new competitor. And while Dimitrios Tsirkos of New York Ice Cream was ordered by a court to pay Mister Softee $287,858.44 in legal fees, and more than $767,000 overall, the real battle for ice cream is on the streets. “Every truck has a bat inside,” is a serious line from an article about ice cream trucks. [The New York Times]

1.2 million people
According to Amnesty International, that’s how many Afghans have left their homes following strife between the government and the Taliban. Many of those who have fled are moving from the country to the major cities, which is putting financial strain on some localities. [The Washington Post]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. This is Blythe Terrell subbing for Walt Hickey, who is off somewhere nailing “Shout.”

3 years old
The age of a boy who entered a gorilla enclosure Sunday at the Cincinnati Zoo. The zoo killed a 17-year-old gorilla, called Harambe, that was near the child. A lot of people are upset about the decision to kill the gorilla, but everyone is being super understanding about the parenting decisions involved. [CNN]

6-0
My St. Louis Cardinals came out on top over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday. Just wanted to get that out there in advance of what’s sure to be an NL Central bloodbath this season. May be time to update this guy. [ABC]

30 minutes
That’s how long a Thai man spent trying to remove a python from his penis after it latched on while he was using a squat toilet in his home near Bangkok last week. It’s good to know this kind of thing happens in real life and not just in Samuel L. Jackson’s magnum opus and also EVERYONE’S NIGHTMARES. [The Associated Press]

36 points
Steph Curry had 36 points in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals Monday night. His Golden State Warriors took out Oklahoma City, 96-88, to earn a rematch with Cleveland in the NBA Finals. But I think what we’re all most excited about is seeing more of this kiddo. [ESPN]

59 percent
Bookings at Trump Hotels over the past three months are down 59 percent year over year, which is fine because I’m pretty sure you’d make that up in a hot second Airbnb-ing the Lincoln Bedroom. [Priceonomics]

62 percent
The percentage of adults who get news on social media, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last week. So you should probably tweet that snake penis thing above, because, dammit, the people need to know. [Pew]

5-kilometer radius
The search for the lost EgyptAir Flight 804 will be narrowed to a 5-kilometer radius after Airbus, the manufacturer of the downed plane, detected signals in the Mediterranean Sea from the plane’s emergency locator transmitter. [CNN]

11th team
America has an Indoor Football League, which is news to me. The league is making a Utah team expansion, its 11th team, and the ownership of the forthcoming franchise is heavily involving fans in decision making. First up: the name. Which team from Utah will join the likes of the Iowa Barnstormers, the Tri-Cities Fever and the Billings Wolves? The top two contenders in a fan vote are the “Stormin’ Mormons” and “Teamy McTeamface.” Shockingly, the ownership is cool with this. [St. Louis Tribune]

61.2 percent
We are rapidly coming up on the conclusion of the Democratic presidential primary, and California and New Jersey are set to vote on June 7. Right now FiveThirtyEight’s forecast has Clinton getting 61.2 percent of the vote in California. [FiveThirtyEight]

72
That’s the number of metal bands per million people in the United States, according to an analysis of Encyclopaedia Metallum, a database of metal bands. Finland has 630 bands per million, Sweden has 428, and Norway has 299, just blowing us out of the water. #MakeAmericaMetalAgain. [Jakub Marian]

1,239 delegates
By the Associated Press’ reckoning — after talking to several unbound delegates who indicated they will now support Trump at the convention — Donald Trump has formally won the GOP nomination, eclipsing the 1,237 delegate majority needed to win. [The Associated Press]

70,000 missed flights
An executive from American Airlines said that TSA security screening delays led to 70,000 customers missing their American Airlines flights so far this year. [Reuters]

9 bedrooms
The Obama family will rent a nine-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot home in Washington, D.C., after the president leaves the White House and at least until Sasha completes high school. The house is in a tony neighborhood two miles from his current home. [The New York Times]

11 states
Officials from Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin are suing the Obama administration over its directive that requires schools to allow transgender students in public schools to use the restroom of their choosing. [Reuters]

30 percent
Percentage of Lego kits that include weapons according to research from New Zealand’s University of Canterbury. In fairness, a Lego brick on a hardwood floor against a barefoot opponent is the deadliest weapon known to man, and all of the sets are capable of that. [BBC]

94 startup founders
Bloomberg analyzed 890 U.S. startups that raised at least $20 million in venture capital and were founded in 2009-2015, and there are so, so many significant digits packed inside. One to get you started: While founders’ most common undergrad alma mater was Stanford (90 of them), slightly more, 94, dropped out or didn’t attend college at all. [Bloomberg]

218 NBA players
There are 447 players in the NBA, and 218 of them are related to an elite athlete (anyone who played any sport in college, professional leagues, or on a national team). Compared to random samplings of the NFL and MLB, that rate (48.8 percent) is huge. [The Wall Street Journal]

75.3 million visits
The number of visits to the 58 U.S. national parks that reported visitor numbers last year, the highest level ever. Gas is cheap, the weather is nice, and people are responding to promotional campaigns the National Park Service is putting out. In related news, I recently paused to watch two pigeons fighting over a churro at Columbus Circle, because I too am trying to broaden my horizons when it comes to exposing myself to the natural world around us.

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

10 percent
The TSA has some serious issues going into the heavy summer travel months, with lines building and passengers getting steamed. One source of the problem: Since 2013 the airport security agency’s employee base has dropped by 10 percent while travel is up 12 percent over the same period. [The Takeaway]

12 percent
Venezuela is suffering through a food shortage, and a study last month found that 12 percent of polled Venezuelans reported they were having fewer than three meals per day. [The Guardian]

25 percent
A U.K. study looking at the effect the end of a marriage has on diet found that men who divorced, separated, or were widowed cut their consumption of fruits and vegetables by 25 percent compared to men who stayed married. [The Wall Street Journal]

32.1 percent
According to the Pew Research Center, 32.1 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 live in their parents’ home, which is higher than the 31.6 percent in that age group who live with a spouse or are cohabiting. It’s the first time in more than a century that more young Americans live with their parents than a partner. [NPR]

$300 million
Volkswagen has invested $300 million into Israeli taxi-ordering app Gett. The investment is reminiscent of General Motor’s $500 million investment in Lyft, another ride hailing app. [Bloomberg]

$139 billion
The E.U. has given the go-ahead for Anheuser-Busch InBev to acquire SABMiller, a competitor, provided AB InBev sells off most of SABMiller’s beer business on the continent. Europeans spend about $139 billion on beer every year, so regulators are worried the consolidation could lead to a price hike. [Reuters]

14th-worst defeat
The NBA’s Western Conference finals have been turned upside down by Sunday’s Golden State Warriors loss to the Oklahoma Thunder in Game 3 of the series. The 28-point loss was the 14th-worst ever for a top-seeded team in the playoffs, judging by point margin. That the Warriors were supposed to be a historically-great top seed made it even more shocking. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 counties
Half of the growth in new business creation during the economic recovery has happened in a mere 20 counties in the U.S., according to a study from Economic Innovation Group, a research and advocacy group founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sean Parker. [The Washington Post]

55.3 percent
According to a 2014 study, that’s the percentage of psychiatrists who take private insurance, compared to the 88.7 percent average for all health care professionals. The reasons for this are complex, but the gist is that since so many in the field work solo, and insurance companies haven’t upped the compensation rate in years, it can make more sense to ask patients to pay cash a lot of the time. [Quartz]

$80.17
In addition to a one-game suspension, Dahntay Jones of the Cleveland Cavaliers owes a fine of $80.17 for punching Toronto Raptors center Bismack Biyombo in the groin during Game 3. Teammate LeBron James, presumably after ruffling through his couch cushions for a few lost twenties, said he will cover the fine. [ESPN, h/t @JoeyCasavecchia]

89.9 percent
Percentage of Spotify revenues derived from paid subscriptions in 2015, with the rest coming from users playing ads on the free advertisement-supported tier. This means that the vast majority of Spotify’s $2.18 billion in 2015 revenue came from the 31 percent of its users who were paid subscribers. [Quartz]

13,317,980 visitors
Number of visitors this past 2015-16 season to Broadway, up 1.6 percent over the previous season. Also, another fun digit in the data: 478,605. That is the precise number of people I now know I envy, because they have seen “Hamilton” on Broadway and I have not. [The New York Times]

2 shows
Maroon 5 canceled two shows in North Carolina — one in Charlotte and another in Raleigh — over a new state law forcing transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their birth gender. [CNN]

About 10 minutes
The White House went into lockdown Sunday for about 10 minutes over what turned out to be misplaced party balloons. [Bloomberg]

19 states
Some think that Donald Trump’s polls are undercounting his support, since voters may be hesitant to tell a stranger they support Trump. But the evidence doesn’t suggest that’s the case. Donald Trump has underperformed his polling forecast in 19 states so far in the Republican primary, compared to 15 states where he overperformed his polling. The median state saw Trump underperform his polls by 1.1 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

157 women
Number of pregnant women in the United States who have tested positive for the Zika virus as of the end of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A further 122 pregnant women in U.S. territories have tested positive. [Reuters]

$39 million
“The Angry Birds Movie” took in $39 million domestically in its first weekend in theaters. That means that, yes, “The Angry Birds Movie” somehow became the top grossing film at the box office for at least one weekend in America. On balance, I think we deserve this election. [USA Today]

$504 billion
Total cash and non-cash equivalent holdings of Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Alphabet (the parent company of Google), combined. U.S. non-financial companies have $1.7 trillion in cash, meaning that five companies control 30 percent of the dough. [USA Today]

2 identical testimonies
Two expert witnesses submitted identical testimony to a House subcommittee hearing on an Obama administration proposal aimed at reducing prescription drug costs. The two witnesses belong to separate interest groups that both oppose the administration’s proposal but that happen to be represented by the same a lobbying firm. [The Huffington Post]

8 a.m.
Listen, we try to avoid New York naval-gazing here in Significant Digits, but this story is just so personally consequential that I can’t leave it out. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed legislation that would allow alcohol to be sold in bars and restaurants before noon on Sundays. The current setup really cramps my brunch game. The proposal would permit restaurants to start serving liquor at 8 a.m. That would be a huge win: Once Sunday matches the rest of the week, there will be only four hours each day, from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m., that I cannot be holed up in a bar. [New York Daily News]

52.9 percent
Probability that a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals will be able to redeem a Papa John’s pizza discount after any given game (all it takes is a Cardinals win). That’s thanks to the close promotional relationship Major League Baseball has formed with Papa John’s. Still, Atlanta Braves fans aren’t so lucky; they follow a team with a mere 7.7 percent chance of getting six runs in a game, the trigger for the Papa John’s discount there. The New York Yankees are using the same promotion as Atlanta, but a Yankees fan has a 14.4 percent chance to win the discount each game — of course, presumably they have enough self-respect as New Yorkers not to eat Papa John’s pizza. [FiveThirtyEight]

75 stores
The Gap will close roughly 75 Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, mainly retail shops overseas. Sales fell 6 percent in the first quarter compared to last year. [The Washington Post]

107 hours
That’s how long Portugal ran its electricity system with renewable energy — solar, wind and hydroelectric, exclusively— last week. That’s more than four days. [The Guardian]

511 million pre-cut apples
Want your kids to eat more apples? Just cut them up. A new study found that the share of kids who ate at least half an apple as part of their school lunch was “70 percent higher at schools that served sliced apples.” Americans generally — not just school kids — consumed 511 million pre-cut apples in 2014, a new high.

11 potential Supreme Court picks
Donald Trump released a list of 11 judges that he would consider to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. All 11 are white, and eight are men, but Trump’s potential nominees are unconventional for the Supreme Court in other ways — none went to Harvard Law School, for instance. [FiveThirtyEight]

16 percent
Falling oil prices have caused a massive downturn in North Dakota, which had been riding an energy boom. The downturn has affected virtually every corner of life and economic activity in the state. An exotic dancer, for example, told Reuters that her tips are down 60 percent since last year. Live births at St. Alexius Medical Center are projected to dip. Industrial real estate prices are cratering. And the syphilis transmission rate fell 16 percent in 2015 from its peak the year before. [Reuters]

57.9 percent
Percentage of voters in Clinton County, Kentucky, that supported Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. This is not an important county in the overall battle for the Democratic nomination; it doesn’t tell us anything about national voting trends. But the victory is a moral one for Clinton: Bernie Sanders had won all eight of the other counties named Clinton to vote so far, in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. [The Hill]

70 percent
That’s the average percentage of IMDb user ratings on television programs with 1,000 or more votes that are from men, san imbalance that has led to a significant skew in how shows favored by women and shows favored by men are rated overall by users. Namely, male reviewers on IMDb hate on television aimed at women. [FiveThirtyEight]

4.2 million workers
The Obama administration announced new rules on Wednesday that doubled the salary threshold, from $23,660 to $47,476, under which workers are guaranteed overtime pay. An additional 4.2 million workers will benefit from the change, according to an estimate from the Department of Labor. [The Washington Post]

1 superdelegate
Bernie Sanders, who trails Hillary Clinton in pledged delegates and superdelegates, is trying to woo Clinton’s superdelegates to switch sides. He faced a setback, though, when one of his superdelegates — Emmett Hansen II of the U.S. Virgin Islands — announced that he will now back Clinton. [Bloomberg]

3 pounds of cheese
There’s a surplus of cheese in the United States. High prices and a hot export market sent production soaring, but then a strengthening dollar put off foreign buyers and prices sank. At current cheese levels, Americans would need to increase their consumption this year by 3 pounds each to eat the surplus away. This is the best news I have ever heard in my entire life, and I plan to do my part. [The Wall Street Journal]

More than 8 metric tons of cocaine
That’s the amount of cocaine seized by Colombian authorities last weekend at a banana farm. That’s more than 17,500 pounds, or roughly the weight of … you know what, I’m not going to even compare it to some really heavy thing; all you have to know is that it is a crapload of cocaine. [CNN]

30 percent
According to a University of Michigan Medical School survey of high-achieving doctors, that’s the percentage of women who said they have been sexually harassed during their careers. [Newsweek]

62 years
That’s how long it’s been since the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, declared segregated schools unconstitutional. But just this week, a judge ordered the Cleveland school district in Mississippi to desegregate. A plaintiff in the case — now 57 years old — was in fourth grade when the case was brought in 1965. [NPR]

335-to-1
Based on a new report from the AFL-CIO federation of unions, the average CEO of a company on the S&P 500 made 335 times as much money as the average production and non-supervisory worker in 2015. That’s down from 373 times as much money as 2014. Hooray? [Reuters]

The world’s oldest person, Susannah Mushatt Jones, died Thursday at 116. Now, Earth has only one known human inhabitant born in the 1800s, Emma Morano of Italy. Morano was “born about a month before 1900 began.” [USA Today]

$2
Cost of a bottomless soda at the Atlanta Falcons’ Mercedes-Benz Stadium when it opens next year, just one part of a new concessions menu that will be the cheapest of any major sports team. Atlanta has evidently been struggling to sell tickets to its new stadium, so a 12-ounce Bud Light for $5 may be one solution. [ESPN]

More than 650 counties
At least 650 U.S. counties will likely have only one insurer available on the Obamacare exchanges in 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, up from 225 in 2016. About 70 percent of those counties are primarily rural. [The Wall Street Journal]

253,000 comics
Number of issues of Black Panther #1, newly relaunched with acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, sold so far this year, making it the best-selling comic book issue of 2016 so far. [Comichron]

More than $350 million
According to the Government Accountability Office, Department of Defense space launches from the United Launch Alliance (ULA) — a collaboration between Boeing and Lockheed Martin — cost more than $350 million each, compared with the less than $100 million per launch cost SpaceX has promised. Politico reported: “Even the Pentagon’s acquisition chief grants that the creation of ULA — a monopoly criticized by the Federal Trade Commission when it was formed at the government’s behest a decade ago — may have been a mistake.” [POLITICO]

$888 million
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested big in Apple in the first quarter of this year, scooping up more than 9.8 million shares. That investment was worth roughly $1.1 billion, but it’s worth only about $888 million now because of declines in Apple’s share price. [CNN Money]

Last year, Milan, Italy, set the world record for longest pizza at just over 1.5 kilometers, and Naples is hella mad. Chefs in Naples have prepped to make a 2 kilometer pizza containing some two tons of mozzarella (for U.S. residents unfamiliar with the metric system, a kilometer is basically a mile that phoned it in). [NPR]

7-6
That was the score of a baseball game played on Sunday between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays. (The Rangers won.) But that scoreline barely scratches the surface of what went down. There were ejections galore, the best punch I’ve ever seen televised and a bench-clearing brawl. You know, basically a boring hockey game. [ESPN]

18.9 percent
Percentage of Americans aged 65 and older who are working, the highest level in decades. [Bloomberg]

More than 4,000 complaints
Las Vegas was hit hard by the Great Recession and the collapse of the housing market. To this day, it is contending with the consequences, including squatters. In 2015, there were more than 4,000 complaints to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department about squatters, up 43 percent compared to 2014. [The New York Times]

50 or more employees
The lower house of the French parliament passed a bill that would make it illegal for companies with 50 or more employees to send emails outside of work hours — namely, after work and on the weekend. [The Washington Post]

38,000 slots
The gaokao is China’s college entrance exam. It is basically the SAT on steroids, the kind of thing kids spend their lives preparing for. So the announcement that 38,000 slots at universities in the wealthy Jiangsu province will be saved for applicants from other, often poorer areas did not go over well. There were demonstrations in multiple cities. “In the provincial capital, Nanjing,” The Wall Street Journal wrote, “parents gathered outside of provincial offices Saturday, shouting, ‘Governor, come out!’ as riot police kept them at bay.” [The Wall Street Journal]

It appears that psychologists are just as susceptible to psychological tricks as the rest of us: After the Center for Open Science announced that it would award badges to scientific papers that used transparent methods and shared their data, the percentage of such papers appearing in the journal Psychological Science jumped tenfold to nearly 40 percent of papers published. You get a gold star, Center for Open Science. [FiveThirtyEight]

9-5
Vladimir Putin played a pickup game of hockey against some amateurs and basically wiped the ice with them: His team — which, sure, may have had a few former players on it — won 9-5. (What I would give to hear Putin’s attempts at chirping.) The big story of the game, though, is that Putin totally ate it at one point and a photographer got a picture of his fall into The Guardian. [The Guardian]

24 speeches
With 22 commencements addresses in the bank and two more to come this year at Rutgers University and the Air Force Academy, that’s the total number of graduation speeches President Obama will have given while in office. Obama’s rate of three speeches per year is about par for presidents since the speech-heavy years of George H.W. Bush, who gave 23 commencement addresses in just four years as president! [FiveThirtyEight]

518 votes
Number of votes obtained by the presidential ticket of the Prohibition Party in the 2012 election, down from 270,000 votes in the halcyon days of 1892. This year, the party hopes to get on the ballot in six states, up from just one state in 2012. [The Guardian]

The Kepler mission to find new worlds has found another batch of planets, NASA announced Tuesday. This time it’s 1,284 new planets, bringing the total found by the Kepler space telescope to 2,325. Uh, maybe Clinton’s got a point with that whole alien thing. [NASA]

Conservative estimate for the number of mercenaries working around the globe who are from Uganda. The nation is a major source of private security personnel, whose employment ranges from guarding banks and malls at home to protecting American diplomats in Iraq. [Bloomberg]

The top 25 hedge fund managers pulled in a collective $13 billion last year, with Kenneth Griffin of Citadel and James Simons of Renaissance Technologies receiving the highest individual compensation. [Reuters]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

63 percent
West Virginia votes in its presidential primary today, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is the 63 percent favorite to win on the Democratic side, according to our polls-plus forecast. On the Republican side, who really cares? That ship has sailed. [FiveThirtyEight]

90 percent
Percentage of Alaska general fund revenue that comes from oil. With oil vastly cheaper now than it was several years ago, the state is facing a substantial fiscal problem. [Bloomberg]

717 Republicans
Number of people who have filed to run for Congress and recorded donations on the GOP side this cycle, compared to 577 Democrats. This isn’t vastly out of line with previous cycles, suggesting that whatever is happening at the top of the ticket, we aren’t seeing a Trump-like assault from party outsiders in down-ballot races. [FiveThirtyEight]

$62.8 million
Cost of a high school football stadium in McKinney, Texas, that the school board just approved. There will be 12,000 seats, which seems patently absurd to this life-long East Coaster. [Sports Illustrated]

$1.35 billion
Krispy Kreme has been acquired by JAB Holding for $1.35 billion, presumably glazed. The holding company also owns Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, so it seems like it has the coffee-and-doughnut market pretty much cornered. [CNN]

6 worst weeks
With the rise in availability of cheap natural gas, U.S. coal production has taken a massive hit. One stat really drives home how bad it has gotten: The six worst weeks for coal production (excluding holiday weeks) have all happened this year! [Inside Energy]

42 years old
Bartolo Colon, a professional baseball player for the New York Mets, hit his first-ever home run, at the age of 42, this past weekend. [ESPN]

56 percent
Residents of Austin, Texas, voted 56 percent against a proposal put forward by the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft seeking to skirt laws requiring fingerprint background checks for drivers, among other regulations. The vote is a legal setback for the companies, and like many hipsters before them, they’re threatening to leave Austin. [USA Today]

80 percent
Percentage of polled Americans who said the Islamic State was their top international concern. [Bloomberg]

687 percent
Canada is just lousy with syphilis right now — which is a sentence I never realized I desperately wanted to write — and is facing a shortage of drugs to confront the problem. The number of annual syphilis cases nationally jumped to 3,266 in 2013 from 475 in 1998, a 687 percent jump over 15 years. [Global News]

More than 325,000 podcasts
The number of podcasts available through Apple’s podcast services. That’s a real credit to the boom in podcasting in recent years, but there are some problems. The popularity of podcasting poses a headache for Apple, which has not signaled an abundant interest in maintaining the community, and podcasters appear to be rudderless when it comes to navigating interactions with the company. [The New York Times]
CORRECTION (9 a.m., May 9): An earlier version of this article misstated the role of pitchers in the National League. They bat regularly in National League stadiums; they do not bat only during inter-league games.

5 cents
The New York City Council voted Thursday to implement a 5 cent fee on carryout bags with a few exceptions. I can only imagine this is exceptional news for local NPR affiliate WNYC, which can finally get more of those fly tote bags into the wild now. [The New York Times]

12 hours
That’s the big sell of OxyContin, or at least it was: pain relief for 12 hours. But despite the claim, the lack of consistent results for many patients led to over-prescribing or increased doses, which in turn has in part led to an opiate epidemic that has claimed 190,000 lives since 1999. [Los Angeles Times]

18 years old
The Food and Drug Administration has banned the sale of electronic cigarettes to people under the age of 18, marking the first major federal regulatory actions on the product. The person who seems to walk ahead of me on my commute every morning was unavailable for comment. [The Washington Post]

20 films
Number of films Hollywood will release in 2016 that contain a colon in their title. “Captain America: Civil War” is 5 percent of that, for those counting at home. [The Wrap]

58
President Obama announced that he will commute the sentences of 58 federal inmates incarcerated for drug crimes. [The Hill]

81 percent
Based on a series of thousands of crowdsourced matchups, some quick modeling and a whole bunch of simulations, I estimate that Team Iron Man would defeat Team Cap about 81 percent of the time based on the assorted strength ratings of each squad. This is largely due to Captain America’s mediocre recruitment, as he would only lose to Iron Man about 60 percent of the time in one-on-one matchups. Applying sports analytics to comic book characters is not where I expected my career to go, but I’m cool with this. [FiveThirtyEight]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

1 state
John Kasich suspended his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination on Wednesday, ceding victory to Donald Trump. Kasich managed the impressive feat of remaining in the race longer than any other losing contender while somehow winning only a single state (Ohio) and accumulating a mere 154 delegates — a figure that was lower than the delegate count for Marco Rubio, who halted his campaign in the middle of March. [CNBC]

25 grams per week
Tea consumption per week per capita in the U.K. in 2014, down from 68 grams in 1974. Tea appears to be the victim of a generational divide, as the former staple of the British diet is not as popular among younger folks. [The Washington Post]

26 years old
The NHL’s Arizona Coyotes will name John Chayka the team’s GM today, making the 26-year-old stathead the youngest GM in the league. Is this the stats-in-sports bubble bursting? Who can say. [USA Today]

1857
That’s the last time a big earthquake seriously rocked the southern portion of the San Andreas fault line, and seismologists are worried about built-up stress on the fault line busting out in a destructive way. [The Los Angeles Times]

66,602
Number of passenger elevators in New York City. At any given time, based on the upwards of 76,000 total elevators and the average weight restriction, about 18 percent of the city’s population could potentially be held up by the five boroughs’ elevators if we ever elected to give that a whirl. [FiveThirtyEight]

$240,000
An economics professor has estimated that resellers of tickets to “Hamilton” — the hottest show on Broadway — make $240,000 per week in aggregate. “Hamilton” speculation is a brisk business in the city. [Bloomberg]

1 sanctioned athlete
Not even the rough-and-tumble world of competitive tug of war has escaped doping scandals: The World Anti-Doping Association has processed 107 drug tests for the sport, one of which led to a sanction. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 years
Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly speaker, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in a corruption case. He’ll also face a $1.75 million fine and will forfeit $5.3 million in ill-gotten gains. Somehow, six of the last seven New York state legislative majority leaders have been convicted on criminal charges. [ABC New York]

16 nominations
“Hamilton,” that awesome play none of us will ever get tickets to but still play on Spotify nonstop, has been nominated for a record 16 Tony Awards. Also, we kept ol’ Hambone on the $10 bill, so he’s doing pretty OK right now. [Vulture]

32
Number of people kidnapped by pirates this year so far compared to 15 in all of last year. With ransoms up to $400,000, it’s brisk business for hijackers, according to the Oceans Beyond Piracy group. [BBC]

53%
With 53 percent of the vote statewide, Donald Trump has won the Indiana Republican primary and, barring a major shift in the forthcoming states, has become the presumptive nominee of the GOP. Also, Sen. Ted Cruz has dropped out. Wow. [ABC News]

New York City is sending Puerto Rico 1 million NYC-branded condoms to combat the spread of the Zika virus. [New York Magazine]

0
The NSA and FBI sent 1,457 electronic surveillance order requests to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2015. Of those, zero were denied. The secret court did modify 80 of them, up from 19 in 2014, so we have that going for us. [Reuters]

1st place
Leicester City F.C. — which I’ve come to understand is essentially the Chicago Cubs of Premier League soccer, yet somehow worse? — has clinched the title! This was considered a delirious long shot by oddsmakers at the beginning of the season — some gambling houses were offering 5,000-to-1 odds on them winning the title — which means that fans are thrilled and bookies are very screwed. [Digg]

25 alarms
Do you want to be more like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson? I know how many of you read our stories about his obscene cod-focused diet, so I know the answer is “god, absolutely, get on with it, Walt, how do I be more like Dwayne”The Rock” Johnson?” Well, besides being a known triple threat — actor, wrestler, flexer — it turns out Johnson is a mobile application entrepreneur and has announced The Rock Clock, an alarm clock app that has 25 hand-crafted ringtones from the creator imploring you to wake up. It is free, because we do not deserve Dwayne Johnson. It is on my phone, because I am the worst at waking up. [The Verge]

83 percent
The Indiana primary is today, and it’s in many ways the beginning of the end — one way or the other — of the #NeverTrump campaign. A clean win for Cruz in the state is a win for the anti-Trump forces within the GOP, and a win for Donald J. Trump is a massive setback and potential death knell for the forces opposing the real estate magnate. According to our polls-plus forecast based on nine polls, Trump has an 83 percent chance of winning the statewide vote. [FiveThirtyEight]

97.6 percent
Federal criminal cases rarely go to court these days — last year 97.6 percent of defendants in federal criminal cases simply pleaded guilty, and there were 40 percent fewer trials than in 2009. That may explain the fight-em-in-the-papers prosecutorial style of Preet Bharara — the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who has gone to war with Wall Street and New York state officials — as he has fewer opportunities to make noise in the courtroom. [The New Yorker]

170 pounds
Since his retirement, American Pharoah has gained 170 pounds and gotten hella laid. He is a horse and a Triple Crown winner, so it is not that weird. American Pharaoh’s racing success — which is a sport that has the interesting economic side effect of making normally worthless horse spermatozoa a wildly expensive commodity among rich people with weird hobbies — means that his owners get $200,000 every time a mare he mates with produces a foal that can stand. Capitalism is weird. [CNBC]
Correction: An earlier version of the last item in this article misspelled the name of the horse that won the Triple Crown. It is American Pharoah, not American Pharaoh.

4.4 percent increase
Jump in U.S. and Canadian sales at Burger King in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company credits that increase in part due to the addition of hot dogs to its menu. (BK makes a pretty crummy hot dog if you ask me, and this is coming from a person who is evaluating hot dogs in terms of relative quality.) [Miami Herald]

No. 253
Cornerback Kalan Reed was selected as the 253rd and final pick of the 2016 NFL draft, earning the future Tennessee Titan the dubious title of “Mr. Irrelevant.” Still, he’s among good company: Ryan Succop of the Titans was also Mr. Irrelevant, but has gone on to have a solid kicking career since he was drafted in 2009. [Yahoo Sports]

2017
Malia Obama has decided on what she’s doing for college: She will take a gap year, then enter Harvard University as a freshman in the Fall of 2017. [Reuters]

$17,570
The University of New Hampshire is trotting out the “mistakes were made” response to outrage over a $17,570 dining hall table. The custom table — outfitted with LED lights that would help staff demonstrate healthy cooking techniques — seats only 16, making it technically more expensive than a $1,000 per plate fundraiser. I don’t think I own a single thing worth more than $17,570. The Associated Press says $17,570 is “nearly as much” as tuition for in-state students at UNH. [WPDE]

$4.26 million
Amount spent by Facebook last year on security for CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuck is the world’s eighth richest person, and the company spent $12.5 million from 2013 through 2015 keeping him secure. [Bloomberg]

$26 million
Sen. Chuck Schumer, the heir apparent on the Democratic side of the Senate to succeed leader Harry Reid, is a fundraising juggernaut. Despite having an easy race this coming election, Schumer’s raised more than $26 million, money that can be transferred to party committees later in the cycle should the need arise.

No. 1 pick
With the number one pick in the NFL draft … the Los Angeles Rams selected Cal quarterback Jared Goff. But enough about that, let’s get to the real story of the night: A photo was shared on Laremy Tunsil’s Twitter account that appeared to show Tunsil smoking out of a gas-mask bong. This likely led to Tunsil, a highly touted offensive lineman, dropping to the 13th pick. [Sports Illustrated]

1 minute, 13 seconds
If you’re on the West Coast and missed NPR’s “Morning Edition” for a bit Thursday morning, the culprit has been found: A child visiting NPR headquarters as part of one of those bring-your-child-to-work days accidentally pressed enough buttons in a control room to take NPR off the air for 1 minute, 13 seconds in some areas. [Gawker]

6/17/2006
From June 17, 2006, to June 17, 2007, HBO had its best run of television in the network’s history, based on IMDb user ratings of aired episodes. As it stands, HBO is doing rather well at the moment, but with the eventual end of “Game of Thrones” on the horizon, the cable network is in desperate need of another big hit. [FiveThirtyEight]

93.2 out of 100 on the America scale
Suck it, John Mellencamp: If you wanted to pinpoint “normal America” on a map, it turns out the metropolitan area most similar to the United States is not somewhere in flyover country and not somewhere that has farms or horses or a Tastee Freez or stuff like that. It is, in fact, New Haven, Connecticut. That’s right, an analysis of the areas most resembling the U.S. as a whole found that the metropolitan areas most resembling the country were those around New Haven, Tampa and Hartford. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.6 billion
Companies that specialize in subscription-based commerce — namely getting your credit card number and charging you monthly for a good or service you may or may not use — have garnered about $1.6 billion in venture capitalist money since 2011. Many of these services, though, can be really bad for consumers, signing them on to a subscription without their knowledge. [Bloomberg]

$3.8 billion
Comcast plans to buy DreamWorks Animation SKG for $3.8 billion. Comcast is hoping the purchase will help it diversify its holdings and take on Disney, whose portfolio includes Pixar, Marvel and, yes, FiveThirtyEight. [Reuters]

7 years
Real-estate heir Robert Durst, who last year was the subject of HBO’s “The Jinx” documentary series, was sentenced Thursday to seven years in prison for a federal gun crime in Louisiana. He’ll likely serve his time in California, where he is charged with murdering his friend, Susan Berman. [Reuters]

40 people
Harvard is in the middle of a mumps outbreak, with 40 people sickened by the virus over the past two months. If the infection continues to spread, it could affect commencement. [CNN]

96 football players
Number of college underclassmen who opted to enter the NFL draft this year, passing up additional years of development in exchange for a potential NFL career with a big — well, since we don’t pay college athletes, let’s call it “any” — payday. That’s the second-highest number ever. [The New York Times]

120 people
A massive raid in the Bronx Wednesday led to the the arrests of 120 alleged gang members. The arrests targeted two rival gangs, Big Money Bosses and 2Fly YGz. It’s believed to be the largest gang-related arrest ever made in New York. [CBS New York]

30,000
The House of Representatives has passed the National Bison Legacy Act, which makes the bison our first national mammal. Not that we’ve always treated it well: the bison was once nearly extinct, leaving 30,000 wild bison left in the American West. There are another 400,000 in the country being raised as livestock. [The Guardian]

$46 billion
Apple’s quarterly report Tuesday detailed a decline in year-over-year revenue — the first time that’s happened in 13 years — which led to a large drop in the price of the company’s stock. The market for Apple’s existing product line is not growing like it once did, and its new products like the Apple Watch haven’t set the world aflame. The stock dropped as much as 8 percent Wednesday, which temporarily wiped out $46 billion from its market capitalization, before finishing the day 6.2 percent down. [CNBC]

10 Kennedy interruptions
Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered the likely swing vote on a case about extreme partisan gerrymandering, asked 5 questions and made 5 statements to the Wisconsin attorneys and 0 of either to Democrats who want the partisan maps struck down. This is considered a good sign for the Democrats, as justices are statistically more likely to take the side of a petitioner they don’t pepper with questions. [FiveThirtyEight]

34 unicorns
That’s the number of new billion-dollar-valued startups (or “unicorns”) in China since mid-2015, compared to 39 in the U.S. over the same period. China is catching up to Silicon Valley when it comes to churning out expensive and jacked-up companies that are worth lots of money on paper. [Quartz]

54-point gap
Guns are about the most divisive issue in America. A Pew Research Center poll found 22 percent of Democrats chose protecting gun ownership rights over limiting access to guns, compared to 76 percent of Republicans. That staggering 54-point gap makes abortion look like an issue with a minor divide, same-sex marriage look like a mild discussion point and marijuana legalization look essentially unanimous. [FiveThirtyEight]

78 earthquakes
Number of earthquakes caused by a seismic swarm in Yellowstone National Park in September, down from 894 in August, 425 in July and 1,028 in June. Earthquake swarms are nothing to be hugely worried about — and part of me thinks this may just be viral marketing for that “Geostorm” movie coming out this fall — but now all that’s left to do is wait for scientists to analyze the data left behind. [Gizmodo]

20,093 shots
That’s the score obtained by Adam Rolston on a golf hole that’s a 2,011-kilometer, 82-day trek across Mongolia. I want to believe par is 20,092 shots and he’ll have to take the bogey. [The Guardian]

70,000 ng/kg
Measured level of dioxin in areas near the 14-acre San Jacinto Waste Pits in Texas following Hurricane Harvey. Generally, 30 ng/kg is enough for the EPA to recommend a cleanup. The hurricane appears to have spread toxic sludge. [Houston Press]

CORRECTION (Oct. 6, 11:05 a.m.): An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a poll question. Respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of Trump’s comments calling on NFL owners to fire the players and on fans to boycott games, not just his comments urging a boycott.

Given the catastrophic news from the Las Vegas strip, we’re going to hone in on that today. 
Check out the full 2016 FiveThirtyEight investigation “Gun Deaths in America” here. 

527 injured
At least 59 people are dead and 527 people injured, some critically, by the high-powered gunfire that indiscriminately targeted a crowd of country music fans Sunday night from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. [ABC News]

90 shots in 10 seconds
According to a New York Times analysis of the videos, that’s the shot frequency observed in Las Vegas, which can be compared to the 24 shots in 9 seconds observed in the Orlando attack on a gay night club, where 49 people were killed and 53 were wounded in 2016, and to the 98 shots in 7 seconds that a fully automatic rifle can provide. [The New York Times]

273
Based on the definition that a mass shooting involves four or more people shot, the shooting in Las Vegas is the 273rd of the year. Only 275 days have gone by in 2017 so far. [Fortune]

42 guns
That’s the number of guns owned by the killer found either in the hotel room or at his home. There were 23 in the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino and 19 in his home in Mesquite, NV. In addition, a number of loaded high-capacity magazines were found in his hotel room. Some of the weapons are believed capable of penetrating police armor. The haul included a number of AR-15-style firearms. [ABC News]

64 years old
Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock was 64 years old when he went on his rampage Sunday before killing himself, according to authorities. That makes him among the oldest perpetrator of an attack like this since the mid-sixties. [The Washington Post]

At least 50 dead
More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded by a gunman who opened fire on thousands of concert-goers on the Las Vegas strip on Sunday night. The massacre is already being referred to as the most deadly mass shooting in recent American history, and the death toll is only expected to rise. [NPR]

8 minutes
O.J. Simpson is once again a free man. He was released at 12:08 a.m. Sunday from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, eight minutes after he became eligible for parole. O.J. Simpson was incarcerated for nine years following a botched robbery in Las Vegas. [The Los Angeles Times]

25.6 percent
Despite only accounting for 16 percent of the population, Catalonia — a region of Spain seeking independence — produced 20.1 percent of Spanish GDP in 2015 and 25.6 percent of exports in 2016. The Spanish government cracked down on an attempt to hold a referendum regarding secession. [POLITICO]

45 kilograms
Four men were indicted Friday in New Jersey after their arrest in June for possessing 45 kilograms of fentanyl, the highly potent drug believed to be driving much of the increase in opiate fatalities. For perspective, 45 kilograms of fentanyl is enough for 18 million lethal doses. [NJ.com]

74 percent
Percentage of New York City subway commuters late to work because of problems riding the rails this past summer, according to a survey referenced in a report from city Comptroller Scott Stringer. The report claims that the negative economic impact from the troubled system has been as much as $400 million. [Gothamist]

More than 8.9 million children
The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which funds low-cost heath insurance for more than 8.9 million children whose family incomes come in just above Medicaid qualification, is set to expire. The uninsured rate for children fell from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 4.5 percent in 2015 under the program, and funding will run out at the end of the month. [ABC News]

Pivoting to video as a news site strategy sure seems like a great way to pivot to people not using your website at all: comScore data indicates that publishers that fired a bunch of writers this summer to fuel quixotic and nebulous video ambitions saw at least a 60 percent drop in traffic in August compared to August 2016. [Columbia Journalism Review]

112 TWTR points
Introducing Nate Silver’s “Trump Weekly Twitter Rage” point system. Step No. 1: Add one point for every insult made by the president from @realDonaldTrump, according to The Upshot, in the preceding seven days. Step No. 2: Add one point for every exclamation point contained in a Trump tweet in the preceding seven days. Step No. 3: That’s it, actually. The index maxed out on July 29 after a GOP health care bill failed in dramatic fashion. [FiveThirtyEight]

60,000 independent workers
Ikea (the company that sells build-it-yourself furniture) is buying TaskRabbit (the company that connects users to people who can build Ikea furniture) for an undisclosed amount. TaskRabbit has raised about $50 million since its founding and has about 60,000 independent workers on the platform. Congratulations to TäskRäbbit. [Recode]

11 hospitals
Reeling from Hurricane Maria’s devastating effects, Puerto Rico is edging toward crisis. Only 11 of the U.S. territory’s 69 hospitals had fuel and power as of Tuesday. The issue prompted the rapper Pitbull to send his plane to fly chemotherapy patients to the mainland U.S. for treatment. [CNN]

12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent
The new GOP tax plan would condense the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven (the current setup) down to three. The marginal tax rates — now 10 percent up to 39.6 percent — would be 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, but Republicans have yet to detail which incomes would be taxed at which rates. [The New York Times]

538 yards
Going into Week 4 of the NFL season, rookie running back Kareem Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs has 401 rushing yards in his first three games. That’s more than 26 of the 32 teams in the league. He also has 538(!) running and receiving yards combined, more than any rookie receiver or running back since 1980. [FiveThirtyEight, NFL]

5 animals, 12 crops
Here’s something that’s only mildly unsettling: three-quarters of the food for people on Earth comes from only five animal species and 12 crops. This seems like an issue, given that we’re one major disease, famine or blight away from losing a major component of our food. [The Guardian]

13 percent
Puerto Rico is in crisis, and the Jones Act, a law that costs an estimated billions of dollars annually to Puerto Rico, is not helping. The Jones Act requires foreign vessels bringing goods to the island to either pay high taxes and tariffs to unload there, or to take a detour to the mainland before an American ship takes the goods to Puerto Rico. This ensures Puerto Rican cost of living is 13 percent higher than other urban areas in the U.S. [The New York Times]

23 players
A Boston University study published yesterday compared the brains of 23 former football players known to suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, 50 patients who did not play football but did have Alzheimer’s disease, and 18 control brains. The study found elevated levels of one protein only in the brains of ex-players with CTE. This may open the door to a CTE test that can be conducted on living patients. [The Washington Post]

Roy Moore, a former judge who was twice removed from office, has beaten Sen. Luther Strange in a runoff to win the GOP Senate primary in Alabama. This is a blow to establishment Republicans and the President, who backed Strange. [CNN, FiveThirtyEight]

Twitter has decided to go through with it and finally torpedo the thing that makes their product tolerable: The company is testing a doubling of the maximum length of a tweet. Lucky beta testers will get 280 characters, so users will have twice as many opportunities to sabotage their reputation. [The New York Times]

Target will raise its minimum wage in October to $11 per hour, and it’s planning more wage hikes over the next few years. Come the end of 2020, the minimum wage offered by the company will be $15 per hour. [Bloomberg]

12 percent
Percentage of Americans who want to decrease taxes for the wealthy. Sixteen percent of Americans want to cut taxes for corporations. The majority of Americans — according to a Wall Street Journal poll — instead want to increase the taxes paid by corporations and the wealthy. But it’s looking like the Trump administration’s tax reform plan will include a tax cut for both of those groups. [The Wall Street Journal]

An inmate in Missouri is seeking to lengthen his time behind bars: Missouri prisons will go smoke-free by April 1 due to a lawsuit filed by an asthmatic man serving a life sentence. There are 21 correctional facilities in Missouri affected by the order and about 30,000 inmates. [The Associated Press]

On Sunday, President Trump ordered restrictions on travel to the U.S. from citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Venezuela, North Korea, and Chad. The president’s ban on travelers from Sudan, Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia — all Muslim-majority nations — was set to expire Sunday. [Bloomberg]

62 signatories
Number of Roman Catholic scholars and clergy who signed a 25-page “filial correction” letter accusing the pope of spreading heresy when he published “The Joy of Love.” That document was viewed by some in the faith as reaching out to divorced and remarried Catholics. The Catholic Church has a long history of handling grievances from concerned clergy without issue, right? [The Associated Press]

$20,000 to $50,000
Lawyers are pricey, especially D.C. lawyers. As special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian electoral interference expands, more and more people who were associated with the Trump campaign are feeling the financial pinch. Just lawyering up to help prepare for congressional testimony could set someone back $20,000 to $50,000 in fees, and a grand jury subpoena for a witness could lead to legal fees in excess of $100,000. [Bloomberg]

$37,933
“Victoria and Abdul,” an opening salvo in the awards-bait movie season, made $37,933 per-screen this past weekend at the box office, a high among the post-Toronto International Film Festival releases. [The Wrap]

Aaron Hernandez, a former NFL tight end who killed himself in prison while serving a life sentence for murder, suffered a severe form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., researchers say. He died at 27 — and having not played football for several years — but nonetheless had stage 3 C.T.E (there are four stages). [ESPN]

Looks like tickets for last night’s Los Angeles Rams-San Francisco 49ers game weren’t exactly highly sought-after commodities: Resale sites had them going for as cheap as $14, or a little less expensive than two pretzels at Levi’s Stadium. Rams won, 41-39. [SF Gate]

Amount owed by North Korea in parking tickets to the city of New York, dating all the way back to the 1990s. Of course, unpaid parking tickets are just one of several downsides of hosting the United Nations, especially when the general assembly is in session. Others include: abysmal traffic, dinner reservations becoming impossible, motorcades being less cool than normal and midtown hotel lobby bathrooms no longer being a reliable emergency option for the week.

5 states
Hillary Clinton won four of the five states in contention yesterday — Rhode Island went to Sanders — and widened her lead by about 50 delegates. On the GOP side, Donald Trump had a stellar evening, winning each of the five states — Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island — and scooping up the vast majority of the delegates on the board. [FiveThirtyEight]

156 nerds
My colleagues Ben Lindbergh and Rob Arthur reckon that there are 156 people employed by Major League Baseball clubs as quantitative analysts, up from 44 in 2009 and 75 in 2012. [FiveThirtyEight]

650,000 albums
Prince does not appear to have left a will, meaning his sister and five half-siblings may be the heirs to his estate, an estate that’s likely to have revenue coming in for some time. Since his death last Thursday, at least 650,000 albums and 2.8 million tracks have been sold. [The New York Times]

10.7 million viewers
Reported viewership for Sunday’s season six premiere of “Game of Thrones,” of whom 7.94 million were viewers who watched the show live on TV. [CNN Money]

£29 million
Cost of repairs for Big Ben, which is definitely a clock in England and not a quarterback in Pittsburgh who is paying hush money over a marijuana incident, as I thought when I first glanced at the headline “Big Ben ‘bongs’ to be silenced for £29m.” The repairs will mean Ben’s iconic bell will temporarily go quiet until everything’s refurbished. [BBC]

$150 million
The amount of Islamic State cash that the U.S.-led coalition destroyed in a bomb strike on a house in Mosul, Iraq. That strike was part of a larger strategy of targeting the terrorist group’s money depots. So far an estimated $500 million to $800 million has been destroyed by air strikes. [BBC]

9 square inches of skin
Are you a company interested in weird advertising strategies? Nick Symmonds, a runner who has appeared in two Olympic games, is auctioning off nine square inches of skin for advertisers to bid on. He’ll put a temporary tattoo of your logo on his flesh at racing events this year — though he will have to cover it up during actual races because of what he calls “antiquated rules.” During a previous auction for part of his body, he got $11,100 from an advertiser. [Ebay]

72 times
Number of times Donald Trump has been personally sued in federal court since 2000. Since 2000, Bloomberg found that Trump and his companies have either sued or been sued at least 1,300 times. [Bloomberg]

172 delegates
Number of delegates up for grabs in Republican primaries in Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut tonight. Donald Trump has 95 percent of his current delegate target based on a FiveThirtyEight analysis, and his target tonight is 97 of the 172 delegates available. Ideally, he’ll want more, and he’s favored to win big in many of the states. FiveThirtyEight will be live blogging the results this evening, and if you’re looking to watch the returns live I’ll be on the ABC News live stream tonight repping the site, so by all means check that out. [FiveThirtyEight]

$324
According to a nationwide survey from Visa, that’s how much money the average household with teenagers spent last year on “promposing,” which is exactly what it sounds like. In my day, panicked proposals came during tech week for the musical, when there was a realization that prom was near, and even though you had an AP Latin exam the next morning you should ask a friend to go with you because at least the food was supposed to be good. [Bloomberg]

$3.26 million
Price sold at auction for the “Laws of Base Ball,” a series of documents written in 1856 by Daniel Lucius Adams. It’s believed that the documents represent the first time some modern rules of baseball were put to paper. [ESPN]

$4.25 million
The relatively small amount Texas spent to repave highway shoulders and widen a 6.3 mile section of State Highway 161 during rush hour. It’s early yet, but the project has been a smashing success so far, with traffic moving twice as fast as it was before. But this isn’t how it’s supposed to work — widening highways rarely improves congestion and can make it even worse. Transportation planners are trying to figure out what has gone right so far.

Webpages are getting bigger and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. If only there was some sort of way to get a stripped-down version of a website you read every day delivered right to your inbox. [Wired]

9-3-2-6-2-5
The Chicago White Sox pulled off an extended triple play Friday against the Texas Rangers. It involved the right fielder (a position represented by “9” in baseball parlance) catching the fly ball, tossing it to first (3) where a runner was tagged out, the ball going to the catcher (2), then the shortstop (6), then the catcher again (2) and finally the third baseman (5) who tagged another runner out. As the announcer said, “Bases loaded, bases cleaned.” [Deadspin]

20-point margin
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is far back in the delegate count and is running out of races where he can close that gap. As of now, he’ll have to win the remaining contests by a 20-point margin over Hillary Clinton to erase the deficit. With many delegates up for grabs on Tuesday as part of several East Coast states’ primaries, losses there could lead to a tactical shift in how the Sanders campaign talks about Clinton. [NPR]

28 pages
Amid mounting pressure, the White House is considering whether to declassify all or portions of a 28-page section of the 9/11 congressional inquiry that some think may detail a connection between Saudi Arabia and the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. [The Associated Press]

57 delegates
Number of Republican delegates at stake in Indiana. The Ted Cruz and John Kasich campaigns announced Sunday night — right after “Game of Thrones” no less — that Kasich would leave Indiana to Cruz and Cruz would let Kasich campaign unimpeded in Oregon and New Mexico, all to help stop Donald Trump. #NeverTrump has finally learned that campaigns can talk to each other, it would appear. [POLITICO]

79 percent
With Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut holding primaries tomorrow, we’ve got forecasts for the latter three states based on current polling. Donald Trump has a 79 percent chance of winning Maryland, an 89 percent chance of winning Connecticut and a 98 percent chance of winning Pennsylvania. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is a strong favorite in each of those three states. And as for Delaware and Rhode Island … have you considered inviting more people to your states to make yourselves more appealing to pollsters? [FiveThirtyEight]

1 female CEO
In 2015, 359 new chief executives were named at the top 2,500 companies globally, according to a new study by Strategy&. Of those 359 new CEO’s, 10 were women. And of the 87 new chief executives appointed in the U.S. and Canada from that group, only one — Andrea Greenberg, CEO of MSG Networks — was a woman. [The Washington Post]

The No. 2 pick
The Philadelphia Eagles, a team I despise, traded a whole bundle of draft picks to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for the No. 2 overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft and a fourth-round pick next year. The Browns got a first-, third- and fourth-round pick this year, a first-round pick in 2017, and a second-round pick in 2018. My hope, as a New York Giants fan, is that this is the first good trade in the history of the Cleveland Browns. [NJ.com]

All right, given that I both work for Disney and was born in 1990, I’m way too close to this story, so I’m just going to state the facts: The Disney Channel is planning to release the 100th Disney Channel Original Movie and will air a four-day marathon of the 51 most popular films in the franchise in May as part of the celebration. If you also consider the contemporary implications of “Motorcrossed” nearly monthly, feel free to reach out, and I’ll let you know more deets about the marathon. [Deadline]

$20
Do you use money? Same! Huge news out of the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday: Secretary Jack Lew announced that changes are coming to American currency. Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill (Jackson will appear on the reverse side), local Broadway star Alexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 bill, but he will be joined on the reverse side by Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Alice Paul. Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, will be joined on the $5 note by Martin Luther King Jr., Marian Anderson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Nothing will happen to Benjamin Franklin on the $100 bill, and I’m cool with that. [U.S. Treasury]

69 calls
New York City’s 311 service, which allows residents to file complaints that are slightly below 911-level emergencies and slightly above a letter to the editor, clocked 69 complaints from January 2010 to May 2015 regarding people smoking pot in city parks. The moral of Gawker’s analysis is that you should not smoke weed at the PS 14 Playground pool in Staten Island. I hope everyone made it out of 4/20 all right! [Gawker]

250 deaf attorneys
Approximate number of deaf attorneys in the United States, according to Teresa Curtin of the Weitz & Luxenberg law firm. Curtin was authorized to argue cases before the Supreme Court, along with 11 other deaf and hard-of-hearing lawyers, in a ceremony at the court Tuesday. [Reuters, h/t reader Brian Keller]

0 delegates
Number of delegates Ted Cruz appears to have won in Tuesday’s New York Republican presidential primary, which mathematically eliminated him from winning a majority of pledged delegates before the convention. Cruz insulted New York values earlier in the campaign, apparently not knowing that one of those values is not caring about people from Texas or what they think about your values. Presumably Cruz will do whatever anyone does when they learn they can’t hack it in New York, which is check out Philly or put all their hopes on a win in California. [The Associated Press]

SCR 9 
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, doing the most Utah governor thing in the history of both governors and Utah, has signed SCR 9, a resolution declaring pornography a public health hazard. [CNN]

18 seconds
I got one of those new chip credit cards, and it’s a total nightmare. It takes credit card machines forever to read the card, and society hasn’t yet developed the conversational mores for chitchat with the cashier during the half-minute the busted-up card reader is judging me. But there is hope on the horizon: Visa is launching software that can cut up to 18 seconds off the transaction time. I really wish I could go back to the swipe card because I don’t really need the extra security — that’s a problem for people with enough money where having a credit card stolen would be a cause for concern rather than a way for a thief to quickly overdraft at a Taco Bell. [The Wall Street Journal]

27 years old
UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor announced in a tweet Tuesday that he will retire early. It’s not certain if that means the 27-year-old’s retirement is effective immediately or if he’s just making a public declaration of his career ambition. [The Guardian]

Percentage of the New York GOP vote that went to Donald Trump, handing the native New Yorker a decisive and much-needed win and nearly all of the delegates New York has to offer. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won the state’s primary by 16 percentage points. [ABC News]

30 percent
The Islamic State’s monthly revenue is down almost 30 percent compared to a year ago, mostly due to U.S.-led air strikes on its petroleum-generating resources and lost territory. For some perspective: Blockbuster’s annual revenue dropped by 21 percent from FY 2009 to 2010, and look how many Blockbuster stores we have now. [Bloomberg]

54 percent
Based on FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus forecast, that’s Donald Trump’s average projected share of the vote in the New York primary today. He’s a greater than 99-percent favorite to win. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is also a 99-percent favorite; she averages 56 percent of the vote in our projections. Check out Harry Enten’s district-by-district guide to the GOP primary in New York. Also check back here tonight for our live blog following the results.

5,100 acceptances
It’s that time of year again, when some college or university sends out a galling number of accidental acceptance letters.

Number of new U.S. subscribers to Netflix in the first quarter, which beat analysts’ expectations. Still, the stock was down after news that Netflix’s projection for second-quarter subscriber growth was below that of analysts. [Bloomberg]

Percentage of California’s 17.2 million registered voters who are members of the super conservative American Independent Party. But, see, that “independent” part seems to be confusing people. A poll of 500 AIP members found 73 percent identified as having no party affiliation. [The Los Angeles Times]

12 refugees
Pope Francis brought 12 Syrian refugees to Vatican City, that country he runs, following a visit to Lesbos, Greece, “a waypoint for hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violence across the Middle East.” The three Muslim families will now be in the care of the Vatican. [National Catholic Reporter]

70 years
President Raul Castro, who is 84, thinks Cuba’s government is too old and future party officials should retire at age 70 to make room for younger people. The new age limits — following a referendum approving the reforms — would be introduced by 2021, and, in addition to the forcing-out-to-pasture part, 60 would become the top age allowed to get on the party’s central committee. [Reuters]

828+ meters
Minimum height of a new tower planned for Dubai by Emaar Properties PJSC. The new skyscraper would be “a notch taller” than the current tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which stands at 828 meters. Emaar Properties PJSC wants to have this undertaking finished by 2020. [Bloomberg]

Donor 9623
Donor 9623, whose sperm helped create at least 36 children, is not a model donor with an IQ of 160 on a Ph.D. track, as Xytex, a sperm bank based in Georgia, described him. He lied on his application and is, in fact, a college dropout “who has been diagnosed with bipolar and narcissistic personality disorders and schizophrenia and has spent time in prison for burglary.” [KTLA]

43,066th schedule
The NFL released its schedule Friday, the 43,066th one generated by the league’s schedule-making computers after 13 weeks of churning. The team behind the schedule tries to optimize for all sorts of various requests and demands, including stadium sharing, desired home openers, teams that want to have a bye after a London game and concerts.

4 movies
Director James Cameron announced that he will make four sequels to his 2009 film “Avatar,” aka Pocahontas in space, instead of two. It’s unclear what Cameron believes he failed to say with “Avatar” that requires four additional films, but we’ll see when the sequels come out in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023. [Variety]

7th-largest
If “The Walking Dead,” a comic published by Image Comics, were its own comic book company, it would be the seventh-largest production house by market share. The comic book and the television series it spawned are juggernauts; as a result, Image Comics and AMC, the network that airs the TV adaptation, have earned enough money and prestige to each undergo a creative renaissance. [FiveThirtyEight]

11 losses
In the eight GOP and 10 Democratic conventions since the Civil War that required more than one ballot to select a presidential nominee, the leader on the first ballot lost the nomination 11 times. That historical precedent is not great for Donald Trump, who could face a contested Republican convention in Cleveland, but when has that guy ever given a hoot about historical precedent? [Pew Research Center]

20 percent
How much the price of televisions sold online fell in February compared to a year earlier, according to a new price index from Adobe. The Consumer Price Index, which looks at television prices across the whole market, saw a 15 percent drop over the same period. [The New York Times]

51 cars
Czech police say that an officer driving drunk crashed his Jeep into 51 parked cars Tuesday. This is honestly pretty impressive and a general credit to the durability and sturdiness of both the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Czech liver. [Associated Press]

$175,000
Remember that time a University of California, Davis, cop blasted pepper spray into the eyes of a bunch of college students at point-blank range? UC Davis would rather you didn’t. The university has paid upwards of $175,000 to consultants to scrub the image from the internet. You know, this image of a UC Davis officer pepper spraying college students. [Sacramento Bee]

2 years
How long Taco Bell spent researching the best cheese-melting technique to ensure that tearing open a Quesalupa leaves the two taco halves connected by a cheesy string. Complaining about your Quesalupa’s cheesiness on social media is met with strict corporate justice. Taco Bell HQ will call an offending location to remind them of the proper technique: Fry the shell for 90 seconds and serve it within 15 minutes, otherwise the cheese will get hard. [Bloomberg]

6 inches
Three months ago, Inky, an octopus being detained at a holding facility in New Zealand calling itself the National Aquarium, mounted a daring escape to freedom that involved breaking free of his enclosure, dragging his body along the floor, and exiting to the ocean through a six-inch drain. The details of how the prisoner of conscience — who was held without trial for two years on evidence of his affiliation with the cephalopod sect of the Mollusca phylum — escaped are only now coming to light. Worth noting is that octopi are vastly intelligent and capable of memory, and I can only assume that Inky is radicalizing his brothers-in-multiple-arms for the coming war. [The Washington Post]

10 days
Theranos Inc., a beleaguered startup in the blood-testing market, is in hot water with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Regulators found major issues at the company’s laboratory in California and last month gave Theranos 10 days to produce evidence demonstrating why the Feds shouldn’t revoke its lab license and ban founder Elizabeth Holmes from the business for two years. [The Wall Street Journal]

73 wins
The Golden State Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 125-104 Wednesday night, becoming the first team in NBA history to get 73 wins in a regular season. [ESPN]

720 days
Ethan Couch, who killed four people driving drunk when he was a minor and received 10 years probation following a controversial “affluenza” defense, has been sentenced as an adult to nearly two years in jail after violating his probation, 180 days for each of the four deaths. [NPR]

Texas, Missouri, Georgia and Alabama are the only four states actively carrying out executions by lethal injection. Other states don’t have access to the drugs or have put executions on hold because of legal challenges. [The Marshall Project]

Net income for U.S. farms is estimated to be $54.8 billion this year, but $13.9 billion of that — about 25 percent — will come from federal farm aid payments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. [Bloomberg]

93 percent
A win for the Golden State Warriors over Memphis tonight would break the record for regular-season wins, for which Golden State is currently tied at 72-9. Our NBA predictions model gives the Warriors a 93 percent chance of winning the game, so if you see Michael Jordan or any of the other 1995-96 Chicago Bulls dropping banana peels on the court, do alert a referee. [FiveThirtyEight]

250 jobs
Deutsche Bank announced Tuesday that it will not move forward on a plan to add 250 jobs to its Cary, North Carolina, operations following the passage of a law that the bank said removes protections for LGBT people. PayPal announced a similar decision earlier this month, citing the same law. [MarketWatch]

$1.2 million
Scott Walker’s campaign for the presidency did not end well, and its lingering debts aren’t going away. Walker’s campaign owes something like $1.2 million, and has resorted to selling assorted T-shirts for $45. [Channel 3000]

956,166,000 pounds
Amount of cheese produced in the United States in February. The U.S. puts out roughly a billion pounds of the good stuff per month, with mozzarella accounting for slightly more than a third of the production and cheddar accounting for about a quarter. [FiveThirtyEight]

Donald Trump will be at least two votes short of his expectations in next week’s New York primary because his children Ivanka and Eric missed the deadline to register as Republicans. [The Daily Beast]

3 days
NASA has recovered the Kepler space telescope, which hunts for far-flung planets, after the spacecraft entered emergency mode last Thursday. Scientists are still trying to figure what went down during its three-day sabbatical. [Gizmodo]

53.7 percent
We’re a week away from the New York primary, and Donald Trump is the favorite to win the Republican race in both of FiveThirtyEight’s primary forecasts. The key thing to watch is how many delegates Trump pulls, which is a little complicated because New York delegates are allocated by congressional district as well as statewide. Right now, FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus projection gives Trump 53.7 percent of the vote. John Kasich and Ted Cruz are projected to roughly split the rest. [FiveThirtyEight]

20,000 bombs
The U.S. dropped upwards of 20,000 guided bombs and missiles into Iraq and Syria last year and has been transferring ammunition to its allies as part of the war against the Islamic State. This, among other things, has contributed to a diminished stockpile of bombs and missiles: The secretary of defense asked for funding for 45,000 smart bombs in the 2017 budget to replenish stocks. [Public Radio International]

$4.75 million
Estimated annual cost for the operation of a 180-foot yacht, according to the not-at-all-elitist-sounding U.S. Superyacht Association. This is a high maintenance fee for an already expensive product, so it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that some yachters are unhappy with the rate at which these boats are catching fire and burning into the sea. A string of yacht conflagrations around the world are the talk of the yacht club. [Bloomberg]

Goldman Sachs will pay a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion to borrowers and homeowners and $875 million in other claims as part of a $5 billion settlement over its sale of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. [CNBC]

3 holes-in-one
Danny Willett has won a weird Masters Tournament, one that last week saw a professional golfer fail to putt in a gimme ball seven times and on Sunday saw three holes-in-one — from Shane Lowry, Davis Love III and Louis Oosthuizen — on the same hole. [Digg]

Approximate amount of time it takes visual effects designers to blur the appropriate parts of an episode of “Naked and Afraid,” a Discovery Channel program where participants are always naked and presumably afraid after being dumped in the wilderness. [The New York Times]

72 wins
The Golden State Warriors tied the NBA record for regular-season wins Sunday after defeating the San Antonio Spurs 92-86. The Warriors have 72 wins, tying them with the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. They’ll have one chance — a game Wednesday against Memphis — to get a 73rd win and the record all to themselves. [ESPN]

Estimated number of tigers living in the wild, up from an estimated 3,200 in 2010. The problem of tiger conservation remains — deforestation and habitat destruction are still major threats to tiger populations — but it’s a good sign. [Scientific American]

$23.48 million
The Melissa McCarthy vehicle “The Boss” was the first to humble “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” at the box office, narrowly beating the superhero film’s domestic haul by $45,000 this weekend. “The Boss” pulled in $23.48 million in its opening weekend, while “Bats v. Supes” got $23.43 million in its third. [BoxOfficeMojo]

$5.5 billion
Size of the U.S. market for soap products, whose manufacturers are facing scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration over the chemicals in antibacterial soap. Evidence increasingly shows that these soaps may be doing more harm than good for the typical consumer and the FDA has asked soap manufacturers to demonstrate that their antibacterial products really are better than regular soap.

5 swipes
Freakin’ tourists: Hillary Clinton needed five swipes of a Metrocard in order to gain entrance to the New York City subway Wednesday as part of a campaign stop aboard the MTA. In fairness, her opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, was unaware that the civilization of New York had moved beyond subway tokens up to last week. [POLITICO]

Ernie Els, by all means a rather good golfer, set a new Masters record Thursday after taking 9 strokes on a par-4 hole. The video of Els needing seven putts to finish the job is the only time in the history of the sport where golf was simply too brutal to watch. [ESPN]

€6,000
“Platooning” is a fuel-saving strategy developed by the trucking business where two or more trucks connected by Wi-Fi autonomously follow each other. This can lead to some massive savings on fuel: The pair uses 15 percent less fuel, which for two trucks platooning 100,000 miles can save €6,000, or about $6,820. [Quartz]

1.06 million miles
Secretary of State John Kerry is now the most well-traveled of any of the people who held the gig: After a flight to Bahrain on Wednesday he hit 1,060,000 miles traveled, beating previous record-holder Condoleezza Rice. [PBS]

$86 million
Amount raised for the general election by four super PACs — Priorities USA Action, Ready PAC, Correct The Record and American Bridge 21st Century — the first three of which support Hillary Clinton and the last of which aids Democrats with opposition research. That number is a minimum, keep in mind, as three of the PACs haven’t disclosed how much they’ve raised in 2016 yet. [Center for Public Integrity]

$2.1 trillion
Amount that would be added to the U.S. economy if it increased the proportion of women who worked from 64 percent to 74 percent, according to a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute. [BBC]

6 weeks
Tuesday the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to require employers to offer six weeks of paid leave for parents. This is great for new mothers, but is also, compared to the rest of the world, fantastic news for fathers, given that the citywide paternity leave policy now puts it ahead of many European nations. [FiveThirtyEight]

8.5 percent
According to a new report from the World Health Organization, 422 million adults have diabetes, which makes the worldwide rate 8.5 percent. That rate was 4.7 percent in 1980. [Bloomberg]

76 meteorites
Christie’s is auctioning off 76 meteorites later this month, which brings up the question of how precisely to put a price on a rock that fell from space. It used to be that they were priced based on weight, but since some meteorites are unambiguously cooler than others — anyone would admit a wayward chunk of moon has a lot more panache than some phoned-in detritus from the asteroid belt — meteorphiles took a page of of the diamond business’ book and coined the four S’s: size, shape, science and story.

$3,000
Does your dog have an Instagram account? Does that account have 150,000 to 250,000 followers? Well, that’s a good dog. It can also be a lucrative pooch, thanks to groups like The Dog Agency that will serve as reps for your canine and can fetch $3,000 per sponsored post for an account of that size. [The Wall Street Journal]

$30 million
George Mason University said it received $30 million in gifts after announcing that its law school would be named the “Antonin Scalia School of Law.” The university quickly announced the school would be named Antonin Scalia Law School, because nobody wants to say they got their degree from the A.S.S.O.L.

400 employees
PayPal has rescinded plans announced two weeks ago to open up a global operations center in the Charlotte area in light of a new law passed in North Carolina. In a post on the company website, President and CEO Dan Schulman said the law “invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens.” The company said the center would have employed 400 people. [Paypal]

$1,302
The filthy casuals at the FEC found that GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter racked up $1,302 worth of payments for Steam games on his campaign credit card. Hunter claims it is a mix up and pointed to his son accidentally using the wrong card to buy hella games. Regrettably, while it would be rather apt, for unfortunate reasons this political scandal can not be called “gamergate.” [The San Diego Union Tribune]

$140 million
David Tepper moved from New Jersey to Florida, and the hedge fund manager’s departure could cause legitimate issues for Jersey’s revenue calculation. Basically, 40 percent of the state’s revenue comes from personal income taxes; a third of that comes from 1 percent of taxpayers; and a 1 percent forecasting error means $140 million either way. With Tepper out, budgeters are legitimately concerned about how much the state could miss out on. [Bloomberg]

The magnitude of leaks appears to be growing only larger: Compared to the 1.73 gigabyte leak WikiLeaks obtained of State Department communications, the latest reveal of 2.6 terabytes of data from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca takes the cake. The early findings from the leaked documents and emails paint a picture of a firm entrenched in the nitty gritty of making the kind of shell companies the rich and powerful use to squirrel away lots of money. [Wired]

$15 per hour
Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York each signed legislation that would gradually increase minimum wage in their states to $15 per hour. California will have a statewide $15 minimum wage by 2022, while New York’s increase is tied to economic indicators, with the wage going to $15 in New York City in three years. [ABC News]

Last night saw the NCAA Men’s tournament end with a championship win for Villanova, but tonight the women’s tournament comes to a close with a final between the University of Connecticut and Syracuse. The FiveThirtyEight model has Connecticut with a 97 percent chance of winning it. In related news: I have crushed my enemies, I have seen them driven before me, and I have heard the lamentations of their companions. I totally won the FiveThirtyEight office pool. [FiveThirtyEight]

$236,000
Clubs will pay a bunch of money for famous people — or people adjacent to famous people, like Kardashian-proximate Scott Disick — just to show up and drink some bubbles for an hour or so in the VIP area. Like with most stories about famous people and money, it’s difficult to narrow down a precise fee for different levels of fame, but thanks to a lawsuit from a club in Vegas we know that Nicki Minaj is being asked to a return a $236,000 fee for allegedly not upholding the terms of the deal: spend 60 minutes in Chateau starting at midnight.

12 to 14 movies
Amazon has said it intends to release 12 to 14 original movies annually through Amazon Studios. The first such film was Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq,” which was released on Amazon to Prime users in February, soon after it was released in 305 theaters to qualify for awards consideration. Amazon Studios bought four independent films at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. [Wired]

People taking the sleep-aid drug Belsomra fell asleep six minutes faster than those taking a placebo and stayed asleep 16 minutes longer, according to the company’s large-scale clinical trial. Despite this modest effect, its manufacturer, Merck, spent $96 million promoting the drug last year, and analysts believe over the next decade it will become the top-selling insomnia drug on the market.

50 delegates
South Carolina’s Republican party makes candidates pledge to support the eventual nominee in order to get on the primary ballot. Donald Trump made that pledge and got on the primary ballot, and later won 50 delegates in the state. But on Tuesday, he said he has been treated unfairly and will no longer pledge to support the eventual nominee. This has thrown those 50 delegates into doubt, according to the South Carolina GOP chair. Sad! [TIME]

$3,600
How much a women’s soccer player on the U.S. national team makes per exhibition game, with a bonus of $1,350 for a win. If that person was playing for the men’s national team, the game check would be $5,000 with a win bonus of between $6,250 and $17,625. This disparity — plus the relative success of the world champion women’s soccer team compared with the not-world champion men’s soccer team — has led five players to file a federal wage discrimination complaint.

The guy who currently has the best NCAA men’s tournament bracket on Yahoo, James Kiki, forgot to pick a winner. This means there’s no way he can win the $50,000 prize for best bracket. It appears this isn’t a unique situation: of the top 30 brackets on Yahoo, three of them did not pick a champ. [Deadspin]

Using the top daily story on Memeorandum, a political news aggregator, as a proxy for what the top political news story of the day is, Donald Trump has led the news on 104 of the 286 days between when he launched his campaign and this past Sunday. That’s 36 percent of the time. When the top political story was about the campaign, Trump has owned 52 percent of the political news days. Sad! [FiveThirtyEight]

988 delegates
Barring a massive victory in New York, Bernie Sanders is running out of ways to win the Democratic nomination. He’s 988 delegates away from a majority, and even now you really have to twist the math and throw spaghetti at the wall in order to plot a conceivable path in which he wins the nomination.

21,764 households
Number of households in New York City that reported incomes over $1 million in 2013, which is 47 percent higher than the level in 2009.

The ’90s were pretty great, according to lots of people. Some of those people were musicians who did the vast majority of their successful work in the decade, but not much since.

A new study of 400 colleges from a retired Duke University professor has found that there are a lot more A’s being given out than there used to be.

Grade inflation has been on a steady rise for the past few decades, according to the research. [The Washington Post]

171 delegates
Number of delegates obtained by Sen. Marco Rubio prior to his exit from the race. Rubio’s zombie campaign is trying to retain control over those delegates until the convention. But it has already lost some of them: the Cruz camp plucked five Rubio delegates from Louisiana. But as a certain frontrunner would say, exerting what leverage you can is a crucial part of the Art of the Deal. [The Associated Press]

$760 million
There are nearly 16,000 American babies that are born premature each year at least in part because of air pollution, according to a new study by a team of medical researchers. The extended hospital stays and medication the babies require cost $760 million annually. [Reuters]

$1 billion
Spotify has raised a billion dollars in debt financing from investors. The Swedish music company lost €162 million in 2014, when we last got a look at the company’s books. Since then, a whole bunch of competitors like Apple — and if you read the $10 entry of this post, now SoundCloud — have entered the streaming space. [Wall Street Journal]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. 

1.5 percent
Pre-tournament probability that Syracuse University would make it to the Final Four of this year’s NCAA men’s basketball tournament. But hey, guess what, here we are. In the last 11 tournaments, only three Final Four teams have been less likely to get there than this year’s Syracuse squad, according to FiveThirtyEight’s pre-tournament odds. I guess that means all the people who went to Syracuse in the office pool are going to win this year, but at least Syracuse isn’t Duke. [FiveThirtyEight]

5 words
A new study looked at 16 billion emails sent by 2 million people on Yahoo Mail. A Yahoo Labs and University of Southern California team found that when they looked just at messages sent between regular corresponders, the most-likely reply was five words long, and more than 90 percent of replies were sent within a day. Based on extensive personal experience, I figure that’s because if you don’t reply within a day, you will never reply. This is as good a time as any to remind you Email Debt Forgiveness Day is right around the corner. [Scientific American]

37,000 feet
An Alaskan volcano is spewing ash and detritus 37,000 feet into the air in a plume over 400 miles long. The Pavlof volcano, which is on the finger of Alaska that that juts westward towards Russia, began erupting Sunday for the first time since 2014. It’s no Eyjafjallajökul, but pilots are still steering clear of it. [CNN]

44,000 signatures
A petition signed by 44,000 people to allow open carry of firearms at this summer’s Republican National Convention was smacked down by the Secret Service, which basically said, “lol absolutely not, are you kidding?” [ABC News]

7 million people
The USGS is out with a new report analyzing risks to Americans who live in areas that may suffer from “induced earthquakes” because of high levels of fracking in an area. About 7 million people live in areas that could suffer such quakes. [The Washington Post]

$14 billion
Starwood Hotels & Resorts has been aggressively pursued by Marriott for a purchase, but just as a deal appeared done, an investment group led by Anbang Insurance Group Co. of China swooped in with a $14 billion offer, throwing several months of work from Marriott right out the well-appointed hotel room window.

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Huge thanks to Neil Paine for covering for me when I was out with the all-March Madness SigDig. You can find him @Neil_Paine. 

74 delegates
Preliminary estimate for the number of delegates Bernie Sanders will win in Washington, which held caucuses Saturday. We just ended the part of the campaign with a large number of caucuses, terrain that favors Sanders. But for the rest of the cycle, most of the action is in primaries, contests Sanders has done relatively poorly in. [FiveThirtyEight]

808 subscribers
Subscription count for “Tomahawk and Long Rifle,” the quarterly publication of The American Mountain Men, a club for dudes who like doing DiCaprio-in-The-Revenant reenactments. Since the films came out, the magazine has seen interest rise and says it is now fielding six or eight new subscriptions per day. This bolsters my plan for how to save the news business, namely having Leonardo DiCaprio make movies about subjects of struggling magazines. [The Wall Street Journal]

1,901 appearances
Judging by their comic book lives, Batman and Superman are each others’ best friend, unlike what is implied in “Batman v Superman,” their grimdark movie that came out last weekend. They’ve appeared in at least 1,901 comic books together over their respective careers — Superman hangs out with Batman almost as much as he hangs out with his girlfriend, Lois Lane. The Bat hangs out with Supes more than any individual Robin. [FiveThirtyEight]

5,532 titles
Number of titles available on Netflix in the United States on March 23 based on the count of AllFlicks, a site that catalogs Netflix’s library. That’s way down from January of 2014, when Netflix had 8,103 titles, according to AllFlicks. Part of this drop could be the result of increased competition from other streaming services. [AllFlicks]

$100 million
The nation of Jordan will get a $100 million loan from the World Bank to create jobs for Jordanians and 100,000 of its 640,000 registered Syrian refugees. Lebanon will receive a similar loan to work towards universal enrollment in school for both Lebanese and Syrian kids by next year. [The Associated Press]

$170.1 million
“Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice” made $170.1 million in North America over the weekend despite reviews that ranged from tepid to scathing. It was the largest opening ever for March and also for any Warner Bros movie. [CNN]

Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Regular host Walt Hickey is still on vacation, and NCAA basketball is still happening. As a result, I’m still here with another all-March Madness SigDig. Enjoy!

0.015 rating points
There are close matchups, and then there are close matchups. Tonight’s Notre Dame-Wisconsin tilt belongs in that second category, with the teams separated by just 0.015 points in Ken Pomeroy’s ratings. It’s basically as close to a coin flip as you can get — our prediction model lists the game as exactly 50-50 for both teams. [Kenpom.com]

19 percentage points
In a Sweet 16 field largely devoid of Cinderella candidates, 10th-seeded Syracuse will have to do. According to the FiveThirtyEight model, they started the tourney with a 1 percent chance of making the Final Four; now that probability is 19 percentage points higher, the biggest gain of any team left standing. [FiveThirtyEight]

1995 season
The University of Virginia will be looking to make its first Elite 8 appearance since the 1995 tournament when it takes on Iowa State Friday evening. By most measures — including winning percentage, the AP poll and the Simple Rating System — this year’s Cavaliers are better than the 1995 version, but they’ll have to win to prove it — the bracket doesn’t lie. [Sports-Reference.com]

3,950 wins
North Carolina and Indiana are two of the most storied programs in the history of college basketball, having combined for 3,950 victories in 5,728 games since 1901, and they’ll face each other in Friday’s late game. With a 73 percent chance of winning, UNC has the edge to take win No. 3,951, according to our model. [Sports-Reference.com]

118 wins
The University of Connecticut women’s basketball team has been completely unstoppable with Breanna Stewart leading the way these past few seasons. They’ve won 118 of their last 119 games — all by double-digits, and all but 18 by 20 or more points. UConn looks to extend their run against Mississippi State Saturday morning. [FiveThirtyEight]

This is Significant Digits, your daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. With Walt Hickey away on vacation — and with the third round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament getting underway tonight — I’m hijacking SigDig today and tomorrow in the name of March Madness. Enjoy!

6 ACC schools
Six schools in the Sweet 16 — Duke, Miami, North Carolina, Virginia, Notre Dame and Syracuse — hail from the Atlantic Coast Conference, setting a record (at least, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985). The ACC had tied the previous record of five last season, so at this rate they’ll claim all 16 slots by 2026. [USA Today]

24.5 points
In their two NCAA Tournament wins thus far, Villanova has outscored foes by 49 combined points, or 24.5 per game — more than any other team in the Sweet 16 field. Granted, one of those games was against 15th-seeded UNC Asheville, but the Wildcats also beat No. 7 seed Iowa by 19 and have exceeded the scoring margin our Elo ratings would expect by 11.8 points per contest. They’ll try to keep that hot streak going tonight against Miami. [Sports-Reference.com]

63 points
Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield has enjoyed a season for the ages this year, and it’s carrying over into the NCAA Tournament, where he’s scored a tourney-best 63 points (31.5 per game) on a scorching 73.2 true shooting percentage. But maybe it’s best for the Sooners if Hield doesn’t keep that average up against Texas A&M tonight — Oklahoma was 4-5 in conference play this season when Hield scored 30 or more points, and 8-1 when the Sooner scoring attack was more balanced. [Sports-Reference.com]

5 starters
Each basketball team has five starters, and in the case of Maryland’s game against Kansas tonight, each Terrapin starter will be taller than the Jayhawk lined up across from him at tip-off. As a team, Maryland has the fourth-biggest roster in the nation, with an average height a good inch and a half taller than Kansas. But will it matter against the skilled Jayhawks? Our model says “probably not” — we’ve got Kansas favored with a 73 percent probability of winning, despite Maryland’s size advantage. [KC Kingdom]

109th best
If defense really does win championships, nobody clued in Oregon or Duke. The combatants in tonight’s late game ranked 43rd and 109th, respectively, in schedule-adjusted defensive efficiency this season, per Ken Pomeroy’s stats. Aside from their 116th-place finish in 2013-14, this year’s Blue Devils have given Coach K more defensive fits than any Duke squad since Pomeroy started crunching numbers 15 seasons ago. [KenPom.com]

More than $30 million
With those aforementioned six entries in the Sweet 16, the ACC stands to make a cool $30 million, at least, from an NCAA cash pool that rewards conferences when their teams go deep in the tournament. Naturally, none of that money will ever be seen by Brice Johnson, Malcolm Brogdon, Grayson Allen, Angel Rodriguez or any of the other players who powered those teams to the Sweet 16. [ESPN.com]

CORRECTION (March 24, 5:35 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described the average height difference between the starters on Kansas and Maryland’s men’s basketball teams. Maryland’s starters are, on average, about an inch and a half taller, not a foot and half.

Good news: I’m going on vacation starting tomorrow. Better news: Significant Digits will be run by my colleague Neil Paine on Thursday and Friday and will be all about March Madness! 

4-1
The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Cuban national team 4-1 in front of President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro, who did the wave. Obama and Castro did the wave! [ESPN]

17.4 percent
Web traffic drop for Vice Media between January and February, which says less about the health of its core product — Vice.com’s traffic was up — and more about the crazy ways websites boost their numbers for advertisers. Basically, smaller websites sign away their audience numbers to larger sites like Vice in exchange for better ad rates. These small sites get better ad inventory, and the larger sites can claim a higher audience. But in February, Distractify, one of the sites that helped Vice pad its numbers, essentially imploded. Live by the click, die by the click. [Variety]

20 houses
Actor Jeremy Renner has been on a house-flipping spree in the greater Hollywood area, buying at least 20 houses in the past 15 years, renovating them and selling them for a profit. As far as hobbies go, it’s nowhere near “being Hawkeye,” but it’s neat. [Bloomberg]

58 delegates
Donald Trump had a decent night on Tuesday, winning all of Arizona’s 58 delegates. Utah, however, went hard for Cruz, and American Samoa will send its delegates to the Republican convention uncommitted. [FiveThirtyEight]

37.8 million
Approximate number of tweets from @VENETHIS on Twitter, or 15,000 per day since the user joined the service in 2009. That’s by far the highest number of tweets for any single account by a long shot. [FiveThirtyEight]

50 trillion stars
When you go fishing for supernovae, you have to cast a pretty wide net: Scientists were able to catch two stars — KSN 2011a and KSN 2011d — exploding, but did so by monitoring light every 30 minutes for three years from a field of 500 galaxies comprised of 50 trillion stars. Nailed it! [The Washington Post]

1-in-3,333 chance of winning
Probability of the Texas A&M men’s basketball team coming back from a 12-point deficit against Northern Iowa with 35 seconds left, which is exactly what they did on Sunday. These kids will, for the rest of their life, get to be Han Solo barking “never tell me the odds!” at everyone from their accountant to their bookie to their GPS system. They have earned it. [FiveThirtyEight]

41 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe that climate change will pose a “serious threat” to them in their lifetime, according to Gallup. I suppose the people who still refuse to acknowledge the threat of climate change are teenagers, people in landlocked states like Arizona and Utah, or those weirdos obsessed with cruises and boat trips. [The Guardian]

73 percent
Compared to high school students in the 1980s, teens from 2010 to 2012 were 73 percent more likely to report trouble sleeping. That’s just one example among many — young people today report having far more mental health problems than in past generations. [Quartz]

92 percent
Utah and Arizona vote today, in the first Tuesday in several Tuesdays to not earn a distinctive superlative from folks like me. Trump has a 92 percent chance of winning in Arizona, according to our polls-plus model. Cruz has a 98 percent chance of winning Utah. And we don’t have a forecast for how Democrats in Arizona and Utah will vote because, well, Democrats in Arizona and Utah? We’re not wizards, people. (Seriously, though, it’s because there haven’t been enough polls of Democrats in those states.) [FiveThirtyEight]

$8,250
Cost for a suite during peak season aboard Carnival’s newest cruise to lovely communist Cuba. It will be the first U.S. cruise line to dock in Cuba in over 50 years. [Bloomberg]

£200 million
Cost to construct a polar research vessel to explore the Antarctic. The vessel will no doubt help us understand the complicated and fragile marine ecosystem of a remote part of this beautiful world. Because the Natural Environment Research Council decided to name the vessel based on an internet poll, the ship may, according to current results, end up with the name “RRS Boaty McBoatface.” Full disclosure: Support for this name is right up there with that flamethrower bill Rep. Eliot Engel of New York pitched in January when it comes to this column’s few political stances. [The Independent]

16 percent
That’s the current “diversion rate” in New York — the weight of recyclables picked up by the city’s sanitation department divided by the overall weight of refuse hauled out. It’s much lower than the national rate of 34.4 percent. What gives? First, some businesses use private sanitation companies and aren’t part of the municipal system. Second — and this is, according to the Department of Sanitation, a bigger deal than one might think — recycling scavengers take recyclables off the curb and cash them in on their own. [The New York Times]

33 games
According to ESPN’s Stats & Info Department, the Golden State Warriors’ loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday was the 33rd consecutive regular season game played at San Antonio that the Warriors have lost. [ESPN S&I]

42 percentage points
Ted Cruz’s lead over Donald Trump in Utah, according to a new poll from The Salt Lake Tribune. Mormons appear to dislike Trump … a lot. He’s doing poorly in Utah counties with higher mormon populations. Given the Mormon church’s experience with state-sponsored antagonism, Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslim immigration, specifically targeting a minority religion, is not likely to go over well among Utahans. Sad! [Salt Lake Tribune, Buzzfeed]

Georgia House Bill 757
The Georgia General Assembly passed a bill that would forbid the government from applying penalties to an organization that denies services to people that are gay as long as the organization feels such services would violate its religious beliefs. The Georgia law, which Gov. Nathan Deal may not sign, is a lot like that Indiana “religious freedom law” that sparked a backlash about a year ago. The NFL is not happy with Georgia and has dropped the hammer, basically saying — and I’m paraphrasing here — “gosh, that’s a nice looking stadium y’all are building in Atlanta. It would be awful if you enacted a law like this one because we would have to think really hard about not having a Super Bowl there, especially in 2019.” [Deadspin]

3.3 million miles
Congratulations, everybody! In all likelihood we will have, as a planet, successfully dodge two comets in as many days this week. Comet 252P/LINEAR passes us on Monday and comet P/2016 BA14 will blow by the earth on Tuesday, at distances of 3.3 and 2.2 million miles respectively. All I’m saying is if you’re having a tough day just remind yourself, “hey, we dodged a bullet today,” or whatever the Oort cloud could fashion as a rudimentary bullet. [Quartz]

$29.1 million
Domestic haul for “The Divergent Series: Allegiant,” which left it in second place at the box office during its debut weekend. We saw some early signs of this last year, but 2016 could be brutal for adaptations of young adult novels, previously a stalwart genre in Hollywood. [Bloomberg]

Also, welcome to the first day of FiveThirtyEight’s third year under ESPN. Yesterday was our 2nd birthday. Didn’t you see everyone partying in green until the A.M.? Yeah that was totally for us. 

0 for 124
Based on the low-but-not-zero probability of a 16 seed in the NCAA Men’s basketball tournament beating a 1 seed, by now we’d have expected at least one of them to have won a game. The probability of our current situation — where the record for 16-seeds is 0 for 124 — is only about 5 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

2 ballistic missiles
North Korea, which just the other day sentenced a University of Virginia student to 15 years of prison and hard labor for allegedly stealing a poster, Friday appears to have shot 2 medium-rangeballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. They travelled a distance of about 500 miles, according to the South Korean military. [ABC News]

6-12 inches
Because everything is awful and the moment you thought we all had a good thing going is fleeting, a Nor’easter appears to be developing that could very well dump a bunch of snow across the northeast. The New York office of the National Weather service says we can expect 6 to 12 inches from the storm. And just when I had switched from peacoats to hoodies, too. [Slate]

53 percent
It’s the kind of story that you cannot stop reading even though you slowly grow to loathe everyone profiled in it: There’s a huge rise in a group of clothing sales companies aiming to be “Brotailers,” that is, retailers that cater to bros and their ilk. A fashion PR agency found that 53 percent of adult men — adults! — described their style as “basic bro” rather than, say, “practical” or “professional” or whatever else grown men are calling khakis these days to feel cool. Still, men’s fashion has been the fastest growing thing in online retail over the past five years, so there is coin to be made that would otherwise presumably be spent on donating to the old frat, mediocre beer and the Gronk Cruise. [Bloomberg]

76.5 percent fresh
Median Rotten Tomatoes score of movies in which John Goodman is the second-billed performer, which is really good. The guy is at his best when he’s the stalwart #2 of a movie, which means that “10 Cloverfield Lane” doing so well among critics shouldn’t come as a surprise. [FiveThirtyEight]

90 percent sure
King Tut’s tomb may have two new chambers in it, which would be cool because the fella was married and we never did find Nefertiti. Based on a scan of the tomb with radar, Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh El Damati said that they’re about 90 percent sure they have located an additional 2 chambers. [CNN]

3 delegates
Something very interesting happened in the state of Illinois among Trump voters. Home of weird elections, the state has some pretty odd election rules when it comes to delegates in GOP primaries. Namely, at the district level, Republican Illinoisans vote for 3 individual people who declare their personal preference for president, rather than the candidate they would prefer to get 3 generic delegates. Anyway! Turns out this practice may have hurt Trump in Illinois, mainly because three delegates with the last names of “Sadiq,” “Fakroddin” and “Uribe,” substantially underperformed their fellow delegates — all with, for all intents and purposes, hella white names like “Nordstrom,” “Minch” and “Hartmann” — to the tune of Donald Trump getting 3 fewer delegates than otherwise possible. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 senators
Number of Republican senators still seated in the upper house who voted to confirm Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to replace former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, in 1997. Five sitting GOP senators voted against him. [The Week]

15 years
A University of Virginia student who was arrested in North Korea for allegedly stealing a poster was sentenced to 15 years of prison and hard labor, according to reports on Wednesday. North Korea’s highest court found the 21-year-old Otto Warmbier guilty. [NPR]

94 percent
We’ve had a whole lot of election news over the past few weeks, but here is my secret favorite: Following Marco Rubio’s exit from the race, Predictwise has it as a 94 percent chance that the next President of the United States is from New York. That distinction is shared by Clinton, Trump and the declined-to-run-but-hey-anything-is-possible Michael Bloomberg. Sure, Fillmore left something to be desired and Van Buren lacked pizzazz, but hey, both of the Roosevelts were pretty rad — you guys should be excited for this! [Predictwise]

125 applications
Last year, a guy named Martin Shkreli cranked up the price of a rare anti-fungal drug used to fight the effects of AIDS from $13.50 per pill to $750. Now the FDA is trying to stop those kinds of shenanigans by expediting the review process for generic drugs that will compete with brand-name off-patent drugs that are only produced by a single company. Basically, competitors can get to the market faster, making the whole “profiteering from the dying” business model slightly less financially sound. FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh told Bloomberg in an email that the agency expects up to 125 current applications will be expedited. [Ars Technica]

$700
Chipotle is having a bad time. Sales are even lower than expected, and the quarter that was supposed to be its rebound to the top was just more of the same. The last time Chipotle Mexican Grill stock was above $700 was back in October, before all this E. coli news dropped. The stock was recently teetering near $500. Still, that $700 number is now crucial for co-CEOs Monty Moran and Steve Ells, as a big chunk of their compensation is now tied to the stock hanging above $700 for 30 consecutive days. [Bloomberg]

<1 percent
Missouri was the site of not one but two neck-and-neck primary races, with an incredibly slim margin separating Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, each of whom gained approximately 41 percent of the vote, and slightly more than 1,000 votes separating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, each of whom got about half the vote. The races are close enough that absentee and provisional ballots could swing the results, even though 100 percent of precincts have reported. [ABC News, CNN]

11 months
After an 11-month campaign in which he was, at times, considered the presumptive establishment nominee of the Republican party, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has suspended his campaign leaving only three remaining candidates — Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and local businessman and current front-runner Donald Trump, the winner of the Florida primary. If I got the previous sentence as an email this time last year I would have laughed and laughed and laughed. Now, not so much, you know? [ABC News]

18 meters of tweed
A racehorse showed up to the Cheltenham Festival dressed in a three-piece tweed suit, which truly must be seen to be believed. I am not from the U.K. but after reading up on the festival — it is a “prestigious jump meeting” for horses where people wear a lot of tweed — I now understand why England has had as many revolutions as it has. It took 18 meters of tweed to outfit the horse, enough to clothe 10 literary studies professors. [CNN] 

24 hours
The D.C. Metro will shut down for an estimated 24 hours starting midnight due to safety fears about the dilapidated and frequently flammable transit system. The day will be spent doing emergency inspections of cables. Kids get off scot-free playing hooky from school and people in the D.C. area are encouraged to telecommute, which means nothing is going to get done. Washington is broken. [The Washington Post]

$58.73
How much quarterback Matt Cassel received as a performance bonus for his brief time on the Buffalo Bills last year. Cassel played one snap before being traded to Dallas, where his bonus was $28,241.22. Ten NFL players received a performance bonus less than $500 last season. [ESPN]

64 percent
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each achieved a massive win in the state of Florida. While Trump took 46 percent of the vote, he got each of the 99 delegates up for grabs in the winner-take-all state. Clinton on the other hand won about 64 percent of the vote, and due to the delegate allocation of the Democratic primary will expand her delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders by a substantial amount. As Clinton knows far too well, Democratic primaries are won and lost by such delegate leads. [ABC News]

3 charged officers
Brandon Matthew Sontag, Nicole Lynn Quijas and Jorge Arroyo — three Santa Ana police officers who were caught on camera in June apparently eating candy bars and destroying video cameras at a medical pot dispensary they had just raided — were each charged with misdemeanors by the Orange County District Attorney’s office for damaging the video equipment. As for the weed edibles? The DA says there’s no evidence that the officers consumed any marijuana products, and what they were eating on camera was nothing more than “snacks available to staff.” Right. Sontag was also charged for vandalism for allegedly destroying the video cameras. [OC Weekly]

17 seconds
This Friday is huge for soon-to-be graduates of U.S. medical schools, as it’s when they’ll be told their residency hospital match by the National Residency Match Program. It’s been 23 days since they submitted their ranked preferences, but here’s the weird thing: According to one medical student’s replication of the matching algorithm — it’s based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, and while the NRMP’s specific implementation of the algorithm and its input data isn’t public, it can be spoofed — the actual matching of 34,000 some-odd applicants to 30,000 some-odd hospital sots only takes 17 seconds on some basic hardware. So why the crushing 23 day wait? Well, there’s a lot of credential verification that has to go on. After all, these are doctors we’re talking about here. [Medium]

51 percent
According to the Engaging News Project at the University of Texas at Austin, that’s the percentage of Americans who do not comment on news stories and also do not read the comments on news stories. Only 14 percent of Americans had posted a comment on the stories, while the rest are presumably lurkers. [Nieman Lab]

70 percent
The University of Connecticut is the huge favorite to win the NCAA Women’s Basketball tournament, based on a FiveThirtyEight analysis of the bracket released yesterday. The Huskies have made it to the Final Four the the past eight years. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

99 delegates
Today is pretty huge for this election. On the GOP side, both Florida and Ohio will allocate their respective 99 and 66 delegates to whoever wins a mere plurality, and there’s a solid chance that is Donald Trump in each state. This could be the de facto end of the line for mainstream opposition to the Trump bid. On the GOP side, 367 delegates will be up for grabs; on the Democratic side, there will be 691 pledged delegates. Just like last week, I’ll be on ABC News’ live stream intermittently from like 7 p.m. onwards with more coverage of the primary contests. Check it out! [FiveThirtyEight]

$733 million
Sony will buy out the stake held by Michael Jackson’s estate in Sony/ATV Music Publishing, their joint music business. Sony is paying a $733 million lump sum for the 50 percent stake with future payments to come. This will give Sony control over 4 million songs, which is nice in the era of streaming. [Bloomberg]

2 years
In today’s edition of “stories that made me ignore my best friends during brunch on Saturday because they hooked me that good,” Richard Simmons has disappeared from public life for the past two years, has reportedly cut off ties with old friends, and those friends fear he may be held against his will in his home, the Daily News reports. Seriously, “Hey you hear about this Richard Simmons thing?” was basically the only thing I said to people for the rest of the day. [The New York Daily News]

8 minutes
Louisiana is in a dire financial situation and state legislators had to pass some pretty big tax increases, despite their misgivings, just to keep the lights on. Parts of the state will see sales taxes rise above 10 percent, and overall approximately $1 billion in new taxation was passed in the final eight minutes of the session. [The Advocate]

10 pounds
Ten pounds of bat guano — poop, that is — was found above the desk of Ken Lawson, a Florida regulator. That sucks, don’t get me wrong, but imagine being the cop assigned to investigate this particular crime. Your place on the totem pole becomes pretty clear pretty immediately when you pull that assignment. [Associated Press]

19 percent
The University of Kansas has the highest chance of winning the NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament — March Madness! — based on the FiveThirtyEight model. (The women’s bracket will be announced later today.) The other No. 1 seeds are the University of North Carolina, Oregon and the University of Virginia. [FiveThirtyEight]

20 percent
Average estimate of the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months according to a monthly survey of economists, down from 21 percent a month ago but up from 10 percent six months ago. [The Wall Street Journal]

11,000 data centers
The federal government has a lot of data, OK? A new policy would force agencies to get permission from higher-ups before building a new data center, which seems silly until you hear that the Feds already have upwards of 11,000 data centers. The outdated tech housed within — some of it predates the ’80s — makes up about three quarters of the $80 billion IT budget. [Nextgov]

According to the White House, the share of families who have a hard time affording diapers. A new program will give low-income Americans access to cheaper diapers. [CNN]

21 years old
California’s legislature has voted to raise the age limit on buying tobacco products to 21 from 18. The bill now awaits the governor’s signature. The legislation would also apply to vapers who use electronic cigarettes, a move that would surely devastate the guy who is somehow walking in front of me every day on the way to work blowing sick clouds. [Associated Press]

59 percent
Percentage of Florida Republicans who think Sen. Marco Rubio should suspend his campaign should he lose in the winner-take-all primary in the state next Tuesday. Sad! [Washington Post/Univision News Poll]

29.0
People are jazzed about this whole democracy thing America has going on right now: 29 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the states that held primary contests through March 6. That’s the highest level of turnout since 2008, but keep in mind that as we continue through the primary process and the contests potentially become less significant, that share may drop. [Pew Research Center]

1,700 names
A list of purported Islamic State members has been obtained by intelligence agencies, Sky News reports, but there’s plenty of reason to be skeptical of the list. It apparently includes tens of thousands of names, but only 1,700 identifiable ones. This is the kind of list where you really want to be sure it’s legit in case of a false positive, but it’s a potentially massive intelligence gain for the powers fighting the Islamic State. [The Washington Post]

11,000 amendments
Number of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Only 27 of those stuck, and many of the rest were really, really dumb. To commemorate the 225th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, the National Archives is apparently pulling everything it has from the “HORRIBLE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS, A-F” filing cabinet.

Well the final results are in, and it appears that Marco Rubio won a total of two delegates in Hawaii after being shut out of Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho on Tuesday. Just a dismal showing. [FiveThirtyEight]

23.2 percent
Percentage of songs in the Billboard Hot 100 in the 2010s that had a one-word title, an all-time high. [Priceonomics]

25 percent
Percentage of the 600,000 early voters in the Florida Republican primary who did not vote in GOP primaries in 2010, 2012 or 2014. Donald Trump’s performance has been strong among new voters, something that could hurt Marco Rubio substantially in next week’s primary. [The Wall Street Journal]

39 hours
Seven Democrats filibustered in Missouri’s Senate for 39 hours in an attempt to block a religious freedom bill that opponents say is anti-gay. The Republican majority voted to pass it. [The Washington Post]

40 percent
An analysis of 74 U.S. newspapers found that 40 percent of them published online mugshot galleries, a traffic and readership bonanza for the papers but a practice that raises ethical concerns and hits the accused where it hurts, in the Google search results. [Fusion]

150 times more likely
Several West Virginia lawmakers have fallen ill after taking a celebratory drink of unpasteurized milk after successfully passing a bill that allowed for the sale of unpasteurized milk. The CDC says unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely than normal milk to cause food-borne illnesses. [Daily Kos]

Number of delegates Marco Rubio obtained in the Mississippi and Michigan Republican primaries on Tuesday due to his failure to win at least 15 percent of the vote in those states. He also failed to win any delegates in Idaho. [ABC News]

3 to 8 percent
A study of 2 million European firms found that an additional woman in senior management or on the board of directors was associated with a higher return on assets of 3 percent to 8 percent. [Quartz]

45 percent
Percentage of mammals that are ugly, according to a new study out of Australia. Well, not exactly: The research sorted species into three categories — “good,” “bad” and “ugly” — and found that adorable animals (“good”) were the subjects of disproportionately more academic research than invasive species (“bad”) or gross-looking, janky, phoned-in, busted-up animals (I’m using the scientific jargon, but, more succinctly, the “ugly” ones). Of the animals inventoried, 45 percent fell into the latter category. [The Telegraph]

50 percent
Massive upset in Michigan: While every poll had Hillary Clinton in the lead in the Democratic race, with several indicating she was well ahead, Bernie Sanders won the Michigan primary instead, with 50 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 48 percent. This is far and away one of the largest upsets in primary polling history. [FiveThirtyEight]

91 percent
Percentage of millennials who use a phone to make a purchase at least once a month, according to a market research firm. Churches appear to be interested in tapping into this behavior, and a new app — named Tithe.ly, of course — lets people use their phones to cough up for the collection tray. [Bloomberg]

$200,000
The FBI alleges that a man who worked for the armored transport company Brink’s stole $200,000 in quarters from the Atlanta Fed over the course of nearly two months. [The Wall Street Journal]

13 percent
This could get rough: According to a Monmouth University poll in Michigan ahead of Tuesday’s primary vote, Marco Rubio is way behind in the Republican race with 13 percent support. The poll of likely GOP voters shows Donald Trump with 36 percent support and Ted Cruz with 23 percent. John Kasich of all people has 21 percent.

$13-13.50 per hour
Costco, the world’s second-largest retailer, announced plans to increase its starting wage from $11.50 to $12.00 per hour to $13 to 13.50 per hour, the first bump since 2007. [Business Finance News]

92 percent
Probability of Donald Trump winning the Michigan Republican primary, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus forecast. That chance is 97 percent in our polls-only forecast. [FiveThirtyEight]

$45,000
Opening bid for the chair that J.K Rowling sat in to write the first two books of the Harry Potter series. The chair is up for auction next month and will presumably sell for more. But it will never stop being weird that the chair where Rowling wrote two of her worst books is worth enough to feed a family of four for a year. [ABC News]

$450 million
Apple will pay a $450 million settlement in an antitrust suit after the Supreme Court declined to hear its appeal. The Justice Department and 30 states had sued Apple over alleged collusion with publishers to crank up the price of ebooks. [Bloomberg]

$4.5 billion
Amount invested in third-party off-campus housing last year. For developers trying to insulate themselves from real estate cycles, student housing has proved a prudent investment. Still, as a College of William & Mary graduate, I can’t really understand the appeal, given that the value of the real estate in Williamsburg, Virginia, is predicated on the idea that “George Washington Slept Here,” “Thomas Jefferson urinated here, allegedly” or “James Madison got turned down for a second date here.” [Bloomberg]

2 contests
Marco Rubio, the Republican establishment choice, has now won two of the 20 contests the GOP has held in states and territories to select its presidential nominee. He won the Minnesota caucus last week and had a big win in Puerto Rico on Sunday. But it’s looking increasingly difficult for Rubio to win an outright majority of delegates to score the nomination given the results so far and the state of the campaign in upcoming states. [The Washington Post]

7 months
After announcing a melanoma diagnosis seven months ago, former President Jimmy Carter says he no longer needs treatment for the cancer. Doctors will continue to monitor his health, but he’s looking good, and can get back to single-mindedly annihilating an ancient plague from this earth with the incandescent fury of a man seeking to accomplish one last thing before he is greeted by a then-wounded Death. [ABC News]

10 to 50 microwatts
Researchers at the University of Washington are working on new Wi-Fi hardware that consumes power at a vastly lower rate than current technology — something on the order of 10,000 times less power than typical Wi-Fi equipment. [Wired]

17 seasons
Peyton Manning is expected to announce his retirement today after 17 seasons in professional football. Manning is an undisputed shoo-in for the Hall of Fame; indeed, looking at the stats from just half of the years he played shows a career good enough on paper for the Hall of Fame. [FiveThirtyEight]

55 delegates
Bernie Sanders had a good weekend, winning the Democratic contests in Nebraska (57 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 43 percent) and Kansas (68 percent to Clinton’s 32 percent). Still, Clinton will walk away with more delegates from the “super Saturday” contests after routing Sanders in Louisiana. [NPR]

447 crossword puzzles
A group of crossword enthusiasts believe they have found a plagiarist in their midst: Since 1999, hundreds of puzzles distributed by Universal Crossword and printed in USA Today have looked suspiciously like puzzles first printed elsewhere. For example, 65 puzzles appear to have lifted their themes directly from New York Times puzzles. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1,262
According to a local man who tried it, that’s how much it costs for a New York City resident to eat Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s absurd diet — which involves 2.3 pounds of cod per day, plus chicken, vegetables, eggs and steak — for a month. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1 million
How much the average Arby’s restaurant makes in a year. That’s a new record for a brand once reviled for its disgusting sandwiches that remains reviled for it disgusting sandwiches but somehow sells far more of them, judging by consistent sales growth over the past five years. [BuzzFeed]

$3 billion
Louisiana is in pretty dire fiscal straits: The state is short about $3 billion to cover services over the next 16 months, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has given the GOP-controlled legislature a deadline to figure out a way to keep the state afloat. [The Washington Post]

43 percent
On Monday night, Dallas defeated Washington in a game that started with 58 minutes of boring and ended with a two-minute display of great and terrible football. Still, this means we need to talk about the NFC East, a wide-open division where every team has a losing record. It could produce a 6-10 playoff team. The Cowboys are 4-8, while Philadelphia, Washington and the Giants are each 5-7. One of these teams, in four weeks, will advance to the playoffs. FiveThirtyEight’s NFL Elo model currently gives Philly a 43 percent chance of going to the postseason, New York a 28 percent chance, Washington a 19 percent chance and Dallas a 10 percent chance. As a Giants fan, I’ll take those odds, but this division is the football equivalent of a cigarette butt somehow still smoldering in a puddle of horse pee on 59th Street on a humid New York day. [FiveThirtyEight]

45 percent
The El Niño cycle has all sorts of effects on agriculture, but its impact on one crop in particular may hit America’s insatiable sweet tooth by next year. Sugar prices are up 45 percent since August as droughts in India and Thailand and rain in Brazil ravage the supply. Demand for sugar is soon expected to exceed supply, so make like those kids from “Heavy Weights” and assemble your stockpile now, America. [Bloomberg]

49 percent
Percentage of Republicans who oppose a religious test for Syrian refugees to come to the U.S., according to a Fox News poll. On Monday, Donald Trump floated the idea of banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., which is probably unconstitutional, definitely extreme, and honestly just kind of terrifying coming from the leading candidate from a major American political party. [FiveThirtyEight]

57 percent
Percentage of Republican caucus-goers in Iowa who identified as born-again or evangelical Christians in 2012. This group has a complex relationship with the Republican Party, to say the least, but one potential bit of good news for the mainstream GOP is that they could serve as a willing firewall against an early Trump win in Iowa. [FiveThirtyEight]

$232
That’s the average American’s yearly legal expenses. Given how much legal services typically cost, Americans don’t really fight the small stuff: Only 5 percent of traffic tickets go to court, for example. A suite of legal apps are out to change that. [Bloomberg]

253
That’s where the Beijing municipal air-quality index stood on Monday. Anything over 200 is considered “very unhealthy” in the U.S., and Beijing has issued its first-ever air quality red alert, meaning schools are closed, car travel is restricted and barbecuing is banned. [The New York Times]

$500 per day
An Ohio couple has built a zombie-themed Nativity scene for the second year in a row, and some of their neighbors are not happy. The couple has been threatened with a fine of $500 per day by local zoning officials if they keep it up, but so far they haven’t heard anything since the deadline. Honestly, knowing how that whole saga ends, if you ask me, this isn’t blasphemy so much as heavy-handed foreshadowing. [The New York Times]

12,500 seats
Brazil’s problems getting ready to host the 2016 Summer Olympics continue: Because of a last-minute construction change, the Olympics Aquatic Stadium will have to shed 1,250 seats, dropping its capacity to 12,500 people. The stadium’s construction is already about $2.8 million over its budget, and losing the seats will cost about the same amount in lost ticket revenue. [SwimSwam]

15,000 tons
The U.S. Navy’s largest destroyer ever launched for sea trials on Monday. The USS Zumwalt is 600 feet long, weighs 15,000 tons, and cost a cool $4.4 billion. There were originally 32 ships planned in the Zumwalt’s class, but only three will be built thanks to cost overruns and a change in plans. Still, the story about the launch reports that the ship’s skipper is named Capt. James Kirk, so I assume the USS Zumwalt will explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, boldly go where no man has gone before. [The Associated Press]

1.4 million people
Food deserts — areas without supermarkets where fresh, healthy food is scarce — were a major target of first lady Michelle Obama’s nutrition initiatives. Still, in the past four years, only 1.4 million of the 18 million people living in a food desert got a new supermarket. [The Associated Press]

0 cancer
Yeah, I’m kind of stretching the concept of a digit here, but former U.S. president Jimmy Carter is cancer free. Carter, who announced in August that he had four melanoma lesions on his brain, said Sunday that those were gone and that there were no signs of new ones. [Atlanta Journal-Constitution]

1.5 extra years
Having a bunch of books in your home can be huge for kids: A study of 15-year-olds in 42 countries found that — outside of gross national product — the number of books in a home was the best predictor of reading proficiency. “The greatest effect was seen in libraries of about 100 books, which resulted in approximately 1.5 extra years of grade-level reading performance.” [The New York Times]

12-0
The Carolina Panthers beat the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, making the Panthers 12-0 and the first team in the league to clinch a playoff bid. In other good news, the Pats lost. In bad news, it was Philadelphia who beat them. [ESPN]

13 months
The U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will reportedly investigate the Chicago Police Department and the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. It took 13 months, and a judge’s order, before video of the killing was released. [The Chicago Sun-Times]

52.3 percent
The Kepler telescope has been trawling the skies for planets that exist outside our own solar system, but a new survey of the data found that about 52 percent of the identified planets may have been false positives. [Science World Report]

78 percent
Probability that a straight woman’s first marriage will last at least 20 years, provided she has a bachelor’s degree. Compare that with a 40 percent probability for women who have finished only high school, or less. [Pew Research Center]

99 percent
The Cavendish banana constitutes about 99 percent of the global banana market, but it wasn’t always so. The Cavendish replaced the Gros Michel, which was wiped out by a disease about 50 years. Now, it’s happening again, with planters powerless to stem Tropical Race 4, a powerful and deadly disease killing Cavendish populations worldwide. Too carby anyway if you ask me. [The Washington Post]

1,367 men
Number of men who suffered a genital injury from 2001 through 2013 as part of military service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Within a year, surgeons at Johns Hopkins University will attempt the first penis transplant in the U.S. on one such wounded soldier. [The New York Times]

$7,917.15
A Freedom of Information Act request from student journalist Chris Robbins in Michigan — asking which websites were blocked on his school’s computers — resulted in a fee of $7,917.15. After Robbins appealed the price, the school district responded with a bill of $8,806. The student later submitted a simpler request. [The Detroit News]

$100,000
MIT researchers have hacked the Microsoft Kinect to do fluorescence lifetime imaging, a medical technique “that could be useful for cancer diagnosis and DNA sequencing.” Your basic Kinect sells for about $100. The standard imaging device usually goes for $100,000. [Fast Company]

An attorney who wrote a book called “The Drinker’s Guide to Driving: The Secrets of DUI from One of America’s Top DUI Lawyers” was arrested for drunk driving Sunday, with a blood alcohol level of 0.12. Yes, it did happen in Florida — excellent guess. [The Herald Tribune]

2nd-longest
After his team trailed all night against the Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard game-ending Hail Mary pass for a touchdown with no time on the clock. The pass was the second-longest come-from-behind game-ending touchdown ever, and from a distance where such passes have a terrible completion rate. It was the worst thing to happen to the city of Detroit since globalization and systemic mismanagement. [ESPN Stats & Info, Brian Burke]

Elvira Montes, an 81-year-old grandmother, was the oldest finisher in this year’s Beer Mile World Championships, finishing four beers and running 1 mile in 20 minutes, 24 seconds. She is what we in the business call a “role model.” We should all be so lucky reach age 81, let alone sustain a reliable competitive drinking habit. [Runner’s World]

The other shoe has dropped, people, and it is feigning catastrophic injury in order to procure a yellow card as we speak. U.S. prosecutors announced a 92-count indictment against 16 FIFA officials yesterday, following up on a raid of a Swiss hotel where several officials were staying. [CNN] 

95.7 degrees Fahrenheit
A spokesperson for the upcoming Olympic Games said that organizers did not consider it critical to pay for air conditioning in athletes’ quarters in Rio de Janeiro and that someone else will have to handle the costs. Keep in mind that this year, Aug. 19, which would be towards the end of the events this coming year, hit 95.7 degrees in Rio. [ESPN]

589 reporters
In 2014, the number of reporters from niche outlets accredited by the U.S. Senate press gallery exceeded the number of reporters from daily newspapers. As someone from a niche outlet, I guess this is cool? Go niche outlets! [Pew Research Center]

220,000 jobs
Ashton Carter, whose name makes him sound like he is a member of One Direction but who is actually America’s secretary of defense, announced yesterday that the U.S. military will open all combat jobs to women. About 220,000 such jobs within the armed forces had been closed to women. [The Washington Post]

$5 million
That’s the amount brilliant negotiator and world-renowned dealmaker Donald Trump wanted CNN to donate to charity to ensure his participation in an upcoming presidential debate. CNN declined, but the legendary businessman and genius arbitrator, who as we all know could strike an absolutely flawless deal with anyone, especially the Chinese, relented and decided to participate in the debate anyway, because the negotiating strategy of “giving up when your primary request isn’t met” is just a tactic from page one of “The Art of the Deal,” a book Trump definitely wrote all by himself. [The Washington Post]

$117 million
Amount raised on Giving Tuesday, another manufactured holiday trying to chew the crumbs left over by the capitalist orgy that is Black Friday, albeit for charity. This is frankly encouraging, because I personally had a lot of trouble getting into the Small Business Saturday spirit this year. [NBC News]

NATO announced Wednesday it will invite Montenegro, a nation of roughly 600,000, to join its ranks, a move that’s delighting Montenegrins, infuriating Russians, and confusing Americans who are just learning that there is a country called Montenegro. Welcome to NATO, Montenegro, we hope you enjoy the North Atlantic trade. [The New York Times]

The story is developing this morning, but there was another raid on FIFA officials who were staying in a Swiss hotel! Authorities anticipate more than a dozen people connected to international soccer’s governing body will be charged with corruption-related crimes. [The New York Times]

15-minute drive
Kevin Wells, an English photographer, gave Public Enemy’s Flavor Flav, Chuck D and others a crucial lift to a gig in Sheffield in his Ford Focus when the rappers’ cab left without them. The 15-minute drive not only got the band to the venue in time but also produced probably the end-all dinner party story for Wells. [NPR]

A study published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, in 32 percent of men who had participated in contact sports in their youth. In the control group, no one had signs of the disease. [Yahoo News]

55.5 percent
Response rate to a labor force survey in the U.K., down from 76.5 percent in 2003. As a guy who pays his rent by doing stuff with numbers, I really can’t emphasize enough how crucial it is that people tell pollsters what they think. If you don’t, we won’t get a reliable picture of society — a concern U.K. statisticians are trying to get out in the open. [The Wall Street Journal]

Hillary Clinton expanded her lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in a new Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, taking 60 percent of Democratic support to Sanders’s 30 percent, compared to a 53/35 breakdown in early November. [Quinnipiac]

351 mass shootings
According to the crowdsourced Mass Shootings Tracker project, that’s how many U.S. incidents where four or more people were injured or killed in a shooting this year as of Nov. 27. That’s up from 2014, and up since last week following a shooting Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, that left at least 14 people dead. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,000 convictions
According to leaked documents, since the 1990s police officers in Alabama related to a neo-confederate group have been planting drugs on black men. About 1,000 wrongful convictions have resulted, according to the documents from the Alabama Justice Project. [Henry County Report via The Week]

1,100 dinosaurs
A museum 300 miles away from Beijing has amassed the world’s largest dinosaur collection, a noble goal if there ever was one. The Tianyu Museum of Nature has about 1,100 dinosaur fossils, which are the next-coolest thing to actual dinosaurs, which are the coolest thing. [The New York Times]

185,345 background checks
People went out to buy lots and lots of guns on Black Friday. The FBI reported running 185,345 background checks for gun sales on the Friday after Thanksgiving.

1 teaspoon
New York City became the first city in the country to mandate that chain restaurants label dishes that contain more than one teaspoon of salt, the recommended daily allowance. Given that I learned the difference between a teaspoon and a tablespoon only a few months ago (weird batch of brownies, for more than one reason) today, for the very first time, I am now in favor of the metric system, because the equivalent 2.3 grams of salt is something I can wrap my head around.

5 minutes, 31 seconds, 22 frames
Have you watched the trailers for “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”? If all the footage in those trailers actually appears in the film, fans have seen just more than 5 minutes, 31 seconds of the movie, or roughly 4 percent should the advertised 2 hour, 16 minute run time hold. [Eleven-ThirtyEight]

The level of support for Trump in live-interview polls — the kind we’ve relied on for decades — is averaging 23.4 percent, while the support for Trump in online polls — arguably the future of the field, provided those who run them can match the accuracy of their landline predecessors — is at 29.1 percent. That’s a 5.7-point difference, which is a pretty big deal. When we get a chance to see how these different methodologies play out, depending on Trump’s actual degree of support, we could get a good look at the future of polling. [FiveThirtyEight]

16 measures
Number of abortion and family planning measures John Kasich has signed since becoming governor of Ohio in 2011. Abortions in Ohio have fallen 25 percent during his tenure. While he hasn’t yet bragged about it on the campaign trail, Kasich has one of the most demonstrable anti-abortion records of anyone in the GOP field. [FiveThirtyEight]

10.3 percent
Percentage of U.S. women who used an IUD in 2012, up from 2 percent in 2002. Intra-uterine devices, which prevent pregnancy, are the new focus of a legal campaign against the Affordable Care Act from from anti-abortion groups, which argue that in rare cases IUDs could prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. [Reuters]

19 percent
Estimated percentage of donors to the 2003 gubernatorial campaign of now-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, an Indian-American, who were South Asian-Americans. That number declined over the course of Jindal’s subsequent campaigns. In his recently ended national bid for the presidency, Jindal presented a particularly notable case where, after a certain point, minority candidates fail to garner support among fellow minorities. [FiveThirtyEight]

42 percent
People might be naming their offspring after Instagram filters. “Ludwig” as a name was up 42 percent last year according to BabyCenter, a parenting website, while “Juno” was up 30 percent and “Amaro” was up 26 percent. All right, all of a sudden I understand what that friend with the kid named Lo-fi Jenkins was going for. [Re/code]

51 turtles
A man who attempted to cross the border to Canada with 51 turtles taped to his body pleaded guilty to smuggling charges. Let he among us who hasn’t been there throw the first stone. [Associated Press]

4,200 hours
Photographer Alan McFadyen spent 4,200 hours — roughly 175 full days — over six years trying to get the perfect picture of a kingfisher diving for a fish just as its pointy beak broke the water. Needless to say, he totally nailed it. [Geekologie]

1.8 billion streams
Drake was the most-streamed artist of 2015 on Spotify, according to the company, with 1.8 billion streams. This was a good year for Canadian musicians, as Justin Bieber took the record for the most streams in a single day, with 36 million on Nov. 13. [Spotify News]

The Third Amendment to the Constitution — the one that bans the quartering of soldiers in homes without the owner’s consent — is sort of the Pete Best of the early American legislative experiment. While the other amendments have had all sorts of play at the highest levels of legal rulings, there has never been a Supreme Court decision primarily based on the Third Amendment. Clearly the Founders had a goal, wrote it down, and we haven’t had too many questions about the matter since. Nice work, Founders. Anyway, there’s an idea bubbling among legal theorists to use the Third Amendment to counteract domestic spying from the NSA — a branch of the Department of Defense — and while it may not be 100 percent there, it’s interesting. [Ars Technica]

7 counts
Former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who was accused of receiving $4 million in kickbacks, was found guilty on all seven counts against him Monday, including four counts of fraud, two counts of extortion and one count of money laundering. [DNAinfo]

12th-best team
The Carolina Panthers are doing really, really well this year, with an undefeated record of 11-0. But they are — based on FiveThirtyEight’s NFL Elo model — in 12th place in a ranking of the 12 teams to ever go 11-0. Essentially this means what Panthers followers already know: Early in the season, the team won several close games. But hey, the top 11-0 team ever was the 2007 New England Patriots, and we all remember how that went down.1 [FiveThirtyEight]

15 years
George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars and now a private citizen who has not been allowed anywhere near the new Star Wars movie, has not used the Internet in the past 15 years. I wonder what online Menace could have possibly appeared in the year 2000 to drive him offline. [The Washington Post]
Full disclosure: Disney owns Star Wars and also owns ESPN, ESPN owns FiveThirtyEight, FiveThirtyEight pays Walter, I am Walter. I also like Star Wars a lot, but on my own time. 

$35
AT&T subscribers who have managed to hold on tightly to their grandfathered $30-per-month unlimited data plans will see a $5 price increase in February. [9to5Mac]

63 percent
New York tweaked its statewide Algebra I exam to make it harder to pass. Well guess what, it’s totally working. Only 63 percent of students passed the exam this year, compared to 72 percent last year. [The New York Times]

65 percent
A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (which sounds like a shadowy pseudo-governmental agency that tries to kill James Bond but really just works with HR people) found only 65 percent of surveyed companies will have a holiday party for employees this year, down from 83 percent in the halcyon days of 1998. [Bloomberg]

600,000 elevators
The world’s biggest elevator market is in China, but as the rate of people moving to its big cities slows and a glut of existing housing remains, demand for elevators is expected to drop. Otis Elevator, the biggest manufacturer of elevators in the world, estimated that Chinese sales will decrease from the 600,000 units sold last year to about 500,000 next year. [Bloomberg]

18 million
While the final numbers won’t be out until next year, Wall Street analysts are estimating 18 million new vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2015, the most ever. The current record-holder is 2000, when 17.6 million vehicles were sold. [Business Insider]

33 million
Estimate of the number of visitors to Rome for the upcoming Jubilee of Mercy, a nearly yearlong Roman Catholic event, up from the city’s annual average of 13 million visitors. To protect these tourists, Rome has banned the people dressed as Roman Centurions who hang around the city posing for pictures or pulling rickshaws. The city believes the historical interpreters are a nuisance. This is worse than the time Colonial Williamsburg removed a historical hemp farmer interpreter, though in retrospect he may have just been a guy trying to sell weed to William & Mary students. [Smithsonian Magazine]

Exciting news! For the next two weeks, as global powers meet in Paris to negotiate responses to climate change, we’ll be publishing a climate-focused Significant Digits offshoot, written by the hella rad Christie Aschwanden. Check out the first edition.

1 team
With New England’s loss to Denver 30-24 in overtime Sunday, the Carolina Panthers are the NFL’s only remaining undefeated team following (most of) Week 12. We still give the Patriots the highest chance of winning the Super Bowl. [ESPN]

20 seasons
Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant announced — in a poem! — that this NBA season, his 20th, will be his last. Bryant has been injured often recently, playing in just 41 of 164 games the last two seasons. [The New York Times]

32 countries
Japan is trying to figure out how to handle a population that is increasingly elderly, with a huge bearing on the rest of the world: By 2050, 32 countries will have a population with a greater share of senior citizens than Japan does today, according to the United Nations. [The Wall Street Journal]

41 percent
The probability Oklahoma will win college football’s national title, according to FiveThirtyEight’s model. The Sooners won the Big 12 championship over weekend. [FiveThirtyEight]

$100,000
Estimate for how much the department store Kohl’s will pay to use a cover of the Beatles song “All Together Now” in a national ad campaign of 15- to 30-second spots. The band’s iconic oeuvre is far from cheap, and securing song rights can take months of negotiation. But by using a cover artist for the song instead of the original recording, the advertising firm Kohl’s hired was able to roughly halve the cost. [The New York Times]

200,000 views
A convicted Czech pirate — to be more specific here, the kind of pirate who uploads movies or software he isn’t supposed to, not the kind of pirate who attacks boats and pillages — got software firms to agree not to sue him if he made an anti-piracy video and got 200,000 views for it within two months. The man succeeded in this endeavor, with more than 400,000 views so far, and now does not have to pay a lot of money to very angry multinational corporations. [BBC]

3.38 million
U.S. opening week sales for Adele’s new album, “25,” the first to sell more than 3 million copies in a week in Nielsen’s history of monitoring sales. [Billboard]

4.8 million
A breach has compromised 4.8 million records of Hong Kong-based toy company VTech, potentially exposing customer account data to hackers. User passwords were encrypted using a crappy MD5 hash, and what’s worse, hackers can use the data to easily make connections between accounts for parents and their children. It all sounds like catnip for a fear-mongering local news broadcast near you. [Troy Hunt via Ars Technica]

$20 billion
Climate change talks begin in Paris today, with some early news bolstering confidence in a potential agreement: The U.S. and 18 other countries will double investment in clean energy to $20 billion, according to the White House. The measure has the support of technology and business leaders as well. [The Guardian]

??? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ???
We’re going for an unconventional digit today. Here is typically where we’d discuss the sales numbers coming out of Black Friday, and how [good/bad] they are and the [exciting/deleterious] effect that might have on holiday spending, which in turn could have an [unspeakable/Lovecraftian] impact on overall consumer spending. But my colleague Ben Casselman set me straight: All the numbers you’re reading about Black Friday sales are unreliable and often useless. [FiveThirtyEight]

You’re reading a very special Thanksgiving edition of Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.
1.2 times as high
Increase in foot traffic in department stores on Black Friday, according to a Google analysis of its users’ location history from Nov. 1 though Dec. 25 last year. Electronics stores see a massive jump on the national day of commercialism, with 2.3 times as many people passing through. [Think With Google]

4 years
Amount of time it took for Thanksgiving to no longer be a holiday for retail workers. In 2011, it was considered absurd when stores like Target, Macy’s, Best Buy, and Kohl’s tried out “Black Midnight,” opening their doors right after Thanksgiving ended. Now it’s rare to find major retailers that aren’t open with deals on Thanksgiving proper. [BuzzFeed]

7 minutes
Flying to Thanksgiving dinner this year? If you’re flying on Spirit, you can expect an average of nine minutes added to the flight relative to other airlines, while if you’re on Virgin your flight is typically seven minutes faster than other airlines. [FiveThirtyEight]

11 percent
Support among Republicans for an executive action issued by President Obama pardoning two turkeys last Thanksgiving, rather than the usual one. 38 percent of GOP respondents to the Public Policy Polling survey opposed the choice. In fairness, that turkey did all those murders and swore he’d kill again, so the argument for the additional pardon is understandably fraught. [PPP Polls]

20 percent
Percentage of respondents to a survey about Thanksgiving dinner who said they had mac and cheese on the table. But that’s not consistent across the country. Thanksgiving sides are regionally specific: About 35 percent of Southerners who took the survey said they’d have macaroni and cheese on the meal, with similar disproportionate preferences for squash in New England, cornbread in the central south, and, believe it or not, salad on the west coast. [FiveThirtyEight]

$50.11
According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, that’s the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 in the year 2015, up 70 cents from 2014. [Las Vegas Review Journal]

83 percent
As for the football on Thanksgiving, the FiveThirtyEight model says the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles game is a coin flip — the Lions have a win probability of 52 percent. As the day goes on, the pre-game probabilities get a little more lopsided: Carolina is forecasted to beat Dallas 65 percent of the time, and Green Bay should beat Chicago 83 percent of the time. [FiveThirtyEight]

$805
Forecast of the average per-shopper holiday spending this year, according to the National Retail Federation. It forecasts $630.5 billion to be spent this year, up 3.7 percent from 2014. Still, this doesn’t mean that Black Friday rules anymore: consumer spending, once isolated on the day after Thanksgiving, has become more distributed. [The Dallas Morning News]

10,000 calls
On Thanksgiving day last year the Butterball turkey prep hotline fielded more than 10,000 calls. [The Guardian]

Over 6 million
Estimated population of North American wild turkeys, up from a low of somewhere between 30,000 to 200,000 at the lowest level in the 1920s and 1930s. [New Scientist]

2 holdouts
With Nicaragua reportedly set to join the Paris climate accords — they held out in 2015 because the nation believed the deal didn’t go far enough — there are now only two holdouts from the landmark deal: Syria and the United States, which President Trump said would pull out of the agreement. [Bloomberg]

AB 485
A California bill awaiting the signature of Gov. Jerry Brown would outlaw puppy mills, banning pet stores from selling cats, dogs and bunnies that did not come from a shelter or rescue. [The New York Times]

1,772 episodes
This is easily the most staggering statistic I have come across while writing this column: There have been 1,772 individual episodes of HGTV’s “House Hunters” since it debuted in 1999. I could watch an episode of “House Hunters” every day for nearly five years without seeing a single repeat. When we’re just a radioactive cinder in the gaze of an expanding sun, whomever or whatever succeeds us will be able to say, “damn … they were good at finding and obtaining houses.” [Vulture]

80,000 311 calls
Hurricane Sandy left an indelible mark on New York City, and the effects of the storm can still be seen and felt years later. More than 36 million calls were placed to NYC’s 311 service from just before Sandy hit in late 2012 through earlier this week. Nearly 80,000 of them were related to the storm. And the tail is super long — 142 such calls were made in 2017 (as of Monday). [FiveThirtyEight]

3.5 million people
Hurricane Maria has left the entire island of Puerto Rico and its 3.5 million residents without power. That’s to say nothing of flooding and other destruction. Maria, now a Category 3 storm, is currently hitting the Dominican Republic. [BBC]

$31.4 million
Russian trade with North Korea more doubled to $31.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Reuters found eight North Korean fuel ships that left Russia ostensibly en route to China or South Korea only to change their final destination to North Korea. [Reuters]

8.1 percent
A storied Boston-area financial institution announced “disappointing” profit numbers for the latest fiscal year, with the $37.1 billion fund pulling in only an 8.1 percent return. (For perspective, the S&P 500 posted about a 13 percent return for the last year.) This comes months after the financial firm, which uses the proceeds from its ample endowments to sponsor a local university named “Harvard,” announced layoffs and more investment outsourcing. [FastFT]

$18,764
Average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health insurance coverage, according to the 2017 edition of the Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employee health benefits. Workers paid, on average, $5,714 of that. Premiums were up 3 percent compared to 2016. [Kaiser Family Foundation]

$231,250
The Republican National Committee is helping to pay President Trump’s legal bills in relation to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the potential involvement of Trump associates. The RNC confirmed that it paid $100,000 to Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, and $131,250 to the Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, where another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is a partner. [Reuters]

299,649 Twitter accounts
Number of user accounts Twitter removed in the first half of 2017 for “promotion of terrorism.” While high, that’s still down 20 percent from the previous six months. [Reuters]

$60 million
Patreon, the site that lets fans set up recurring payments to independent creators, just closed a $60 million funding round. [Variety]

$45 billion
The GOP’s earlier attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act carried with it $45 billion in additional funding to help with opioid addiction treatment. The money was meant to compensate for cuts the repeal bill made to Medicaid. But the latest GOP effort to repeal Obamacare, Graham-Cassidy, doesn’t contain funding to combat the opioid epidemic. It’s not clear why some Republican senators were demanding the funding before but not now. [The Daily Beast]

14 quarterbacks
Colin Kaepernick is a historical anomaly. There have been only 14 other quarterbacks who were (i) not yet 30, (ii) had thrown 200 passes or more in a season and (iii) never played again. And everyone in that group had football-related reasons they never took another snap — career ending injuries, substance abuse issues, got signed but never left the bench — rather than politics. [ESPN]

16 investigators
There are now 16 lawyers known to be working on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Kyle Freeny is No. 16. She left a high-profile money laundering case at the Department of Justice to join Team Mueller. [POLITICO]

-18 percentage points
President Trump’s job approval rating is down by 18 percentage points, on average, compared to his margin of victory in states he won by 10 or more points in 2016. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.8 million
Equifax’s share price has dropped 35 percent since the company announced a security breach that exposed data on 143 million Americans. Before the breach was publicly announced (and after it was discovered), three Equifax executives sold $1.8 million worth of stock. Now the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into whether the executives broke insider trading laws. [Bloomberg]

$60 million
Amount “It,” the movie adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, made last weekend. That would have been the best-ever September weekend at the domestic box office — except for the fact that it was the second weekend in cinemas for “It.” The movie notched a record-smashing $123 million opening the week before. So “It” now has the best weekend in September, the second best weekend in September, and then previous record-holder “Hotel Transylvania 2” is down in third place. [The Numbers]

$2.3 billion
Ballpark cost for the M7, a luxury submarine. Yes, rich people can totally buy submarines. No, I didn’t think that was legal either, but it’s legit. The M7 comes in at the shall-we-say high end of the luxury submarine market, as in “the most expensive private object worldwide” high-end. Too pricy? If you want something classier then a James-Cameron-class submersible but short of the M7, other sizable subs may soon be on sale that will appeal to the more price-conscious Nemo-wannabe in your life.

8 Emmys
Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her eighth primetime acting Emmy award on Sunday night, which ties the career record set by Cloris Leachman. Besides “Veep,” the other big winners last night included “Saturday Night Live,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Big Little Lies.” [The New York Times]

18 percent
Obesity rate in Brazil in 2015, up from 7 percent in 1980. One effect of globalization is that the same processed foods, sugary drinks and poor nutrition habits that made America obese have now been efficiently exported to the rest of the world. [The New York Times]

22 floods
The federal flood insurance program has paid more than $1.8 million between 1979 and 2015 to rebuild a single house in Kingwood, Texas. The house has been flooded 22 times since 1979, but Hurricane Harvey was the last straw — the homeowner wants out. [The Wall Street Journal]

10,000 snaps
Congratulations to Joe Thomas of the Cleveland Browns, who on Sunday played his 10,000th consecutive snap since being drafted in 2007. The left tackle has never missed a play in an NFL game. [ESPN]

10,046 runners
Of the 28,206 runners who officially crossed the finish line in the Mexico City Marathon, 10,046 missed at least one of the eight timing mats around the course. (Nearly 300 missed all eight!) Widespread evidence of runners skipping portions of the course and other shenanigans has led to the disqualification of more than 5,800 people, which is legitimately absurd. [Runner’s World]

$25 million
Amount reportedly spent on President Trump’s pre-inauguration Lincoln Memorial concert — a tad more than the $5 million spent on Obama’s inauguration concert or the $2.5 million spent on George W. Bush’s. Toby Keith and Three Doors Down must be pricy. [Associated Press]

85 percent
An abnormally warm winter caused the loss of 85 percent of Georgia’s peach crop. As world temperatures rise due to climate change, crops all over — whether it’s apples in Michigan or cherries in California — are at risk of loss due to premature blooms or dry winters. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,800 people
The entire island of Barbuda was evacuated ahead of Hurricane Irma, meaning the 62 square mile home of about 1,800 people is empty. It’s infrastructure has also been decimated by the storm, with about 95 percent of its structures sustaining damage. [USA Today]

3,948
Later today we’re going to hurl a satellite into Saturn. The Cassini-Huygens mission has been a major success, resulting in 3,948 scientific papers, 453,048 images taken, and six named moons discovered. You have any idea how hard it is to find a moon nobody else noticed? Yeah well Cassini did that like six times. Now it gets to be part of Saturn, which is pretty neat all things considered. [NASA]

700 million
New air conditioning units expected to be added by 2030, largely in developing countries. One issue yet to be solved is that additional air conditioning units are positively terrible for the environment, given that the hydroflourocarbons that they use as refrigerants have thousands of times the warming potential of more common greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. [The Verge]

$4.4 billion
Immigrating to the U.S. isn’t easy, but the rich have a leg up: The EB-5 visa allows investors to eventually obtain a green card with a $500,000 minimum investment in the U.S. In 2015, the value of those loans was $4.4 billion, up from $240 million in 2007, with 74 percent of that investment going to real estate. The great recession made foreign EB-5 related financing ideal for many real estate developers: They get a way better interest rate than commercial alternatives — 4 to 8 percent annually compared to 10 to 18 percent annually — because the actual ROI for the lender is a green card. [Bloomberg]

$58 billion
That’s the current estimate for the aggregate costs of Hurricane Irma in Florida, with a further $30 billion in damage to Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean. It’s important that Irma struck Marco Island rather than passing it 20 miles to the west, as the storm could have hit mainland Florida at a far more advanced strength and could have caused an additional $150 billion in damage to the state.

32 inches
Imagine a person on an airplane bracing for impact and assuming the position where their head is between their legs. Department of Transportation documentation indicates there has to be a 35 inch axis from the bottom of the seat back in order to have a clear head strike zone. According to a court briefing, the most generous axis in coach seats right now is 32 inches after years of cramming more seats on to planes, meaning no seat meets the standard in coach. [The Daily Beast]

44 minutes
Time spent on advertisements during the Raiders-Titans game on Sunday, a low for the weekend. Looking at the NFL opening weekend games in the aggregate, games had about 10 fewer minutes of commercials compared to last year. [Sports Facts]

46 percent
Percentage of NFL offenses that gained fewer than 300 yards in week one, up from 22 percent of offenses in the previous three season openers. This may underscore a league-wide problem developing offensive line talent. [The Washington Post]

$5,000
Martin Shkreli, the widely reviled pharmaceutical representative convinced of fraud, has had his $5 million bail revoked after he used his pre-sentencing time as a free man to put up a $5,000 bounty for one of his fans to grab former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s hair. This was considered bad behavior by the judge. [CNBC]

$25,000 per hour
Hourly cost of the U.S. Air Force jet that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, independently wealthy from his time at Goldman Sachs, asked the government to use to fly him to his honeymoon in Scotland, France and Italy. The request to have the taxpayers fund the vacation was declined. [ABC News]

$500,000
Minimum amount that Equifax spent on lobbying Congress and regulators in the first half of 2017, including pursuing legislation that would limit the liability of credit reporting companies in the courts. Given that Equifax oversaw the personal financial data of 143 million Americans that was hacked in a cyberattack, that sure would be a useful law to have on the books so they wouldn’t have to pay victims all that much.

3
Number of Week 1 NFL games decided by 7 points or fewer, the worst for any season-opener since 1973. It was a week seriously short on riveting games, but let’s be real: All you people who took a fantasy football flyer on Kareem Hunt because I mentioned him this past week must be pretty cool with your subscription to Significant Digits right now. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 hours
Hillary Clinton’s new book, “What Happened,” is out, and it’s entering the wildly varied political memoir market. Based on how long the average person actually listened to the audiobook, George W. Bush’s 20.2 hour-long “Decision Points” is the most stuck-with tome in the genre at 12.0 hours, beating Clinton’s own “Hard Choices,” which the average listener tuned into for 8.4 hours out of 27 hours in the book. [FiveThirtyEight]

25
Vitamin World filed for Chapter 11 relief on Monday, making it the 25th retail chain with over $10 million in liabilities to do so in 2017. [Reorg First Day]

38 percent
A survey of a panel of economists by the Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets found 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the rising use of A.I. and robots will lead to more long-term unemployment, compared with 21 percent who disagree and 29 percent who were uncertain. Those same economists agreed — 52 percent, and another 26 percent strongly agreeing on top of that — that the use of robots and A.I. will bring about economic benefits large enough to compensate those unemployed workers.

130 tons
Estimated weight of a fatberg — if you’re new to sewers, I’ll explain in a moment — stretching for 250 meters underneath London. Here’s the reality: When you pour things down the drain, they go through a convoluted series of pipes underground. Sometimes people pour down liquid fat that they cooked with, not understanding that oil will solidify long before reaching its final destination. Other people flush wet napkins down the toilet that do not disintegrate but instead form a horrifying solid paste with the aforementioned fats. Over the years, these aggregate into fatbergs — an amalgamation of fat with similar blocking effects of an iceberg — and take like three weeks to remove, as is anticipated in this case.

Once again, Olive Garden is selling pasta passes, which will allow cardholders to eat unlimited pasta, soup, salad and breadsticks at locations from Sept. 25 through Nov. 19 at no additional charge. The passes cost $100 this year in a first come, first served sale this Thursday at 2 p.m. Last year, Olive Garden sold 21,000 passes in one second. I picked the wrong month to quit eating carbs. [Business Insider]
CORRECTION (Sept. 13, 6:30 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly said Olive Garden sold 22,000 pasta passes last year. It sold 21,000.

11 percent
At the current pace, FBI National Instant Criminal Background Checks for firearm sales will be down 11 percent compared to last year. It’s an imperfect proxy, but across the industry the election of Donald Trump to the White House has suppressed the demand for weapons that usually accompanies even the slightest chance of gun reform. [Fortune]

25 percent
PETA made headlines recently when it bankrolled a lawsuit against a nature photographer, claiming that an Indonesian macaque monkey named Naruto owned the intellectual property rights on a selfie it had taken when it snagged the photographer’s camera in 2011. On Monday, PETA officially dropped the suit, but according to the terms of the settlement 25 percent of the gross revenue from the selfie will go to Naruto’s welfare and habitat. [Ars Technica]

39 square miles
Texas and other southern states are contending with a devastating invasive species annihilating bodies of water with overgrowth: giant salvinia. Australian researchers — a nation which itself is going toe-to-toe with the salvinia problem — found under ideal conditions even a pinch of salvinia plant can singlehandedly cover 39 square miles of water in 3 months. Locals have resorted to fighting the plant with its natural enemy, weevils. [Texas Monthly]

8.5 million barrels
The United Nations Security Council agreed to new sanctions against North Korea, limiting its imports of crude and refined oil to 8.5 million barrels a year and banning all exports of its textiles (worth $726 million last year), which now means about 90 percent of the North Korean exports are banned. [The Washington Post]

A recent report from Adobe’s digital price index found that if all offline retail spending was online, there would be an aggregate $2.2 billion savings for consumers. [Marketwatch]

$350 billion to $750 billion
Forthcoming investment in new lithium mines, as producers strive to keep up with explosive demand for the metal used in the rechargeable batteries that underpin the electric car market. Global electric vehicle sales are projected to exceed 24 million in just 13 years, up from 1 million in 2017. [Bloomberg]
CORRECTION (Sept. 19, 3:30 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described U.N. sanctions against North Korea. The sanctions allow North Korea to import up to 8.5 million barrels of crude and refined oil, not just crude.

Hurricane Irma is pummeling Florida, leaving about 2.7 million without power as of 5:30 p.m. yesterday. The storm is hitting Florida’s western coast where there are many assisted living facilities, many areas where a substantial percentage of people who live in mobile homes or below the poverty line, or where there are large concentrations of migrant workers.

[The Washington Post]

72 percent
The U.S. Asian population is growing faster than any other U.S. racial or ethnic group, climbing 72 percent between 2000 and 2015 according to a new study from the Pew Research Center. Asians Americans are projected to eclipse Hispanic Americans in 2055 to become the largest immigrant group in the country. [Pew Research Center]

450,000 people
The Houston area is only just reckoning with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Still 70,000 people are without water and another 380,000 need to boil water because their supply may have been compromised. While many residents do not have flood insurance and will soon have to rebuild their homes, FEMA officials said they will contribute a maximum of $33,000 per home. [Reuters]

$97 million
The cost in U.S. dollars of a plebiscite vote in Australia on a non-binding resolution that would change the country’s marriage laws to include same-sex marriage. The cost is just one reason that some question the point of a national vote when it will not have any effect, and Parliament can easily vote on the subject without needed to spur up a divisive and marginalizing political campaign.

16 weeks
Taylor Swift, a local 🐍 and pop musician, prevented “Despacito” from breaking the record for the longest reign at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 list. Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do” is the new chart-topper, deposing Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber’s single. Lacking a record, they’ll have to settle for a tie with Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, whose “One Sweet Day” was a top song for 16 weeks. [CNN]

77 percent
That’s the percentage of ratings on IMDb for the film “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power” that were either a 1 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10. It’s the most polarizing film of the year, and the fact that most of the votes trashing it came in before it even hit wide release is suspicious. [FiveThirtyEight]

25,000 vehicles
The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved legislation that forbids states from blocking self-driving cars and allows auto companies to put up to 25,000 automated vehicles on the road without meeting auto safety standards. [Reuters]

100,000 claims
Hurricane Irma-related insurance claims anticipated by the second-largest property insurer in Florida, Citizens Property Insurance Corp. For some perspective, Citizens only has 262,000 policyholders in areas that may see hurricane-force winds, so the damage from the major hurricane could be severe this coming weekend. [SunSentinel]

1 downed plane
NATO has called an “extraordinary meeting” after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border. Russia claims the plane was over Syrian airspace, but Turkey claims it had crossed the border into its territory. [The Washington Post]

4.90 seconds
Lucas Etter, age 14, is the first person to solve a Rubik’s cube in less than 5 seconds in a sanctioned competition. A few months ago I tried to learn how to solve a Rubik’s cube as a party trick, and I can basically get it down to the last part, but only after a couple of minutes. Lucas makes me look like a blind pirate when it comes to Rubik’s cubes. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 minutes, 5 seconds
Earlier this year, NBC rolled the dice. They let Donald Trump appear on “Saturday Night Live” for 12 minutes and 5 seconds, and the episode pulled in a huge viewership. But now NBC needs to offer equal time to candidates who are, shall we say, less of a draw. John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, and Lindsey Graham are all confirmed to appear later this week in some markets and on this weekend’s SNL. 12.08 minutes have also been allotted to human rounding error and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. [Variety]

Number of chlamydia cases in 2014, the highest number of cases on record, according to a new report Tuesday.

31 percent
A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll gives us a glimpse of an alternate timeline where Mitt Romney entered the 2016 presidential campaign. Thirty-one percent of New Hampshire voters say they would vote for Romney if he were magically on the ballot, which is probably really only helpful for people who can travel across the multiversal plane. [The Boston Globe]

47 to 86 percent
Red Lobster, a chain that serves ostensibly fulfilling seafood, will increase the size of the shrimp in its menu offerings by 47 to 86 percent, depending on the dish. The upgrade affects 70 percent of entrees. [BuzzFeed]

54 years old
Median age of an NPR listener this year, up from 45 in 1995. This trend is worrisome for people at the public radio organization and has led to efforts to recruit new on-air talent. [The Washington Post]

56.1 percent
With 100 percent of votes tallied, Democrat John Bel Edwards defeated Sen. David Vitter 56.1 percent to 43.9 percent Saturday in Louisiana’s gubernatorial election. A top issue of the campaign was Vitter’s alleged dalliances with prostitutes. Vitter also announced this weekend that he will not pursue re-election to the Senate when his term is up. [The Lens]

60 lawyers
Of the 83,963 people who took the bar exam to become attorneys last year, 60 of them skipped the traditional step of, you know, going to law school. It’s apparently allowed for a lawyer to become official by serving as an “apprentice” under a practicing attorney or a judge. According to last year’s results, 17 of the 60 apprentices who took the bar exam passed it. [Priceonomics]

1,111 carats
A massive diamond was found in a mine in Botswana last week. It’s been reported as 1,111 carats, which is helpful for people who know what carats are. I am not one of those people, so I looked it up, and a carat is 200 milligrams (0.2 grams), which is now in metric and thus still not super helpful for Americans. A 142-carat stone weighs an ounce, so we’re talking a half-pound diamond here. [Motherboard]

6,300 documents
About 6,300 census documents thought to have been destroyed after World War II were found in the walls of a Budapest apartment. They appear to be early records used in Nazi plans to send the 200,000 Jews of Budapest to death camps. [The Guardian]

$17.4 billion
A new report from Merrill Lynch projects the global personal robot market to be $17.4 billion in 2020. One major growth sector is robots that care for the infirm, which is especially promising in Japan, where an aging population means there is more demand for elder care than younger Japanese can supply. [Tech Insider]

$150 billion
In important-but-boring merger news, drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Allergan PLC have agreed on terms for a merger worth $150 billion. As a result, Pfizer will be able to be based in Ireland, where corporate taxes are less of a thing, rather than the U.S., where taxes are considered a rather important thing to pay, generally speaking.

A study at an all-you-can-eat pizzeria found that men who dined with women ate 93 percent more pizza than men who dined with other men — roughly one and a half more slices. This research, out of Cornell University, has inspired a brilliant television show pitch: I host a total and complete reshoot of every episode of “Man vs. Food,” except the entire rest of the cast and crew consists of women, propelling me to victory. Come at me, Food Network, you know this is gold. [Slate, Springer]

The House voted 289-137 Thursday to require FBI background checks and sign-offs from at least three U.S. officials before allowing Syrian and Iraqi refugees — you know, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free — into the country with refugee status. That vote margin is enough to override a threatened presidential veto. [Yahoo News]

$1,500-$1,800
LAX is set to open up a VIP terminal that will cost users $1,500 to $1,800 per trip. That fee will allow the patrons of the Los Angeles Suite to drastically cut the walk to the plane, enjoy its lounges, and identify themselves as enemies in the forthcoming class war. [The Guardian]

Wiretaps that may very well have been illegal have intercepted the text messages and calls of more than 52,000 people in the Riverside County area of California since mid-2013. Courts there were responsible for approving about a fifth of U.S. wiretaps in 2014. [USA Today]

$106,445.56
Joe Campbell, a trader, shorted a stock on E-Trade and got completely wiped out to the tune of $106,445.56. This led to one of the most craven but interesting GoFundMe pages seen in a very long time. Hey, at least he’s not some bigoted restaurateur. [MarketWatch]

$73 million
Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals was named the National League MVP Thursday after leading the league in wins above replacement.

192,000
Fox Business Network enjoyed a viewership boost after it hosted a Republican primary debate Tuesday, with 192,000 viewers during a business day Wednesday, about double its number from the day before. [Talking Biz News]

631,187
Number of students who were scheduled to take the Suneung in South Korea on Thursday. The nationwide exam has a substantial bearing on the academic future of Koreans planning to enter university. [The Korea Herald]

1 million
Approximate number of U.S. households that would be affected by a proposed Department of Housing and Urban Development rule that would ban smoking in public housing units. The change would affect a lot of people in New York, where 400,000 people live in 178,000 New York City Housing Authority apartments. [The New York Times]

526 million
Number of Spotify streams of “Lean On” by Major Lazer & DJ Snake, currently the most-streamed song in the service’s history. Given that New York is in a cold snap and I’m getting in that mood, I expect to single-handedly take “Let It Go” past that bar by Christmas. [The Guardian]

12 to 15 percent
Joe’s Crab Shack will experiment with ending tipping and paying employees more at some locations. The restaurant chain is testing increasing prices by 12 to 15 percent to account for the increased wages. [Eater]

39 light-years
MIT and Harvard researchers announced that they have detected a rocky planet orbiting a red dwarf star 39 light-years away. [The Boston Globe]

67 percent
Probability that Clemson University will make the College Football Playoff this year, the highest odds of any college, based on FiveThirtyEight’s prediction model. There’s also a 49 percent chance that Clemson will win out the rest of the season. [FiveThirtyEight]

70 percent
Just for some perspective on where the Democratic Party’s elected officials are lining up, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has 70 percent of all possible endorsement points according to FiveThirtyEight’s endorsement tracker, compared with the 19 percent she had locked in at the same time in the 2008 cycle. [FiveThirtyEight via Harry Enten]

$4,000
The city of Seattle paid $4,000 to have a horrifying yet somehow iconic chewing-gum-covered wall power-washed clean, with a million estimated wads of gum eradicated from the edifice. This is an important step forward for the city, one hopes, because when a major cultural attraction for your metropolis is a vermin-sustaining wall covered with used chewing gum, you run the risk of people starting to side with the fault line that will doom your city to geological annihilation. [Gizmodo]

14,000 calls
Phone records obtained from a hack of Securus Technologies, which provides phones to jails, found 14,000 recorded conversations between inmates and their lawyers, a potential breach of attorney-client confidentiality. [The Intercept]

4.8 million
Dr. Seuss is the juggernaut of children’s literature, still by far the most popular children’s author years after his death. There were 4.8 million books by Seuss sold in 2013, up from 3.2 million in 2010. Seuss created some of the most iconic characters of kids’ literature, including the Cat in the Hat, the Grinch, the Lorax, and the most nefarious interrogation of the moral malleability of the soul and the banality of evil to ever appear on the page, Max the Dog from “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Seriously, when you really consider the character of Max, you get to some dark places quick. Think about it. [Priceonomics]

50 million
The Kars 4 Kids radio commercial — you know the one I’m talking about — is heard by an estimated 50 million listeners daily. I wager that sentence alone is worth a thousand pledge drive weeks when it comes to recruiting sustaining members of National Public Radio. [Vice]

$720 million
Amount wagered on Major League Baseball in Nevada in 2014, up 6 percent from 2013. The MLB remains haunted by the ghost of Pete Rose — a man who, to my knowledge, is still alive, but you know what I mean — and wants to make sure that no players are cheating to get in on that action. As a result they’ve hired SportIM to monitor the league and identify suspicious gambling activity. It’s the kind of system Kenesaw Mountain Landis — who is definitely dead; I checked — must have dreamed of. [Bloomberg]

$14 billion
Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, claimed $1 billion in sales in the first eight minutes of Single’s Day, the Chinese equivalent of Black Friday. The International Data Corp. forecast that the company would book $14 billion in total sales. These numbers should probably be taken with a grain of salt, but with $9 billion in sales by midday, Alibaba had a huge performance on one of the biggest shopping days of the year. [CNET]

6 percent
Twitter is already gloating about the most recent stupid change to its UI, a switch from stars representing a “favorite” to hearts representing a “like.” Never before have I been pushed into an introspective period regarding my commitment issues by a user interface swap from a technology company, but that’s where we stood a week ago. Anyway, apparently people are using the button 6 percent more in the first week, but let’s see how this awful idea plays out in the long run. [BuzzFeed]

22 percent
Percentage of offices that provide free snacks and beverages, Nate. A 2011 study from Staples found that snack runs accumulated to 2.4 billion hours of lost productivity annually in the United States, Nate. [Bloomberg]

58 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe in the existence of a hell. Given this new data, we can conclude that at least 42 percent of Americans have never driven down that stretch of Interstate 95 between Washington and Fredericksburg. [Pew Research Center]

106 indictments
A grand jury handed down 106 indictments related to a biker brawl and shooting at a bar in Waco, Texas, in May. [WFAA]

200,000 emails
Comcast reset the passwords of 200,000 compromised customer email accounts after hackers obtained the passwords and offered them for sale. To add insult to injury, the act of clicking through and resetting the passwords, while ever so small, probably counted against the draconian data caps that Comcast has imposed on its customers. [CNET]

500,000
Approximate number of New York state residents who participate in daily fantasy sports, according to DraftKings. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday ordered DraftKings and FanDuel to stop accepting bets in the state because their games constituted illegal gambling. This makes me furious, but only because I bet a bunch of money that it would be U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara who would lay down the cease-and-desist on daily fantasy in New York, not Schneiderman, in my Daily Fantasy Consumer Advocacy league. [The New York Times]

$2 million
Joel Hodgson, the creator of “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” announced a $2 million Kickstarter on Tuesday to revive the show. By 5 p.m. Tuesday the fundraiser had more than $500,000 in pledges, and by 8 a.m. today the Kickstarter was already past $900,000. [NPR]

$21 million
Estimated price that Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James paid for a home in the Los Angeles area recently. On the one hand, James has been involved in Hollywood with movies such as “Trainwreck,” but on the other, Cleveland fans have every right to get skittish when James buys real estate in other cities with decent basketball teams. [Variety]

$1.5 billion
Value of fine wine stored in an old mine outside of Bath, England. Humidity is kept at 80 percent, and the natural temperature is 55 degrees; the casks are stored for auction houses, investors and collectors. [Bloomberg]

$15 billion
Estimated global sales of soup this year, down from a peak of $16.2 billion in 2012. The shrinking market has led soup manufacturer Campbell’s to do some serious re-evaluation of its recipes, for instance planning to cut the ingredients in its chicken soup to 20 from 30. [The New York Times]

1 degree Celsius
For the first time, global temperatures this year will be more than 1 degree Celsius higher than pre-Industrial Revolution levels. This is partly because of the El Niño effect, but it is nonetheless a sign of things to come, according to Britain’s Met Office, the national weather service of the U.K. [Reuters]

2 ice volcanoes
NASA announced evidence of two ice volcanoes near Pluto’s south pole, which really makes Earth look like it’s not even trying. Sure, we’ve got normal volcanoes, but volcanoes belching ice, ammonia and methane? That’s some Hoth-level geology, Pluto, and makes us look like chumps here on our own terra firma. [The Verge]

104 games
The Xbox One will support 104 games that were previously available on the Xbox 360, finally implementing promised backward capability for Microsoft’s newer console. [The Verge]

$26,000
A man was arrested Sunday after police say he tried to set fire to an 80-by-50-foot flag that flies near the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ stadium after the team lost to the New York Giants. The flag cost $26,000, some of which apparently went toward making the banner flame-resistant. That guy is, without doubt, the worst pirate I’ve ever seen. [ESPN]

48,000 positions
The trucking industry is hurting: The industry is about 800,000 strong, and it has 48,000 open positions. Only recently has truck drivers’ average pay begun to rise, which may help companies fill those spots, but in a business with massive turnover — between 90 and 100 percent — the lack of drivers is still a major concern. [The Huffington Post]

$718,000
M.C. Dean, a communications contractor, may face a $718,000 proposed fine from the Federal Communications Commission after the agency caught it blocking WiFi hotspots in the Baltimore Convention Center. [The Consumerist]

1 million euros
French police last week arrested Lamine Diack, the former president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, who is accused of accepting more than 1 million euros in bribes from Russian athletics to cover up widespread doping by the nation’s competitors. The allegations are laid out in a new report from the former head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, detailing cheating from the Russian athletics federation. [The Guardian]

100 million
Estimated number of people who could be driven into extreme poverty by 2030 because of the deleterious effects of global climate change, according to the World Bank. If you’re wondering why it seems like everyone is all of a sudden trying to drop the most fire climate change paper of 2015, the United Nations is hosting a climate summit in Paris this month.

3 seconds
Geoff Britten became the first American Ninja Warrior in the six-year existence of the NBC show of the same name, completing the required feats of strength with just 0.35 seconds to spare, putting him in line for the $1 million prize. Problem was, just minutes later Isaac Caldiero became the second American Ninja Warrior, besting Britten by three seconds and winning away the $1 million for himself. [Vice Sports]

11 points
To call Chelsea’s Premier League campaign thus far, and defense of its league title, rocky would be to do great insult to rocks. The team has garnered just 11 points through its first 12 games, worse than any other defending champ besides Ipswich Town in 1961. Chelsea’s seven losses are unprecedented for a defending champion this early in the season. [FiveThirtyEight]

The ground opened up in an IHOP parking lot in Meridian, Mississippi, swallowing about 15 vehicles. No one appeared to be hurt in the cave-in, which was about 50 feet wide and 600 feet long. [USA Today]

Myanmar held its first democratic elections in 25 years. Votes are still being counted in an election that saw more than 6,000 candidates from over 90 parties running for the country’s 664-seat parliament. Voter turnout may be as high as 80 percent. [BBC]

47 percent higher
The Trump Bump lives. “Saturday Night Live” viewership ratings for the episode hosted by Donald Trump over the weekend were the show’s highest since 2012 — and were 47 percent higher than the ratings during Hillary Clinton’s guest appearance earlier this season. Why? I have no idea. [Entertainment Weekly]

About $115 a day
About $115 a day will get you a bed and three meals on an ocean freighter. As the global economy has slowed, and the shipping business along with it, marine freight companies have been offering no-frills cruises on their massive vessels. That’s more expensive than a ride on a typical Carnival cruise — and without the discotheque — but it’s well worth it to largely avoid the, like, other people. [Bloomberg Businessweek]

300 gigabytes
In what is nothing less than a crime against humanity, Comcast is testing bandwidth caps on home Internet use. Under the scheme, customers have a monthly limit of 300 gigabytes and pay an overage fee of $10 for every additional 50 gigabytes they use. The company has rolled this out in three cities, with plans to expand. Call your congressman. [Engadget]

$1,639.47
Marco Rubio had a Florida GOP credit card for four years in his role as head of campaign operations for Florida House Republicans. During that time, he was hit with seven delinquency charges that totaled $1,639.47. [New York Times]

$2.4 million
John Lennon’s guitar sold for $2.4 million at auction, significantly beating estimates. The 1962 J-160E Gibson Acoustic, originally purchased for 161 pounds, was used to record “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “She Loves You.” [Time]

60 million people
Nearly 60 million people are displaced by war and persecution. The New York Times introduced its readers to a few of them over the weekend, via virtual reality. The newspaper included Google Cardboard viewers with its Sunday deliveries; they can be used with an immersive video feature on a custom smartphone app. [New York Times]

0 shows
So far into this season of television, none of the four major networks have cancelled a television show. In recent years, the ratings for several poorly performing new programs would have been enough to get an ax, but they’re all still kicking. Networks haven’t gone this long without a cancellation since the 1950s, according to the people who pay close attention to these things. [Los Angeles Times]

Average amount of time Sean Connery was shirtless onscreen during his stint as James Bond, the highest amount of time of any Bond. [Bloomberg]

A water main replacement at NYU uncovered a 200-year-old burial chamber with the remains of nine to 12 people loosely entombed inside. There was also a stack of a dozen coffins. [The Associated Press]

14.6 percent drop
Men’s Wearhouse, which owns the Jos. A. Bank brand, announced Thursday that sales were cratering at Jos. A. Bank following the phasing out of several popular sales. Third quarter sales were down 14.6 percent, which was way off from what the company was expecting. Traders in nice suits quickly sold the stock; it was down 36 percent before the opening bell Friday.

2,000 high schools
Adidas announced it would offer financial support to any of the 2,000 American high schools with racial epithets as their name or mascot — you know, just like the Washington football team — if they wanted to change their name. This enraged the D.C. metropolitan american football squad, which released a statement claiming that Adidas was acting hypocritically. “Adidas make hundreds of millions of dollars selling uniforms to teams like the Chicago Blackhawks and the Golden State Warriors, while profiting off sales of fan apparel for the Cleveland Indians, Florida State Seminoles, Atlanta Braves and many other like-named teams,” the team spokesman said.

6 penguins
When you hear “Australia” and “animal” in the same sentence, you’re probably dealing with something dangerous, venomous, weird, horrifying, or some combination of the four. It’s the evolutionary Thunderdome down there. However, there’s a rare heartwarming story coming out of Australia’s animal kingdom: the resurgence of what’s called the little penguin. On Middle Island, the population had crashed from 800 little penguins to six thanks to invasive foxes decimating the colony. After locals introduced highly territorial sheepdogs to protect the colony, the population is back in the triple digits. The strategy will be applied elsewhere following the success. [The New York Times]

41 cents
Cost per year per American citizen for NASA’s entire Curiosity program, which put a robot on Mars. While NASA projects have a generally large budget (tossing stuff into space isn’t easy), from an annualized and normalized point of view it’s actually rather cheap. [Popular Science]

54.4 percent
Percentage of black millennials who reported that they or someone they knew had been harassed or the subject of violence from police, according to a new University of Chicago report. Compare that to a third of whites and a quarter of Latinos. [PBS]

4 years
It’s only been a few months, but civilization has withered without Jon Stewart on television. But on Tuesday, HBO announced a four-year deal with the former host of “The Daily Show,” focusing at first on short-form content for the digital platforms, like HBO Go, you’re using your roommate’s girlfriend’s parent’s credentials to access. [Medium]

6.5 percent growth
Welcome to China, where GDP growth doesn’t matter and the points are made up. President Xi Jinping set a new GDP growth floor, “suggesting Beijing could tolerate growth as low as 6.5 percent.” But China’s economic figures are the subject of substantial skepticism from well-regarded analysts like the International Monetary Fund. [The Wall Street Journal]

20 times
Are you looking to hire someone to fill a tech job? Do you have a drug-free workplace? It’s probably best not to bring that latter point up: An advertisement for a technology position is 20 times likelier to perform among the worst quartile of ads if you mention that drugs are not welcome in your shop, according to a study of job postings by Texito, a language analysis startup. Having seen the documentary “Silicon Valley,” I can understand this reticence among programmers. [Bloomberg]

31 percent
Alcoa, the aluminum producer, will eliminate 503,000 metric tons of domestic smelting capacity due to the metal’s falling price. That amounts to 31 percent of the U.S.’s aluminum smelting capacity, a business that is rapidly moving overseas in search of cheaper labor and higher production rates. [Bloomberg]

41 percent genuine
A new report to Chinese lawmakers claims that less than 59 percent of products sold online in the nation in the past year were genuine. China has for years been seeking to overcome a reputation for counterfeit goods, but a booming e-commerce market means that nobody really wants to enforce the laws defining what’s real. [The Guardian]

50 percent
Percentage of younger millennials — those born between 1990 and 1996, like me — who believe in a god with absolute certainty, the lowest level of any age bracket according to a Pew Research Center survey. In the same age bracket, only 38 percent said religion was very important in their lives. [Pew Research Center]

59 percent
Percentage of adult Americans who took a prescription drug in 2012, up from 51 percent in 2000. [The Washington Post]

75 terabytes
Microsoft thought it was a great idea to offer “unlimited” cloud storage, until the obvious happened and several subscribers to its OneDrive service uploaded more than 75 terabytes of data each. This led Microsoft to realize its essential error: trusting consumers. Now, there’s a 1 terabyte cap on Microsoft’s unlimited cloud storage. For those keeping score at home, a terabyte is about 1,000 gigabytes, and while the concept of infinity has always confused me, I don’t think that qualifies as “unlimited.” [Slate]

$671,061
Earnings of the average person in the top 1 percent of wage earners in 2014. In a terrifying tale of heartbreak and woe, the incomes of the top 1 percent may be stagnating. Unfortunately, the player of the world’s smallest violin has seen brisk work lately and is thus in this income bracket and unavailable for a performance. But, I assure you the player of the world’s smallest didgeridoo — a man of more modest means — was emphatically pouring it out for these poor souls. [FiveThirtyEight]

7.7 to 10.8 percent
A preliminary study about the impact that Spotify has had on the music business contains an interesting nugget: in a given country, the top 50 tracks accounted for between 7.7 and 10.8 percent of all streams in a given week. [FiveThirtyEight]

9 states
In nine states, the average per-gallon price of regular unleaded gasoline is lower than $2. South Carolina has the cheapest gas of all. [The Post and Courier]

30 percent growth
We may be approaching Peak Avocado. The approximate increase in demand for avocados in the past year was 30 percent, according to food supplier Reynolds. That the fruit has been introduced to Chinese markets to wide acclaim is also going to fuel avocado demand. As someone who considers avocados the mayonnaise of vegetables — I think it’s on too much stuff, too neutral tasting, I never know when it’s gone bad and it’s really only good when a bunch of spices are mixed in — I’m indifferent to this. [The Guardian]

67 degrees
The GOP field has compiled an odd list of demands for future networks hosting primary debates, including forbidding moderators from asking candidates to raise their hands or from directors to include audience reaction shots. Perhaps the weirdest is that they “pledge that the temperature in the hall be kept below 67 degrees,” presumably to mitigate profuse sweating. This is very easy to work around, because they forgot to provide a unit. Networks can and should set the thermostat below 67 degrees Celsius out of spite, and as a way to ensure our next potential president has both attention to detail and the ability to negotiate with Vladimir Putin in his sauna. [The Washington Post]

80 days

2,250 feet long
A 150-foot wide crack that runs for about 2,250 feet has opened up in the foothills of Wyoming, believed to be the result of a landslide. The pictures are horrifying and and also fantastic but still not a reliable reason to go to Wyoming. [Atlas Obscura]

11,000 applications
The Liberal party dominated last week’s Canadian elections, and that means the new government is looking for people to fill roughly 1,000 open positions. The Liberal party reported receiving upwards of 11,000 applications for jobs in the new government since Friday. [CBC]

12339
China has set up an emergency phone line to report spies. People can now dial 110 for police, 119 for a fire, and 12339 if they want to report espionage. This is a contrast to the United States, where if you speak loudly and clearly into any cellphone you can probably be pretty sure the right people are hearing the news. [The New York Times]

$5.9 billion
In a massive acquisition, games developer Activision bought King Digital, the company behind Candy Crush and Farm Hero and their assorted successor brands, for $5.9 billion. Consider for a hot second that a company just paid more money for a producer of mobile games fueled by in-app purchases than Disney (where I work) paid for Star Wars. [VentureBeat]

2 hours, 10 minutes, 34 seconds
Kenyan Stanley Biwott won the New York City Marathon Sunday, and Mary Keitany, also of Kenya, won a repeat women’s title with a time of 2:24:25. Sunday was a great day to walk home in New York — it was fun to guess if the sweaty, dehydrated person in colorful tights was a marathoner or a hungover Halloween reveler trying to get home from the night before. [The Associated Press]

4 leagues
Sunday was the U.S. sport’s equinox, when each major American men’s sports league had an event going on. There was a World Series game, 12 NFL games, 7 NBA games and 5 NHL games on the calendar. It was the 15th such event in history. [FiveThirtyEight]

7-2
The Kansas City Royals won the World Series Sunday night in a 12th inning massacre, winning 7-2 over the New York Mets at Citi Field in Queens. [ESPN]

14 touchdowns
Of the rest of the events on the sport’s equinox, the strangest was the game between the New York Giants at New Orleans Saints, which ended in a 52-49 New Orleans win. The game led to a whole bunch of records: Drew Brees became the eighth quarterback to throw seven touchdowns in a game, and the 13 touchdowns Eli Manning and Brees threw combined was an NFL record as well. Manning was the first person to throw six touchdowns and no interceptions in a game and still lose it. Giants fan and Game of Thrones scribe George R.R. Martin would go on to comment, “All in all, a horrid day. Life is miserable and full of pain,” so I’m pretty sure he wrote your favorite character’s death last night. [ESPN]

25 years old
IMDb, one of the oldest internet-native brands still kicking, celebrated its 25th year since its founding in a USENET group in October of 1990. Keep in mind that the World Wide Web wasn’t launched until 1991, and that I am only a month older than IMDb. [VentureBeat]

About 1,000 police officers
Number of police officers in 41 states who were stripped of their badges relating to an incident of sexual misconduct, sex crimes, or rape in a six-year period, according to an Associated Press investigation. [The Associated Press]

Beverly Hills, California was fined $61,000 for not forcing residents to reduce water consumption during the state’s stifling drought. It’s the only non-desert municipality to face a fine. Not exactly a great look. [Reuters]

Thrift Land USA of Yonkers, New York, will pay the state $700,000 after it was found to have made $10 million off of clothes it claimed would go to charity. [WMTW]

9.3 million square feet
New real estate space for churches and places of worship in the year 2015, down from a dizzying high of 51.9 million new square feet of space added in 2002. This year will have the lowest level of new space added for houses of worship since it began to be tracked in 1967. [The Wall Street Journal]

5 out of 6
It’s not looking great for the New York Mets: Down two games in the World Series, they are at home against Kansas City tonight. Historically, five out of six teams down two games to none in a best-of-seven series go on to lose. [FiveThirtyEight]

85 percent
The percentage of alcohol-dependent adults who are also dependent on nicotine — or, as I like to call it, synergistic vice. Why smoking is appealing to drinkers is somewhat unknown, but an experiment on hard-partying rats found that it might have to do with the anti-sleep effects of nicotine. [Futurity]

86 percent
Since rugby rankings were introduced in 2003, New Zealand’s team has been the top-ranked squad 86 percent of the time. New Zealand will face Australia in an ANZAC grudge match in the worldwide Rugby World Cup final Saturday at the delightfully named Twickenham, in England. [Rugby World Cup]

$99.99
A mass-produced foam surfboard is taking the surfing community by storm, rivaling boards that traditionally sell for about $300. The board, called Wavestorm and available through Costco, has sold about a half-million units since its introduction in 2007. Wavestorm’s growth is odd in an industry that has traditionally used boards designed or hawked by prominent surfers and in a market that has seen slow annual growth and bankruptcies, such as Quiksilver, in recent years. [Bloomberg]

112 pages
A 112-page internal document was leaked from Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. It includes an advertising plan and internal polling — and blasts Marco Rubio, who is also seeking the Republican nomination. [U.S. News & World Report]

236 votes
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin was elected speaker of the House, winning 236 votes from his caucus. Good luck — you’ll need it. [The Guardian]

285 votes
The European Parliament voted 285 to 281 in support of a resolution stating that Edward Snowden should be able to seek asylum in the European Union, a move to protect the leaker from extradition to the United States. [Wired]

3.7 billion
The number of people younger than 50 who have the herpes simplex virus type 1, the kind that gives you cold sores around the mouth for the most part, unless you really screw up and get it on your genitals. [Reuters]

$4.4 billion
China’s steel business is seeing big drops in demand, with medium- to large-sized firms seeing losses of $4.4 billion in the first nine months of the year. [Bloomberg]

57.3 percent
The percentage of Kansas City homes that tuned in to the first game of the World Series on Tuesday night, compared with 27 percent of New York City homes. The Royals won that game, and Wednesday night’s too. The Mets return home for the third game, so maybe they’ll turn it around. [CNN Money]

80 percent
The percentage of the 100 most conservative Republican members of Congress who have not yet made an endorsement in the GOP presidential primary. For the 100 most moderate Republican members, that figure is 66 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

$136
A man who strapped a horrifying Halloween children’s doll into the passenger seat of his car to gain access to a high-occupancy vehicle lane in Tacoma, Washington, was slammed with a $136 ticket by a state trooper. I commend this man as our modern society has stripped away the true meaning of Halloween, which is mischief to satiate whatever trickster god may look favorably upon it. [Associated Press]

150 miles
A specialized military communications blimp became untethered from a mooring in Maryland and blew unguided 150 miles into Pennsylvania. The erstwhile dirigible deflated for an unknown reason, which is nice, because if my history is right, an uncontrolled military communications computer system is basically how Skynet happened and I made plans for the weekend so I don’t need that in my life. [Associated Press]

1,500
Japan has an aging population, the result of decades of declining birth rates and the inexorable forward motion of time. As a result, the nation has a bunch of empty school buildings and has to find something to do with them. Between 2002 and 2013, Japan closed 5,800 school buildings, about 1,500 of which were still in need of a purpose as of 2014. Others have been demolished or turned into rec centers for seniors, private businesses and in one case a hot springs spa. [Quartz]

$5,787
William Gay, a cornerback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was fined $5,787 by the NFL for wearing purple shoes to commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Gay’s mother was killed by his stepfather, so the issue is personal for Gay. [NBC Sports]

1.5 million
The worldwide death toll from tuberculosis last year. The disease now kills more people than HIV/AIDS. [Wall Street Journal]

12.95 million
The number of viewers of the premiere episode of the new CBS show “Supergirl,” which tells the story of Clark Kent’s Kryptonian cousin. The show tied for the biggest premiere for a new show in the young adult demographic this year. [Variety]

How much “Jurassic World” has made in the home-release portion of its run, by far the biggest seller of the year. [Variety]

1:25
Odds that a random spectator would score on a half-court shot after warming up a bit, according to a company that specializes in underwriting those types of promotions — the ones with the disproportionately large checks — seen at basketball games, golf outings and NCAA bracket tournaments. Rather than actually putting up the money up front, organizers pay for insurance from companies like SCA Promotions to hedge their bets against paying out. [Bloomberg]

4 of 10
Chris Ingraham at The Washington Post tracked down 10 reported incidents of a dog accidentally shooting a person since 2004, the latest of which occurred in Indiana last weekend. Not really shocking anyone, four of the 10 took place in Florida, where weird news brews in the primordial soup of synthetic marijuana and weapons. [Washington Post]

7 percent
The percentage of U.S. kids ages 17 and below who have had a parent in jail at some point in their lives. [PBS]

8 percent
As part of a U.S. budget deal reached this week in Washington, the federal government will sell more than 8 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve starting in 2018. The U.S. is currently sitting on 695 million barrels of reserves. [Bloomberg]

31 percent
Apple announced a huge quarter Tuesday: The tech firm’s profits rose 31 percent compared with the same period last year, largely bolstered by sales in China. [Wall Street Journal]

99.88 percent
Jason Pierre-Paul, the star defensive end for the New York Giants who suffered an injury from fireworks this summer that resulted in the loss of his right index finger and part of his thumb, signed a deal with the franchise and may get back on the field as early as Week 10. I did some calculations, and it’s nice to have 99.88 percent of Pierre-Paul back, especially because the Giants have a mere nine sacks this year. [Bleacher Report]

184 goals
Abby Wambach, who led the United States to victory at this year’s Women’s World Cup, announced her retirement from the sport. She’s definitely the greatest of all time, going out with 184 goals in international play, more than any soccer player in history, man or woman. [FiveThirtyEight]

$4,388,600,000
The amount of money raised by venture capital firms in the third quarter of 2015, according to an industry trade group and Thomson Reuters. That is down 59 percent from the second quarter and down 33 percent from the same quarter last year. Maybe the smart money is walking out of the room, maybe not, but that is a precipitous slip. [National Venture Capital Association]

$79 billion
Northrop Grumman won a contract estimated to be worth $79 billion to produce up to 100 stealth bombers for the Air Force, a massive deal even by defense industry standards and one that will basically set the course for how good America might be at bombing stuff with subtlety for the next half-century.

1-6
After starting the season 1-6, the Detroit Lions fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and promoted quarterbacks coach Jim Bob Cooter, which is a real name of a real person, to OC. [CBS Sports]

18 percent
The percentage of Kansas residents who said they were “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with Gov. Sam Brownback in a new statewide survey. That’s a very low approval rating of a GOP governor in a very red state. President Obama got higher ratings in the survey than Brownback. [The Kansas City Star]

25th album
David Bowie’s 25th studio album, “Blackstar,” is scheduled to drop on the singer’s 69th birthday, in January. [Rolling Stone]

50 grams
A new study boldly claims that consuming an additional 50 grams of processed meat per day increases the (already rather low) risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent. But screw it: I’m willing to roll those dice. [Bloomberg]

10,000 guns
A man arrested on drug-trafficking charges in South Carolina was found to be in possession of as many as 10,000 stolen guns, according to police. That is a big enough arsenal to arm every man who fought under George Washington in the Battle of Brooklyn, the largest battle of the Revolutionary War. [New York Daily News]

11,000 patients
The largest clinical study ever is kicking off in the United Kingdom. Researchers will follow 11,000 patients over 12 years to try to find out how aspirin affects different types of cancer. I look forward to learning the results at the end of Donald Trump’s third term. [Motherboard]

127,000
The number of Christian missionaries the United States sent out to the rest of the world in 2010, by far the most of any nation. The International Mission Board, associated with the Southern Baptist Convention, is scaling back its efforts because of funding problems. [Wall Street Journal]

2.36 million 
The average number of viewers per minute of Sunday’s Yahoo-streamed NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars. While that’s not up to television viewership levels enjoyed by most afternoon and late games, it’s still a huge number for an Internet stream. [CNN Money]

$100 million
The estimated amount that Microsoft spent developing “Halo 5,” which dropped last night at midnight. Usually I’m the only one up at midnight in my apartment as my roommates are adults who have self-control with their bed times and sleep schedules and I am not, but they were nonetheless up to mainline the game as soon as it became available and report good things. [USA Today]

$26.5 billion
The size of the market for financial data. The IntercontinentalExchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, announced that it will buy the Interactive Data Corp., a financial data company that controls roughly 3.5 percent of that market. [New York Times]

The percentage of people who have played in an NHL game this year who were born after Jaromir Jagr made his debut in the league on Oct. 5, 1990. [CBS Sports]

70 percent
A comedian and former television star has won the Guatemalan presidential election. With 92 percent of ballots counted, Jimmy Morales had 70 percent of the vote. This is a good story to send to your friend who is disconcertingly into Donald Trump but doesn’t think he could win it all. [Wall Street Journal]

165 mph
Estimated wind speed of Hurricane Patricia when it slammed into Mexico on Friday. The storm was only the eighth recorded hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. or Mexico at Category 5 strength. [FiveThirtyEight]

295 bears
Florida’s controversial bear hunt ended after two days and the killing of 295 bears. More than 3,200 people bought permits to participate — that’s about the same number as the state’s estimated black bear population. The idea of thousands of armed Floridians going into battle with thousands of bears is both horrifying and amazing. [Associated Press]

150,000 alpacas
The alpaca bubble has burst, with farmers wiped out in the price crash practically giving the animals away. Because of breeding programs, U.S. supply has swollen to about 150,000 alpacas, while demand never exactly materialized. [KUNC]

$7.3 million
“Steve Jobs,” that movie about the co-founder of Apple that doesn’t have Ashton Kutcher in it, brought in a lame $7.3 million at the box office in its first weekend in wide release. The film has positive reviews and awards buzz, but that’s a disappointing opening and could mean the movie flops. [Variety]

$46.4 million
The Mets’ postseason run has had an economic impact of $46.4 million on New York City, according to the city’s economic development corporation. That includes money from ticket sales, spending by tourists and additional earnings for seasonal employees. [amNew York]

$500 million
Estimated advertising revenue this year for the AMC television network, which has been buoyed by hit shows like “The Walking Dead” and other scripted content. Five years ago, AMC pulled in about half that amount. [New York Times]

Over the next four years, Washington state anticipates collecting a total of more than $1 billion in tax revenue from marijuana sales. [Bloomberg]

3 free suits
Jos. A. Bank’s famous “buy one suit, get three suits free” sale will end for the final time this coming Sunday. Men’s Wearhouse bought the company in March of 2014. [CNN Money]

6 percentage points
In an average of six polls, that’s how much support swung in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s favor in the Democratic primary since the first debate. She’s got the largest bump of any other contenders, and with Jim Webb and Joe Biden out already, and Lincoln Chafee circling the drain, this may come out to be a rather good week for the Clinton camp. [FiveThirtyEight]

7 arson attempts
Someone set fire to the doors of the Shrine of St. Joseph church, “marking the seventh attempt to burn a place of worship in the St. Louis area in two weeks.” Listen, I’m no Encyclopedia Brown, but I feel like it may be a good time for police to start, you know, running patrols past churches. Just a hunch. [The Kansas City Star]

11 cents
The FCC is cracking down on companies that ripoff inmates on phone fees, capping the per-minute cost of a call at 11 cents for prisons and 14 to 22 cents for jails. [The Huffington Post]

30 percent
Percentage of the American workforce that is either self-employed (10 percent) or employed by someone who is self-employed (20 percent) in 2014. Both groups together account for approximately 44 million jobs. [Pew Research Center]

50 pots of coffee
A Tumblr run by the National Archives about cool documents turned up a real gem this week: When Dick Cheney was deputy chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, he wrote a very terse memo ratting out Donald Rumsfeld and his team of nine for consuming $100 worth of coffee per month, which breaks down to 50 pots per week. Lightweights, all of them. [Today’s Document via Mental Floss]

90 percent
Vladimir Putin has a 90 percent approval rating in Russia, according to a state-run pollster that is totally legit and in no way influenced by Vladimir Putin, who controls the state that runs it. [The Guardian]

41,710 bite wounds
Number of people who went to the emergency room in the U.S. in 2012 with bite wounds inflicted by another human. [The Washington Post] 

200,000 riders
The Port Authority Bus Terminal handles about 200,000 people per day (one being me). But the terminal is more than 50 years old and is completely unable to handle increased traffic. The Port Authority’s board voted to investigate ways to replace the terminal. My favorite story is the time I saw the guy using the Internet terminals at the pizza joint in the south building to watch pornography during rush hour. Do you have any Port Authority Bus Terminal stories? Did it ever get weird? Send ’em over to @WaltHickey, we have to memorialize this awful scrap-heap while it’s still around. [ABC 7 New York]

$5 billion
Amazon had an earnings report drop Thursday that exceeded investor expectations, sending the stock shooting up. Since lots of CEO Jeff Bezos’ wealth is tied up in that stock, he added an additional $5 billion to his net worth, making him the third richest American. [Business Insider]

Time since Blink-182’s last album. But, word on the street is the band is coming out with a new one. People who shout along to music in cars, like me, are in a very good place right now. [Mic]

6 documents
WikiLeaks published six documents apparently hacked from CIA Director John Brennan’s personal AOL email as a demonstration that yes, several teenagers did break into the director’s stash. [Motherboard]

10 to 20 people
Number of people in Australia — a supposedly lovely country that is swarming with poisonous, venomous, and aggravated animals — who are bitten annually by the funnel-web spider and must get antivenom, often within an hour. As a result, Australia has drop-off centers for deadly spiders so the proper antivenom can be developed. [Wired]

$12.99 per month
YouTube Red subscribers will pay $10 per month in order to avoid ads. But the really interesting part of this is how aggressively Google is trolling Apple by cranking up the price to $12.99 on iOS, since Apple gets 30 percent of all App Store purchases. [Washington Post]

“25”
Adele announced that her next album will continue the pattern of being named after her age. It will be titled “25.” [BBC]

30 percent
Percentage of global Uber trips that CEO Travis Kalanick reported occur in China. [The Wall Street Journal]

372 points
Following the endorsement of Hillary Clinton by Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, Clinton will go into the Iowa caucuses with more endorsement points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s reckoning, than any Democrat since at least 1980. [FiveThirtyEight]

2,950 experiments
“Mythbusters,” the last good show on the Discovery Channel, will come to an end next year following its 14th and final season. When all is said and done, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage will have put 2,950 myths to an experimental test. Anyone with decent health insurance is welcome to come over to my place to try out for my “Mythbusters” replacement, but it’s most likely a really good way for all participants to get their names on lists. [Entertainment Weekly]

$2 million
Gimlet Media, the podcast startup behind the podcast StartUp, as well as Mystery Show, Reply All and others, reported $2 million in its first year, proving to parents the world over that podcasts are a real thing and “please, get out of my room dad.” [Nieman Lab]

6.5 million
Toyota is recalling 6.5 million cars because of a problem with the power windows switch. Having seen “Fight Club” — and, in particular, that scene in which the narrator talks about how car companies calculate the cost of a recall — I have spent the past day trying to guess how a power windows switch could possibly kill people. Please send all ideas to @WaltHickey, I’m trying to figure this one out. [NBC News]

Public Service Announcement: The Internet is going to suck today if you don’t like “Back To The Future Part II” (1989). Because when Marty McFly went back to the future in that movie, he traveled to Oct. 21, 2015. That’s today! And, in a shocker, a lot of stuff that moviemakers put in a 1989 film set in 2015 never came to be. Be sure to avoid all the tedious listicles of that stuff. In fact, I’ll save you the trouble (spoiler alert!): We don’t have hover boards. [FiveThirtyEight Vintage]

53.8 percent
Percentage of votes cast in the annual NBA general managers survey predicting the Cleveland Cavaliers will win the championship this season. The San Antonio Spurs came in second in the poll, with 25 percent of the vote. [ESPN]

54 percent
Percentage of Democratic-leaning voters who said they would support Hillary Clinton in a primary or caucus, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, up from 42 percent in September. [The Washington Post]

56 percent
Many Americans are full of nervous anticipation with Clinton’s appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi merely a day away. Or, maybe not. Americans don’t super care about the Benghazi investigation, with 56 percent reporting they were “not too closely” or “not at all closely” following the investigation. [FiveThirtyEight]

72 percent
Rep. Paul Ryan laid out his conditions for accepting the job of Speaker of the House yesterday. Mainly, he’d only accept the job if all the GOP factions get behind him. One of those factions is the Freedom Caucus, the group of hard-line conservatives who drove John Boehner out of the speaker job. The composition of this group is particularly interesting: 72 percent of them have served less than three terms, and none of them have been members of the institution for more than 10 terms. In the whole House of Representatives, those figures are 47 percent and 20 percent, respectively. [Pew Research Center]

97 percent
Percentage of Tesla owners surveyed by Consumer Reports who said they would purchase a Tesla again. Still, the consumer advocacy group said they decided to not recommend purchasing Tesla’s 2015 Model S sedan due to the car’s overall problem rate. It’s a huge blow to a car company that only last year obtained a perfect score for the model. [Re/Code]

$889
Average weekly earnings for a full-time male worker in the third quarter, compared to $721 for women. The gender wage gap widened, with men seeing a 2.2 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year, while women only saw a 0.8 percent increase. [The Wall Street Journal]

1,000,000 trees
A program initiated by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to plant a million trees in the city will finally reach its goal Wednesday, when the millionth tree — a lacebark elm destined to reside in Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx — will be planted with both the former mayor and current Hizzoner Bill de Blasio in attendance. [The New York Times]

$5.5 million
Sony Pictures will pay anywhere from $5.5 million to $8 million to put an end to a class action lawsuit from current and former employees who saw personal information leaked as a result of last year’s hack. The attorneys in the case will get about $3.5 million, while a $2 million fund will be set up to give up to $1,000 each to affected individuals. [The Hollywood Reporter]

$223 million
How much Yahoo paid in the third quarter in “traffic acquisition costs,” which is when a company pays for traffic to its website. That’s up from $54 million in the same quarter last year. Yahoo’s status as a crucial Internet hub appears to be in jeopardy. [Reuters]

An actor and a bystander were shot after a mock Old West gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, turned real: Live rounds were somehow placed in one of the guns. [The New York Post]

6.5 years
A DEA agent who helped bring down the Silk Road, the bitcoin-fueled Amazon.com of illegal drugs, was sentenced to six and a half years behind bars after pleading guilty to extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice. The agent “used his position in the investigation to swindle his way to a payout of more $700,000 in Bitcoin and a Hollywood contract.” [Mother Jones]

7 turnovers
Monday Night Football was grim last night, with the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants combining for seven turnovers, including Eli Manning’s pick-six. The Giants lost 27-7. On the other hand, we got the new Star Wars trailer at halftime, so the evening was an emotional wash for me. [Sports Illustrated]

24 percent
Toymaker Hasbro saw 24 percent growth in its boys division in the third quarter, largely thanks to the release of new “Star Wars” merchandise. Revenues from girls toys — for some reason Hasbro separates the two, which is so 2005 — were down 28 percent. [Quartz]

Tough break for Jeb Bush in a new Wall Street Journal/CBS News poll: 44 percent of GOP primary voters said they couldn’t even imagine themselves supporting his candidacy. [The Wall Street Journal]

184 seats
Still, not all is lost for the political progeny of prominent world leaders: Justin Trudeau, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, led the Liberal Party to a decisive win in Canada’s elections yesterday. The Liberals took 184 seats and scored a decisive majority over the incumbent Conservatives, led by current Prime Minister Stephen Harper. [CBC]

$250,000
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will announce a $250,000 gun buyback program. But it’s unclear whether buyback programs really reduce the availability of firearms in an area. [The Christian Science Monitor]

15 million users
Reported user count for Apple Music, Apple’s new streaming service. The catch: 8.5 million of those users are still on a free trial, leaving only about 6.5 million paying customers. For comparison, competitor Spotify had about 20 million paying subscribers as of June. [Engadget]

$43 million
Oprah Winfrey dropped $43 million to buy 10 percent of Weight Watchers, which sent the company’s stock shooting up. Weight Watchers has had a rough several years, with increased competition from other fitness services. [Forbes]

$6 billion
My favorite kind of mistake on Wall Street are “fat-finger” errors, which basically means someone pushed the wrong button at a critical moment and put a bunch of money in a place they would otherwise have preferred not to put it. I like these because I get to imagine a banker with disproportionately massive fingers. My delight aside, these mistakes are probably a gigantic headache for places like Deutsche Bank, where a junior foreign exchange trader accidentally transferred $6 billion to a U.S. hedge fund.

“Saturday Night Live” scored the casting coup of the year, getting Larry David to play doppelgänger and presidential candidate Sen.

2 super PAC events
Donald Trump may claim he doesn’t need a super PAC, but the “Make America Great Again” PAC — which like all super PACs seeks to separate rich people from lots of their money in order to elect another rich person — is still supporting his bid. And The Donald has supported the PAC: He’s appeared at at least two of its events. [The Washington Post]

According to Facebook, around 800,000 Americans have changed their profile in the past year to express a same-sex attraction. Call it the “Anthony Kennedy Facebook Effect.” [Facebook]

$4.2 million
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, still running for president, raised $4.2 million this past quarter, about 67 percent of which was already spent in the same period. Christie is barely hovering above the polling average needed to earn a podium at the forthcoming CNBC debate. He also killed the proposal to build another New Jersey to New York City tunnel, which has kind of ruined my commute for the past three years. So yes, I have a bone to pick with the guy. [The Wall Street Journal]

$77 billion
Cost to the U.S. economy in 2010 due to hungover workers, according to the CDC. In related news, today I learned the government is hella judgy. [Bloomberg]

6 months
Bloomberg terminals are vastly powerful and essentially mandatory data sources for the entire global financial industry. They also have a chat feature that is the primary way people in the banking business converse among themselves, a feature that can get so addictive that Bloomberg allows users who lose their jobs access to a terminal at home for free for six months just to keep them hooked. [FiveThirtyEight Podcasts]

12 percent
Wal-Mart stock took a quick dive yesterday after the company predicted profits would drop by as much as 12 percent in the next year. [The Wall Street Journal]

30 feet long, 7 feet wide
The Wolf Science Center in Austria installed a massive treadmill 30 feet in length and 7 feet in width in order to study cooperation among dogs and wolves. The scientists are interested in whether the animals are more likely to share food after going on a run together — like when your stoned friend promises to buy you a Doritos Locos Taco if you walk with him to Taco Bell. [Scientific American]

800 pounds
A court ruled that a former London Zoo meerkat expert must pay a former colleague — a monkey-handler whom she attacked with a wine glass — 800 pounds, which is about $1,235 in Florida, the place where this kind of news story typically happens. Both of the women had dated the same llama-keeper. If this was published anywhere except the Associated Press I would not have believed a single word of it. [Associated Press]

23,005 visits
A new study estimates just over 23,000 annual emergency room visits are due to side effects from the consumption of dietary supplements. As a result of this devastating news, I have decided to stop chasing tequila shots with Omega-3 fatty acid fish oil, or as I like to call the combination, a Moby Dickleback. [The New England Journal of Medicine]

With 83,844 Puerto Rico residents leaving the territory to move to the U.S. mainland and only 19,771 people making the reverse trip, that’s the net migration out of Puerto Rico, a level not seen in over 50 years. The territory is still in a recession that has lasted for almost a decade. [Pew Research Center]

$35 million
That’s how much House Speaker John Boehner raised for Republicans for the 2014 campaign through three PACs. Rep. Paul Ryan, who is being recruited aggressively for the speakership after Boehner’s resignation, doesn’t want the job or its awful fundraising circus. But some of the people encouraging Ryan are suggesting he could skip the fundraising if it means he’ll take the job. [Bloomberg]

Estimated number of people who have ever lived, from my colleague Mona Chalabi. A reader asked her about the demographics of heaven.

3.6
The Chicago Cubs saw the league’s biggest leap in ratings for their games this summer, more than doubling the number of viewers for an average rating of 3.6. The Cubs’ solid season has continued well into the playoffs: Chicago sank St. Louis on Tuesday and won its playoff series, meaning the Cubs are headed to the NLCS. [Forbes]

That’s the divorce rate in “The Sims 4,” according to the game’s publisher, EA, with 27.5 million marriages resulting in 1.7 million divorces. That’s vastly lower than the actual U.S. divorce rate. It also directly conflicts my understanding of the mechanics of “The Sims,” given that I’ve been working from the belief that all marriages ended either in death by burning appliance or by drowning because a cruel god removed all the ladders to exit the swimming pool.

11 questions
Foreign policy was the biggest topic at last night’s Democratic primary debate, with 11 questions asked. The economy was right behind with eight questions, and immigration and the assorted Clinton scandals accounted for six each. Be sure to check out our whole live coverage of the debate. [FiveThirtyEight]

$12
Cost of “A Glass Case of Emotion,” a cocktail at a Will Ferrell-themed cocktail bar opening in New York. The drink contains rosemary, peach, whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup, for amateur mixologists looking to take a chance on it. Other Ferrell-themed cocktails include the “Milk Was A Bad Choice,” the “You’re My Boy, Blue,” and “The F*cking Catalina Wine Mixer.” While I’m telling myself now that I intend to studiously avoid this bar, I make terrible decisions when drinking and so will let you know how it is once I inevitably check it out. [Vulture]

28 minutes, 10 seconds
How much time former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got to talk at last night’s Democratic debate, the longest of any candidate. Runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders talked for 26 minutes, 19 seconds, while rounding errors Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and that other guy, whatever his name is, all talked for 15 minutes or less. [ABC News]

Royal Dutch Shell is pulling out of Arctic drilling as the company struggles with decreasing oil prices across the board: Profits were down 50 percent between 2012 and 2014, whereas competitors Exxon Mobil and Chevron saw respective profit declines of 28 percent and 27 percent in the same period. [Newsweek]

$127,000
A Manhattan woman sued her 8-year-old nephew for $127,000, claiming the child was negligent when he jumped into her arms for a hug, injuring her. Yesterday a Connecticut jury decided to award the litigious aunt $0, because that is a terrible thing to sue over. [Connecticut Post]

The way New Yorkers get around above-ground is shifting with the ascendance of Uber. New Yorkers took 42 million yellow cab rides and 2 million Uber rides from April to June of 2014. In the same period this year, New Yorkers took 38 million cab rides but 8 million Uber rides; pickups were up only slightly overall. [FiveThirtyEight]

1 percent
In New York, any apartment sale of $1 million or more incurs a 1 percent mansion tax, meaning that a $1,000,000 home costs an extra $10,000 compared to a $999,999 home. This means that people trying to sell their apartments in that price range typically aim slightly lower than $1 million. Think of it as the same reason 99 cent stores caught on, only for plutocrats who would probably have enough leftover cash to fund a Most Dangerous Game if they’d just move to Jersey instead. [The New York Times]

Average number of vacation days taken by the American worker last year, a 35-year low and down from 21.1 days in 1996. Somewhere the French are mocking us. Oh, also, you’re going to ruin your kids if you don’t take vacation days, a new study says. [Harvard Business Review]

98.4 percent
The Kansas City Royals faced the Houston Astros on Monday, and just as it appeared the Astros had the game on lock — leading 6-2 with the bases loaded, and FanGraphs giving them a 98.4 percent chance of victory — the Royals grabbed the game back, going on to pull in four runs in two innings. [FanGraphs]

$43.6 million
Remember all that bad press last week about how employees of one daily fantasy site were caught using inside information to play at a rival daily fantasy site and win a ton of money in the process? I bet you thought it would spell some sort of negative consequence for the industry, right? Maybe distrust among the players, or perhaps a negative impact on revenue? Nah. FanDuel and DraftKings pulled in a combined $43.6 million in entry fees this past weekend, the largest haul for the pair ever. [Bloomberg]

4 percent
That’s Rand Paul’s support in a recent CBS News poll. It’s also just above the 3 percent needed to make it to the main stage of the next GOP primary debate on CNBC at the end of the month, rather than the J.V. debate, leaving Paul on the fence, along with Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee. [The Washington Post]

The Department of Agriculture is forecasting Florida’s orange crop will be the lowest it’s been in 52 years due to a citrus disease. This sounds, for all intents and purposes, like something that would happen in “Trading Places.” [Bloomberg]

Chicago is still in the hunt for a trip to the World Series, with a chance at its first title since 1908, when the Ottoman Empire was still around. As a result, prospective tickets for a home game in the series are wildly expensive: On the ticket sales site TiqIQ, the average asking price is $3,891. [Bloomberg]

$200,000
Amount South Carolina spends annually on dam maintenance and safety. After suffering catastrophic flooding, the notoriously stingy state infrastructure spending — highway maintenance is currently tethered to a gas tax that hasn’t gone up since 1987 — will have to rise to rebuild devastated thoroughfares. [U.S. News and World Report]

1.02 million
We have the first look at how Trevor Noah’s stint on “The Daily Show” is going: In the new host’s first week, the show averaged 1.02 million viewers, about two-thirds its audience at the same time last year. What’s weirdest about the show’s audience, though, is that it’s older: The median age of a viewer was 45.5 in Noah’s first week, a jump from 43.7 in Jon Stewart’s last. [Deadline]

Just like he wanted, college professor and Democratic presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig finally made his way into a live-interview poll. A Fairleigh Dickinson poll found that support for Lessig is less than 1 percent, a mere asterisk in the the Democratic primary. For context, former Maryland governor and rounding error Martin O’Malley is polling at 1 percent. [Fairleigh Dickinson University]

You know all those ludicrous “sexy” Halloween costumes? Sexy Donald Trump (the wig covers the most of the costume), Sexy Pizza Rat (a rat costume with pizza on it), Sexy Hurricane Joaquin (I made this one up; you just skip out on the party in Brooklyn everyone said you’d show up to) and Sexy Cecil the Lion (a lion with some leg)? Well, someone is making a dime off them, and that someone is Chad Horstman, CEO of Yandy.com, the headline-generating site that’s able to turn around a sexy, news-pegged costume in a mere two weeks.

In the 2014-15 season, hockey teams pulled their goalies — a last-ditch effort to increase offensive manpower at the expense of defense — with roughly 2 minutes and 10 seconds left on the clock, on average, 30 seconds earlier than in the 2013-14 season. [FiveThirtyEight]

Netflix is cranking up its monthly subscription price from $8.99 to $9.99, with people who joined before May 2014 seeing the hike take place in May and those who joined later seeing the hike next October. [Mashable]

48 hours
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled out of his doomed race for the Speaker of the House yesterday, leaving a huge vacuum in the GOP House leadership. Republicans are turning to Rep. Paul Ryan, the former vice presidential nominee who apparently does not want the thankless gig. Say what you will about the guy, but Ryan is a smart man who likely does not want to have the worst job on Earth. Still, following a call from outgoing Speaker John Boehner Thursday, Ryan cancelled all fundraising and political events for the next 48 hours. My god, they’re gonna eat him alive. [The Washington Post]

Beef is pretty expensive these days, but pork is very cheap. As a result, a lot of restaurants have been offering deals on pork dishes: In the first eight months of the year, there were 57 limited-time-only pulled pork dishes at the top 500 restaurants in the U.S. I have very little shame and I have extremely low standards, so the moral of this story is that I think I need a McRib. [Bloomberg]

$600,000
The former California home of an armored-truck driver who admitted to stealing upwards of $1 million was raided by the feds, who found $600,000 buried in the backyard. Man, can you imagine how the current residents feel? Like 600 Gs were just sitting in their backyard, and anyone with a shovel was able to score the loot? The moral of this story is that gardening is a worthwhile hobby and all should pursue it given the opportunity. [Yahoo News]

Artemisinin, a first-line treatment for malaria, just scored its developers a Nobel Prize in medicine. Problem is, malaria is a parasite and parasites are good at evolving, so parasitology experts believe artemisinin will be obsolete within five to 10 years. I am not a doctor, but I advise that if you plan on getting malaria, you should aim to do so within the next five to 10 years. [FiveThirtyEight]

Approximate strength of the “Freedom Caucus” within Congress, a group of hard-line Republicans who came out Wednesday backing Florida representative Daniel Webster for the speakership over Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Provided that bloc holds, McCarthy would not have enough votes to win the top spot in the House on the first ballot. [The Washington Post]

90 days
FIFA’s ethics committee has voted to hand down a 90-day provisional suspension to the soccer organization’s president, Sepp Blatter. The news here is not the suspension, but the fact that FIFA actually has an ethics committee. Who is on this committee? Snidely Whiplash? Lex Luthor? Resuscitated Richard Nixon? Victor Von Doom? Is it just several bales of hay with crayon-scrawled-on-paper-plate faces stuck on them? Is this the same committee that runs sensitivity training for The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants or OSHA on the Death Star? The concept that anyone within FIFA is tasked with maintaining a sensible degree of ethical behavior is insulting to the intelligence of soccer fans. More to the point, where have they been for the past ever? [BBC]

487 clients
A preliminary deal was struck earlier this week between the U.S. and 11 other pacific nations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A lot of negotiating on the trade pact was going on domestically, too — a Center for Responsive Politics review of lobbying disclosures over eight years found 487 different clients paid lobbyists to hit up government officials to plead their case on the TPP.

The White House will spend $700,000 on standing desks, presumably due to the craven political pursuit of trends that so plagues our society. People built a civilization sitting down to work, folks — believing anything else is merely ergonomic arrogance. [Mashable]

1,360,747
Number of homeless students in the United States, about twice the number there were in the 2006-2007 school year. Part of this increase is due to improved data reporting: States are getting better at identifying homeless students. [FiveThirtyEight]

A state judge rejected a proposed change to the name of Paul Smith’s College to Joan Weill-Paul Smith’s College. The change was proposed after Weill offered $20 million to the upstate New York school in exchange for getting her name on the door, but Smith’s will appears to forbid it. [The New York Times]

2.5 meters
That’s the standard height for a crocodile pit in Ratchaburi province, Thailand. Is that an esoteric figure? Sure. But believe me, if you lived in Ratchaburi, you’d want to be damn  sure the pits used by farmers to raise crocodiles were up to code. Crocs are kept by area pig farmers, who feed the crocodiles meat they can’t otherwise sell at market and then eventually sell the crocs’ skin and meat — a solid business venture. But “several” baby crocodiles recently escaped a farm and set off a panic, so Big Government is stepping in over the next couple of days to make sure the Crocodile Industrial Complex isn’t playing fast and loose with the regulations. Thank god I live in America, where (I assume) the Second Amendment protects my right to raise unlicensed crocodiles for the protection of my apartment without such government intrusion.

While the vast majority of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement is still under wraps, New Zealand let it slip Tuesday that the pact will require the nation to increase the length of its copyright protections from 50 years after the death of a work’s creator to 70 years, matching U.S. copyright law.

20,000 to 40,000
There’s life on Mars, probably — the issue is that we may have put it there. At the 2011 launch of the Curiosity rover, there were an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores on the robot, and NASA has to do a lot of work to make sure that any analysis to ascertain the presence of life on Mars isn’t influenced by the germs the rover brought with it. [The New York Times]

Percentage of education debt attributed to Americans over the age of 40, up from 25 percent in 2004.

Raffi Torres of the NHL’s San Jose Sharks was suspended 41 games — half a season — for a brutal (and very illegal) check on Jakob Silfverberg of the Anaheim Ducks in a preseason game. Torres has been, by Deadspin’s count, suspended four times, fined thrice, and warned twice for aiming for the head. [Deadspin]

$1,200
About 45 percent of PriceWaterhouseCoopers employees joined the accounting firm in entry-level positions in the past five years, which means a lot of them are contending with student loan debt. As a result, the company will next year start offering $1,200 per year to recent grads to help pay down their debt. [USA Today]

“Hamilton,” the hit musical about the nation’s first treasury secretary that is absolutely impossible to get tickets for, crams a whole lot of words into its run time. With a 2 hour and 23 minute cast album and 20,520 words of lyrics, the hip-hop influenced musical averages an impressive 144 words per minute. It’s a tough book to memorize, but if my Spotify listening history says anything, I am definitely committed to it. [FiveThirtyEight]

Totally-not-gambling daily fantasy sports sites have been hit with their first scandal: A DraftKings employee allegedly leveraged internal information about betting patterns in order to place winning bets at rival site FanDuel, winning $350,000 on a $25 wager. The companies made a joint statement denying any wrongdoing. (Also, full disclosure, DraftKings has advertised on this very column before.) [Deadspin]

The New York Jets played the Miami Dolphins in London’s Wembley Stadium on Sunday, a game that saw New York come away with a 27-14 win. As part of the team’s trip planning, a Jets intern apparently advised that the toilet paper in London is of inferior quality. So the team hauled over 350 rolls of top-tier American TP to be safe. [The Washington Post]

$800
Iraq’s Sulaymaniyah Museum makes deals with smugglers, buying up looted artifacts in order to prevent them from getting onto the black market to presumably be lost forever. This strategy seems to have panned out, with the discovery that a clay tablet bought in 2011 for $800 contained a previously unknown 20-line verse of “The Epic of Gilgamesh.” It’s pretty crazy that for half of what some of my friends are paying in New York City rent, they could have purchased a priceless artifact. [LiveScience]

$13 million
LinkedIn agreed to pay $13 million to members who felt bombarded by the social networking site’s — let’s just say dedicated — email notification policies. Anyone who was a member from Sept. 17, 2011, to Oct. 31, 2014, and used the “add connections” feature may want to check their email if they want to get a piece of the settlement. [Quartz]

$55 million
“The Martian” narrowly missed beating out “Gravity” for the highest-grossing October release record, pulling in $55 million over the weekend. It’s got Matt Damon in one of his brainiest and dreamiest roles, according to in-depth FiveThirtyEight statistical research. [Variety]

8 Chick-fil-A registers
Chick-fil-A, which hooked me during college with chicken sandwiches that made me briefly forget all closely held ethical beliefs, is opening a location in Manhattan. The chain expects its new store at 37th Street & 6th Avenue will have more traffic than any other store. And it will, if I have anything to do with it. The Manhattan Chick-fil-A has a phalanx of eight registers, with two more on standby, and mobile devices to ring people up. Remember folks: They stopped giving to anti-gay places, plus the war’s over and we won. Enjoy the chicken. [The New York Times]

8.01 percent
It’s October, so it’s breast cancer awareness month. But all that “awareness” doesn’t always translate into legitimate investment in cancer research. For example: Only an estimated 8.01 percent of the revenue from NFL breast cancer awareness merchandise goes to cancer research. [Business Insider]

17 percent
Percentage of C-suite executives who are women, according to new data from LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. [The Wall Street Journal]

42 percent
Percentage of women who reported they used tampons, according to a CDC study. About 62 percent reported using pads. (Some women used both.) Here’s what’s particularly interesting about all this: That survey was from 2004, and apparently nobody’s been interested in analyzing the health choices of half the population since. [FiveThirtyEight]

47 gigabytes
Edward Snowden joined Twitter, but made the basic mistake of not turning off email notifications. According to Snowden, he received 47 gigabytes worth of notifications from all the follows, favorites, retweets and direct messages. [@Snowden]

88.7 percent
That was the cash burn rate for the Hillary Clinton campaign over the summer; she raised $28 million and spent about $24.8 million. The Clinton camp has about $32 million in walking-around money right now. [The Washington Post]

90.5 points
That’s the over/under for the upcoming Texas Tech-Baylor college football game, the highest on record since 1990. Needless to say, these teams score a whole lot of points. [ESPN]

$5.4 million
Congress is taking action following the revelation the Department of Defense paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million over four years to salute the troops during its broadcasts. This year’s National Defense Authorization Act will ban such payments, so the NFL will have to be pro-The Troops on its own dime. [NJ Advance Media]

$310.5 million
Someone from Three Rivers, Michigan, won a Powerball jackpot advertised at $310.5 million. The Powerball lottery will soon be changing its odds, which if done right will lead to bigger jackpots. That would be great, because the lottery is my favorite thing, and I am so bored of jackpots in the $300 million ballpark. [ABC News]

4.4 percent
The New England Patriots are currently 3-0, leading some to speculate they’ll go undefeated through the rest of the year. According to my colleague Neil Paine, there’s a mere 4.4 percent chance of this happening. And according to Prophecy, even if it does happen, the New York Giants will beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl. [FiveThirtyEight]

5 attempted hacks
Russian hackers made five attempts to access the private email server of Hillary Clinton. There’s no evidence those attempts worked, and the U.S. government is currently dealing with a massive hack of Office of Personnel Management data, so I’m close to considering this a win for the Clinton camp. [Associated Press]

9.8 percent
Percentage of respondents to a Suffolk University poll who, when asked to describe Donald Trump in one word, said something like “idiot,” “jerk,” “stupid,” or “dumb.” And it’s not like the entire remaining 90.2 percent had nicer things to say either. [Business Insider]

45 employees
The Secret Service, which has lately been carrying out its duties with the professionalism of elementary schoolers with off-brand Nerf guns, is being scrutinized for accessing — and maybe leaking — information on a member of Congress investigating the agency. Secret Service employees dug up Rep. Jason Chaffetz’s unsuccessful 2003 application for a job with the agency “starting 18 minutes after the start of a congressional hearing in March about the latest scandal involving drunken behavior by senior agents… At least 45 employees viewed the file.” [Associated Press]

66 percent
Percentage of South Carolinians who said removing the confederate battle flag from state grounds was the right decision, about 50 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats. [Winthrop University]

115 miles per hour
Hurricane Joaquin is building up power near the Bahamas, and was upgraded to Category 3 status with sustained winds of 115 miles per hour. And Joaquin is forecasted to become a Category 4 storm. If you’re on the east coast, it’s always important to be prepared in the event of a big storm, so be sure to hit up the liquor store today before the lines get too long and the good stuff sells out. If you think I’m joking, and I mostly am, keep in mind that the City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Department confirmed my advice on Twitter early Wednesday night. [Capital Weather Gang]

200 servers
Yahoo! recently donated 200 servers to Howard University and The University of Texas at El Paso, a historically black college and a predominantly Mexican-American university, respectively. It’s part of an effort to increase diversity in the technology field, and at Yahoo! in particular. [TechCrunch]

6,500 meter summit
The Nepali government, after an explosion in the number of people attempting to climb Mount Everest, is considering instituting new requirements on the age and ability of climbers. Under the proposed rules, climbers would have to be between the ages of 18 and 75, climbers with disabilities would not be allowed to summit Everest if they cannot do so on their own, and each climber would need to have another 6,500 meter climb under their belt. [Outside]

1 Twitter account
Edward Snowden, who leaked documents from the National Security Agency two years ago before fleeing to Russia, has set up a Twitter account. He follows one other account: the NSA. [The Washington Post]

17 roster transactions
Life in the NFL can be tough; players get bounced around from team to team, and signed and released over and over again. One such player — Julian Vandervelde, currently an offensive lineman for the Philadelphia Eagles — has seen 17 such transactions since he was drafted in 2011. Most of those were with the Eagles in some way, shape or form. [Philly Voice]

23 endorsements
Number of endorsements Jeb Bush has accumulated from members of congress. That’s great and all, but they’re mostly a bunch of moderates, which doesn’t really help him build a broad base in the modern GOP. [FiveThirtyEight]

24 geniuses
On Tuesday, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation — you know, the people who brought you NPR — announced the 24 recipients of the MacArthur “genius grant,” a $625,000 no-strings-attached stipend. Winners include Ta-Nehisi Coates (“Between The World And Me“) and Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton“). [The New York Times]

$670.44
The most expensive Google ad keyword in the U.S. is “San Antonio car wreck attorney,” costing $670.44 each time someone on Google clicks the ad. The most expensive advertisements are for legal issues, as a given client can be worth a whole bunch of money for an attorney, and it’s a crowded market. [Quartz]

700,993 arrests
Number of marijuana-related arrests in 2014, up for the first time since 2009. [Motherboard]

1 million UAVs
The FAA expects that one million consumer-use drones will be sold during the holidays this year. That’s pretty terrifying when you consider the inevitable black-out-the-sun possibilities of armies of untrained aviators hitting the beaches and parks next summer. Then again, free drones if you can catch them with a butterfly net, right? [Popular Mechanics]

$2.5 million
San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York wanted to pave over youth soccer fields in order to build the football team’s new stadium, and during the construction process promised to rebuild them. Now, shiny new stadium in hand, York does not want to pay the $2.5 million to rebuild those soccer fields. [San Jose Mercury News]

$343 million
German media conglomerate Axel Springer has purchased a controlling stake in Business Insider, that Web site I used to work for and all of my friends either work at or used to work at. Axel Springer bought all but 3 percent of the shares, spending $343 million to crank up its stake from 9 percent to 97 percent. This is fantastic news, mostly because I heard Pam has equity and she owes me a drink. [The New York Times]

$732 million
ComScore purchased rival audience measurement company Rentrak on Tuesday in a stock deal, valuing the latter company at $732 million. The combined company is still an order of magnitude smaller than the biggest player in the game, Nielsen, which has a market cap of about $16.7 billion. [The Wall Street Journal]

$3.94
A congressman who swiped the Pope’s water glass following the pontiff’s address to Congress will owe the House Clerk $3.94. It’s nice to know obsessive fandom is weird no matter how elevated the fan. [The Washington Post]

40 percent
The percentage of Americans who have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of trust in the mass media, down from a high of 55 percent in 1999. Uh, you guys trust me, right? [Gallup]

60 percent
The share of Americans in a new Pew survey who said any budget that passes Congress must include funding for Planned Parenthood. About 32 percent said Congress should eliminate funding. [Pew Research Center]

77-19
The Senate voted 77-19 on Monday to pass a spending bill that would keep the government open through Dec. 11. The measure passed after a passage stripping federal funding for Planned Parenthood was removed from it. Of course, we’ll go through all of this again in December. [Associated Press]

94.6 percent
The House Republicans’ “Party Unity Score” in the 113th Congress whenever they were voting against Democrats, a testament to Speaker John Boehner’s proficiency at keeping his party in line. Although, that consensus did not keep together as well when a majority of both parties took the same side in a vote. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,500 jobs
Whole Foods is cutting 1,500 jobs over the next several months, roughly 1.6 percent of its work force, following a disappointing quarter for sales. [Fast Company]

Facebook has 2.5 million advertisers, up from one million in June 2013. Mobile ads account for about 76 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue. [Marketing Land]

3.3 million cars
And the Volkswagen story gets a little worse: Subsidiaries Audi and Skoda say they have a total of 3.3 million cars on the road that used the same software that lied about emissions data as their parent used. About 2.1 million of those are Audis. [BBC]

13 million iPhones
Apple announced it sold 13 million iPhone 6s and 6s Plus’s during their initial launch weekend, beating all previous iPhone opening weekends. [The Next Web]

4.8 percent
That’s how much fast-food breakfast sales rose from 2007 to 2012, a bright spot for the sector amid increased competition in the lunch and dinner hours from fast-casual restaurants. Growth in breakfast sales is one of the reasons we’re going to see all-day breakfast at McDonald’s in a little more than a week. [Eater]

20 percent
Last week was Premiere Week, when TV networks debut new seasons and new shows, and it left the networks worried. The first two days of the new TV season saw a 20 percent drop in 18- to 24-year-old viewers compared to 2014. [Ad Age]

26 pounds of marijuana
That’s how much pot landed on the car port of a home in Nogales, Arizona, a town near the Mexican border. It’s believed to have been dropped accidentally from a drug-smuggling aircraft, but I have a personal theory: It’s proof that God exists and loves us very much. [Yahoo! News]

1,756 days
Number of days John Boehner of Ohio will have served as Speaker of the House of Representatives when he resigns on Oct. 30, the 12th longest stint with the gavel in the chamber’s history. Boehner announced his intention to resign this past Friday. [FiveThirtyEight]

Google is partnering with Indian Railways and a local ISP to bring free high-speed Internet to 400 train stations across India. Meanwhile, I still can’t get service in the Times Square N train station. [CNET]

667-foot condominium tower
Remember that “Ground Zero mosque” controversy? The time some folks tried to build an Islamic community center in the vague vicinity of lower Manhattan, and people from out of town got upset? Well, the property owner is now proposing to build a 667-foot condominium tower there — the formal end of the life cycle all buildings in New York undergo on a long enough time span. Once a Burlington Coat Factory caterpillar, soon to be a luxury condo butterfly. I hope you’re happy. [Bloomberg News]

4,646 calls
ZVRS, which runs a service that allows the hearing disabled to make phone calls by teleconferencing with sign language interpreters, is suing a Brooklyn man. The man, ZVRS alleges, isn’t deaf and has made 4,646 calls in order to masturbate in front of the company’s interpreters. [New York Post]

“Obamacare” helped add nine million people to the health insurance rolls in 2014. But 33 million still went without insurance for the entire year, and new data shows they were mostly poor, black and Hispanic. [FiveThirtyEight]

$42.5 million
Adam Sandler’s “Hotel Transylvania 2” won the box office this past weekend, bringing in $42.5 million, a new record opening for the garbage month of September. Anne Hathaway’s “The Intern” came in second, the latest and coolest installment in Hathaway’s hot streak. [Variety]

1 hour, 12 minutes
This Sunday, it’s supermoon versus eclipse! For over an hour, the supermoon — a full moon occurring when the moon is closest in its orbit to Earth — will be blocked by our planet’s shadow in a total lunar eclipse. This hasn’t happened in more than 30 years. [NASA]

13 minutes, 22 seconds
In a valiant effort to dispel the Curse of the Billy Goat, five Chicago Cubs fans — who are also competitive eaters — devoured a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds. The Cubs will likely play the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League wild-card game on Oct. 7. [Wall Street Journal]

20 percent
During his first visit to the United States, Pope Francis exhorted bishops to help priests devote more time to caring for their parishioners’ spiritual needs. But that might be difficult: 20 percent of parishes have no priest in residence, wrote my colleague Leah Libresco. That number is up from about 5 percent just 30 years ago. [FiveThirtyEight]

360 pounds of cocaine
It’s fall! That means pumpkin spice lattes and decorative gourd season. But some gourds have been used for something else. Officials discovered 360 pounds of cocaine, worth more than $6 million, in a shipment of pumpkins and squash arriving at the Port of Philadelphia. It was the eighth-largest cocaine seizure at the port ever. [Associated Press]

At least 717 people
A stampede during Islam’s annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca killed at least 717 people and left more than 850 injured. The stampede happened less than two weeks after a crane crashed into Mecca’s Grand Mosque, killing more than 100 people. [New York Times]

$5,679
Singer Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass” has been played 178 million times on music streaming services. But the song’s co-writer, Kevin Kadish, says he’s received just $5,679 as a result. That works out to $0.00003 per stream. [Quartz]

7,000 cops
Pope Francis is currently in New York City. And he’s not traveling alone. At least 7,000 New York Police Department officers will be on duty for the visit. There will be “a lot of overtime,” Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said. [New York Daily News]

2 million refugees
Turkey has taken in 2 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees and spent $7.6 billion to care for them — but they can’t stay. They are not allowed to seek asylum, and work permits are hard to obtain. Many plan to risk their lives to get to Greece, according to experts. [NPR]

Nearly 2 years
Two Al Jazeera journalists — Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed — were pardoned and released from prison nearly two years after being arrested in Egypt. The journalists had been accused of aiding the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Their release came just before the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, traditionally a time of charity and clemency. [CNN]

4 balls
Houston Astros outfielder Preston Tucker walked after being thrown four balls in a game against the Los Angeles Angels. Totally unremarkable and utterly unworthy of this venerable column — save for the fact that it took a call to New York and about three minutes to get him to first base. Home plate umpire Ted Barrett had lost track of the count. When nothing happened after ball four, Houston manager A.J. Hinch challenged, and a video review ensued. [Deadspin]

4 states
Pity those from New York, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire and American Samoa (your pitiful columnist included). Starting in 2016, residents of those places will no longer be able to use their driver licenses to fly domestically. Getting a license in those places doesn’t require proof of citizenship or residency, so they’ve been deemed “noncompliant” with the Real ID Act. Now, where did I put my passport? [Travel + Leisure]

4.6 million people tuned in to watch Donald Trump on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Tuesday, a 46 percent increase from the previous Tuesday. The more than 300 million Americans who didn’t tune in? Losers. [Deadline Hollywood]

Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have broken the distance record for quantum teleportation, transporting quantum information over 60 miles. It’s a possible step toward a quantum Internet. Now if they could only teleport me to the office today to avoid the papal traffic. C’mon, guys — it’s only 10 miles. [Gizmodo]

150 people

5.6 million sets of fingerprints
In July, we learned that hackers had stolen about a million sets of fingerprints from the federal Office of Personnel Management. Turns out the hackers had their hands in a lot more — hands. On Wednesday, the government revealed that the number of federal employees whose fingerprints were stolen was actually 5.6 million. [The New York Times]

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo fractured his collarbone Sunday in a game against the Eagles and is expected to be out for at least two months. Dallas is down both Romo and star receiver Dez Bryant, the Eagles are a sinking ship of Theseus, New York is incapable of understanding the finite nature of time, and Washington is 1-1.

11.5 percent
Rich kids and poor kids get about the same share of their calories from eating fast food: 11.5 percent for children ages 2 to 19 from households with lower incomes and 13 percent for those from households with higher ones. In the end, an affinity for partially hydrogenated soybean oil, mechanically separated chicken, pasteurized cheese product and high fructose corn syrup brings this nation together regardless of our backgrounds. [Bloomberg]

12 Emmys
HBO’s “Game of Thrones” has made Emmy history, with a record 12 wins in one year: eight at the creative technical awards and an additional four at the main show on Sunday night. The previous record-holder was “The West Wing” with nine. The other big winner of the night was miniseries “Olive Kitteridge,” also from HBO. [MTV]

15 percent
Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is enjoying a postdebate surge in the polls. In a new CNN/ORC poll that was taken in the three days after the most recent Republican presidential debate, Fiorina received 15 percent, which put her in second place, behind Donald Trump. Earlier this month, she had been polling at 3 percent. [Politico]

More than $100,000
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential campaign may have hit a bump. In the same CNN/ORC poll that had Carly Fiorina at 15 percent, he received less than 1 percent of the vote. This is bad news in light of the revelation last week that the Republican’s campaign owes several vendors “more than $100,000.” [The Associated Press]

87 players
As part of the effort to understand the effects that a career in football can have on the brain, 91 former players, many of whom suspected they had suffered from traumatic head injuries, donated their brains to researchers for testing after their deaths. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University have announced that 87 of those former players had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. [ESPN]

The U.S. will admit up to 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017, up 15,000 from a cap of 85,000 in 2016. The cap is 70,000 in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The increase is due in part to the commitment from the Obama administration to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees. [The Washington Post]

$4.5 million
The National Zoo has received an additional $4.5 million from philanthropist David Rubenstein for panda conservation. The news comes after the recent birth of a cub at the zoo. Pandas — as far as I can ascertain from reading lots of news reports about them — require a gigantic pile of American currency to mate successfully in captivity. Reminder that pandas had little trouble having sex without humanity’s financial aid and that the only reason we had to turn our National Zoo into an Ailuropoda love shack is rampant deforestation and the systematic annihilation of their natural environment.

8 minutes 29 seconds
We’re still talking abut the GOP debate? Sure, I guess we are. By NPR’s reckoning, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had the least speaking time of any candidate, with only 8 minutes 29 seconds in what was essentially a three-hour affair. Needless to say, Walker aides are not thrilled that their candidate — who is doing decently in the polls — was largely overlooked on national television. [POLITICO]

12-point net unfavorable
Mayor Bill De Blasio is not doing well in favorability polls, even among New York City residents. A Quinnipiac poll found 49 percent of New Yorkers had an unfavorable opinion of the mayor, and only 37 percent of NYC respondents had a favorable opinion. [Quinnipiac University]

Last week, the Tennessee Titans crushed the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 42-14. Tennessee’s win gave them the 13th-largest opening weekend bump in the Super Bowl era, according to the Elo power rating system. [FiveThirtyEight]

20th member
On Thursday, Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois was sworn in to the U.S. House of Representatives, making this week the first time that the House has had a full 435 members since the beginning of the session. LaHood is the son of former Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, himself a former congressman. The younger Rep. LaHood is the 20th member of the current House of Representatives who is a child of a former member. Remember, kids, anything is possible if you follow your dreams, but it’s a lot more possible if your dad had the job you want. [@GregGiroux]

6,000
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is very good at showing up to votes; on Thursday the senator was recognized for attending her 6,000th consecutive vote. There are two senators who have cast even more in a row: sitting Sen. Chuck Grassley and late Sen. William Proxmire. [National Journal]

11,000 feet
On Thursday NASA released pictures from the New Horizons probe’s Pluto flyby. The terrain of the ex-planet is studded with glaciers and icy mountains that are up to 11,000 feet high. [NASA]

£100,000
A U.K. wine bar served an 18-year old woman a shot of alcohol containing liquid nitrogen in 2012, which led to the victim needing to have her ruptured stomach removed. This week the bar — Oscar’s Wine Bar in Lancaster— was fined £100,000 over the failure to ensure the safety of the cocktail. [BBC]

260 million years old
Bunostegos akokanensis is a pre-reptile life form that lived on land 260 million years ago. A new analysis of the creature’s bones led researchers to conclude that the Permian-era animal is the earliest known to stand upright on all four legs. [Science Daily]

5 games
Since the end of the Bush administration, Washington’s football team has only been above average for five games, according to a new history of the NFL that my colleagues put together. That’s just one of countless ways you can insult division rivals thanks to our new mathematical system. Dallas, your team exemplified mediocrity in American sports from 2010 through 2014 and I now have the stats to prove it. [FiveThirtyEight]

5 hours, 20 minutes
Approximate number of hours that Republican debates took last night, with the first debate starting around 6 p.m. eastern and the finale wrapping up in the ballpark of 11:20 p.m. If you’re a political junkie or a masochist or probably both, be sure to read FiveThirtyEight’s coverage of both debates. [FiveThirtyEight]

15-foot wave
A magnitude 8.3 earthquake in central Chile led to 15-foot waves in the city of Coquimbo. One million people have been evacuated in Chile, and the earthquake has also led to a tsunami advisory for the southern coast of California. [The Los Angeles Times]

40 times as much
A presidential primary debate is great for ratings, and in advance of last night’s congested affair CNN was reportedly making bank selling commercial time. Fox News’s debate was the ninth most-watched cable news broadcast ever, and in anticipation of sky-high viewership CNN was reportedly charging 40 times its normal advertising rate. If you saw a 30-second spot last night, it cost the advertiser somewhere from $150,000 to $200,000. [Marketplace]

82 percent
McDonalds has been complicating its menu in order to compete with new fast casual chains, and while there have been some successes for the company they’ve angered the franchisees who run 82 percent of the chain’s restaurants. I respect you all too much to unleash an “I’m hatin’ it” joke. [Bloomberg]

€136.20
Yale University has in its possession a 1,000 guilder bond that was issued on goatskin by de Stichtse Rijnlanden, the Dutch water authority, in 1648. Yale will receive 136.20 euros in interest from the bond this year. How many other pieces of goatskin are still moneymakers? [Bloomberg]

11,000
Approximate number of Super PAC ads that have aired for the 2016 GOP presidential election as of Monday. About 90 percent of them specifically targeted Iowa and New Hampshire, which will briefly be important in the national conversation for some time early next year before ebbing away. Then they’ll go back to being either that state we get corn from or the one our libertarian weed dealer moved to after college. [The Center for Public Integrity]

A new study published in the journal “Nature” estimates that there are 3 million premature deaths worldwide resulting from air pollution. As someone who lives in New Jersey and downwind from a coal plant, all I have to say is holy crap I need to move. [The Washington Post]

Microsoft announced plans to invest $75 million over three years in computer science education for kids. It might want to start in Irving, Texas, where it seems like the cops and school administrators can’t tell an etch-a-sketch from an iPad. [USA Today]

$1.3 billion
The Department of Justice approved Expedia’s acquisition of travel booking site Orbitz Wednesday following an anti-trust investigation. Expedia will buy Orbitz for $1.3 billion, making the combined company the largest in its sector. [Reuters]

0.8 percent
Tonight CNN is broadcasting the second debate of the GOP primary, and there will be 11 candidates on one stage. But prior to that debate, we get another undercard! Rick Santorum, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. Lindsay Graham, Jim Gilmore and George Pataki will have a smaller debate broadcast beforehand. Rick Santorum is dominating  that pack with a staggering 0.8 percent support, according to CNN’s average. [The Washington Post]

4th lowest
The arctic sea ice situation is not great. The National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that there were 1.7 million square miles of ice up north last week, the lowest this summer. That’s down 240,000 square miles from last year, and the fourth-lowest level on record. The all-time low occurred in 2012, when Earth had only 1.3 million square miles of ice. I have some ideas on how to fix this, but all of them are from that documentary “Frozen” (2013) so I may not actually be super helpful on this one. [Associated Press]

74 percent
Kim Davis’s hasn’t done many favors for “religious liberty.” After the Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal all over the country, 49 percent of respondents to an AP poll said officials with religious objections shouldn’t be forced to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Now, after Kim Davis picked her hill to jail on, an ABC News poll found that 74 percent of respondents said that equality should win out. [Slate]

85 percent
Percentage of parents of high-school aged kids who said that computer science courses were just as, or more, important than classes like math, science, history and English, according to a new survey from Gallup and Google. [Quartz]

That’s the nationwide increase in calls to poison control hotlines about kids younger than 12 drinking alcoholic hand sanitizer. [CNN]

690 people
A new case of Ebola claimed a life in Sierra Leone, leading the Ebola Response Centre to put the 690 people who lived in the same village as the victim into isolation for three weeks. Sierra Leone was one of the nations to suffer most from the disease’s outbreak in December 2013, and was considered Ebola-free last month. [Thomson Reuters]

2,159
That’s how many CNN reports have focused on Donald Trump since he announced his intention to run for president, roughly double that of Jeb Bush and more than 5 times as many as Ted Cruz. Give the people what they want, you know? [The Wall Street Journal]

30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is splitting up, and up to 30,000 layoffs were announced at HP Enterprise, one of the forthcoming sibling companies. Prior to the layoffs, there were about 252,000 workers moving to the new company. [Associated Press]

91,000 cans
Do you like Metallica, Budweiser, and Canada? Well buckle up for the greatest promotion of your lifetime. The Metallica logo will appear on roughly 91,000 cans of Budweiser that have been canned after feeling the vibrations of Metallica themselves. A tanker truck of the swill will be parked outside a Canadian arena where Metallica is playing, and the beer will be canned only after it soaks up all that metal. [The AV Club]

Saturday September 12 was technically the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. That may come as a surprise to those paying attention since there were zero hurricanes in the northern hemisphere this weekend. That’s the first time that we’ve had a storm-less peak in 38 years. [Science News]

Donald Trump uses an iPhone. But @realDonaldTrump doesn’t always tweet from one. An in-depth investigation of the GOP frontrunner’s tweets from April 23 through Sept. 14 has found that — given his iPhone usage — at most only 3 percent of his 3,197 tweets were offered by Trump’s own gilded thumbs. [Mother Jones]

33 percent
Ta-Nehisi Coates is out with a fantastic essay on mass incarceration and the impact it has had on the black American family. It’s packed with fascinating stats, but most striking to me was the data on parole: In 1984, 70 percent of parolees were not arrested during their parole period and obtained full freedom. By 1996, that number crashed to 44 percent, and in 2013 it was 33 percent. [The Atlantic]

400 kilograms
Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic will increase the power of the rockets it uses to deliver things to space, allowing the company to transport up to 400 kg of payload to low earth orbit. People won’t be going into orbit — yet — but communications satellites will, and those come with lucrative contracts. [The Washington Post]

$433.24
The National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. — which is far cooler than it sounds, believe me — recently wrapped up an art installation comprised of a giant ball pit in the middle of the museum. Following the cleanup, the National Building Museum had recovered $433.24 worth of American legal tender lost in the ball pit. [The Washington Post]

1310
The year of a court document containing what may be the first use of the word “fuck” in a sexual context in the English language, according to a researcher at Keele University. It is a person named “Roger Fuckebythenavele,” a truly lamentable name in any period. [Quartz]

$3 million
How much money the National Pork Board pays every year to license the slogan, “The other white meat,” from the National Pork Producers Council. That seems like a lot for a slogan, but it seems like far too much when accounting for the fact that the National Pork Board stopped using that slogan in 2011. The current slogan for America’s pork farmers is “Pork: Be Inspired.” [POLITICO]

$99,999,999
After installing new check processing equipment, the IRS is now unable to process any check that exceeds $99,999,999. Assuming you are profoundly in debt to the IRS, the agency now requests you either wire the money or send multiple checks. [The Associated Press]

$113 million
The former U.S. Consulate in Mumbai was sold to India’s eighth richest man for $113 million, the largest ever residential real estate purchase in the nation. The U.S. had a 999 year lease on the property since 1957 and has been itching to get out of it since 2011. You read that right. I’ve love to hear more about how we got into a thousand year lease on the Indian seaside. [Quartz]

Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the U.S. Open final Sunday night, his third Grand Slam singles title this year. As my colleagues Benjamin Morris and Carl Bialik will tell you, the rivalry between these two is among the best ever. [ESPN]

23 days off
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is running for president and his son, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, is helping him. Seems reasonable. But George hasn’t been at his job much as a result: In the first 50 days after his father announced he was running for election, Bush the Younger has been outside of Texas or off work for a cumulative 23 of them, a Houston Chronicle investigation found. [The Houston Chronicle]

Jeremy Corbyn, a left-wing member of the U.K. Labour party, won 59.5 percent of the vote to become the new party leader. Corbyn focused on inequality and poverty in the leadership election. [BBC]

A fire ravaging Lake County in California is, as of last night, not at all contained and has claimed 75 square miles worth of territory. Upwards of 1,300 people evacuated Middletown. [Los Angeles Times]

93.7 percent
The NFL’s new rule attempting to make extra point attempts harder — by moving the kick back to 32 yards — seems to have succeeded in making the point after a touchdown less of a certainty. Last year, teams scored the extra point 99.3 percent of the time, which is super boring. Yesterday afternoon, there were 63 attempts and 4 misses, which gives us a 93.7 percent success rate. Sure, it’s a single day and small sample size, but it’s a good sign for the league. [Deadspin]

140,000 saigas
Saiga are super-endangered herbivores that look like a camel got funky with a deer. Last May, about 140,000 of them dropped dead over the course of several days. While the exact cause of the die-off remains a mystery, researchers were able to determine that a bacteria that lives in their intestinal tract is involved in some way with the collapse of their immune system. As someone who personally has lots of bacteria in his intestinal tract and also has an immune system, this is horrifying. [The Observer]

2.8 million
Heavy flooding in the eastern region of Japan has led the Fire and Disaster Management Agency to advise 2.8 million people to evacuate. It’s the end of the rainy season and the rain has been nonstop in parts of the country. [CNN]

$25.6 million
“The Visit,” the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan — whose directorial career has been in a bit of a death spiral — took $25.6 million this past weekend at the box office, which for a $5 million movie is pretty good, all things considered. The movie fell to second place behind “The Perfect Guy,” but it’s nice to see Shyamalan pull off the first step of a comeback. [Box Office Mojo]

Despite antibiotic treatments, that’s the fatality rate of people infected with Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes plague. Yes, plague, that thing that apparently still exists. Also, military labs may have mislabeled, improperly stored or shipped infectious plague samples, which has led to a moratorium on research since Sept. 2. Have a nice weekend! [USA Today]

Probability of winning the Super Bowl for Seattle and New England, according to the newly unleashed FiveThirtyEight Elo NFL predictions model. New England’s win over Pittsburgh last night bumped the Patriots’ chances up from 14 percent to 15 percent. If your team is in the low probabilities in the model, be sure to tweet “So you’re saying there’s a chance” to my colleagues on the viz team. I know from last year that they love that.

The number of people since Sept. 4 who have been hospitalized because of Salmonella infections, the most recent victims in an outbreak linked to cucumbers that is believed to have affected hundreds. That’s right, we have more horrifying bacteria news today in Significant Digits. Tell your friends, it’s a great newsletter. The NIH recommends cleaning utensils and surfaces, cooking food and refrigerating perishables to prevent the disease. I recommend consuming cucumbers only in the form of picklebacks and tzatziki sauce. Not for health reasons or anything, just because they kind of suck otherwise. [TIME]

Lots of companies are adopting models to closely track employee performance. Do people love being ruthlessly tracked by corporate overlords who monitor their every move to extract every modicum of shareholder value from them? Nah. But the thing is, it works: In some restaurant chains that adopted a close employee monitoring system, weekly revenue rose by $2,975. [FiveThirtyEight]

[Gotham Gazette]

$50,000
Daniel Craig, who plays James Bond, gave nearly $50,000 to an organization he believed was supporting the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Unfortunately for Craig, the Super PAC has failed to file campaign finance disclosures, is disavowed by Sanders himself and is run by a man wanted on two warrants in the state of Arizona. Well, [sips martini] M always said Bond was reckless with Moneypenny [speeds off in Aston Martin, sends spec script to MGM]. [The Center for Public Integrity]

7 same-sex marriage licenses
With Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis busted out of the clink in Kentucky, part of the terms of her release was that she would not interfere with the issuing of marriage licenses anymore. In her absence, 10 licenses were issued, seven of them to same-sex couples, the latter being her particular gripe. Deputy Clerk Brian Mason said he would continue issuing the marriage licenses, regardless of what Davis had to say about it. And thus, social progress was made. [The Lexington Herald-Leader]

At least 10 CIA officers
In the course of research for “Zero Dark Thirty,” the film about the killing of Osama bin Laden, at least 10 CIA National Clandestine Service officers met with director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal to punch up the script, new documents obtained by Vice reveal. Ironically, the film lost the 2012 Academy Award for Best Picture to “Argo,” a movie about CIA officers punching up a movie script in service to a clandestine operation. [Vice]

$20 per ounce
A sales-tax holiday in Colorado means that the state will be forced to suspend taxes on recreational marijuana for one day Sept. 16, which will make that libertarian stoner you knew in college who moved out to Telluride super thrilled. This amounts to about $20 off the price of a medium-quality ounce of marijuana in Denver. This is the worst thing to happen to the War on Drugs since decades of failure. [SFGate]

According to a new poll, the percentage of Americans who could imagine a scenario in which they would support a U.S. military coup of the federal government, which is all kinds of messed up. Seriously, guys? Broken down by party identification, this included 43 percent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats, which is still far too high if you ask me. Those of you in favor, watch the documentary series “Battlestar Galactica” and tell me if you stand by your position. [YouGov]

Percentage of Bloomberg LP’s revenue derived from the Bloomberg terminal, a financial research and industry communication tool that costs a lot of money but is pretty much necessary in vast numbers for the operation of a modern financial institution.

Apple also announced a TV product that has many things other TV products have and — golly! — a new iPhone. Killing the game, Apple. [Reuters]

7,795 milligrams
Sodium content in a Jersey Mike’s Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak (with white giant bread), one of the highest-sodium dishes you can get in New York City. For reference, the FDA-recommended daily limit is 2,300 mg. The city’s Board of Health approved a rule requiring chain stores to flag products with high sodium by Dec. 1, presumably ruining future visits to Taco Bell that once brought beefy five-layer contentment after a hard day.

Percentage of people with student debt exceeding $100,000 who default on that debt, which is the lowest default rate of any debt bracket: Students who owe $1,000 to $5,000 in debt, for example, default on those loans 34 percent of the time. One cause of this disparity is that people with more college debt are likelier to have higher-paying jobs. [Fusion]

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wrote about his tax plan in The Wall Street Journal, highlighting intentions to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent if he’s elected president. He also would assess a one-time 8.75 percent tax on the $2 trillion in corporate assets held overseas by U.S. companies. Boilerplate language about simplifying the tax code is also a prominent element of the plan. [The Wall Street Journal]

An NBC News/Marist poll of Democratic voters in New Hampshire found that 41 percent would support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were the election held that day, 9 points more than Hillary Clinton. This poll included Vice President Joe Biden in the mix, who with 16 percent support played a bit of a spoiler in the matchup. But, uh, Feel The Bern? [Reuters]

A “superhenge” that makes Stonehenge look like a bunch of Lincoln Logs someone left on a playground has been found nearly 2 miles south of the famous site, 3 feet underground. The arrangement — which, come on, we’re talking some big rocks here, not anything really that mind-blowing — is an estimated 4,500 years old. I’m sure you could go and check out the 3-D visualizations cooked up to portray it, but seriously, we are just talking about some rocks. [BBC]

99 counties
It’s trendy for presidential aspirants to attempt “The Full Grassley,” a tour of all 99 Iowa counties named after Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. In past election cycles, Rick Santorum and John Edwards enjoyed success at the Iowa caucuses after completing the Grassley, but Michele Bachmann didn’t. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced that he intends to complete the task. [The New York Times]

946 Mediterranean cypress trees
After a devastating fire swept through a 50,000-acre experimental tree site in 2012, a pair of scientist brothers found that the Mediterranean cypress is functionally fireproof, given that almost 1,000 of them survived. Now they’re trying to see if the trees can be planted as a fire barrier in forests. [Washington Post]

20,000 refugees

Potential sales of Star Wars merch in 2016, according to a market research report. Friday was “Force Friday,” a made-up holiday where a bunch of Star Wars stuff went on sale. From a numbers perspective, Star Wars is a very successful toy franchise that happens to make movies every now and again.

0 games suspended
NFL Commissioner and [expletives redacted] Roger Goodell’s decision to suspend New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has been overruled. Goodell, ever the senator’s son, pledged to fight this as far as it will go, but the long and short of it for now is that Brady will play in Week 1. This is, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, a rather big deal for the Patriots. [CNBC]

8 percent
Percentage of those ages 18 to 34 who identified themselves as members of the Greatest Generation in a Pew survey, to which I say damn right. Are people in that age range typically described as “millennials”? Sure. But let’s get a couple of things straight. First, naming generations is a pseudoscience developed by charlatans with peculiar and frankly stupid notions of generational predestination. Second, any society that has convinced itself that its greatest generation has past — and do not get me wrong, they were awesome — dooms itself to decline. Third, naming a new generation before its finest hour is an act of desperation that the dying prosecute on the ascending. Are 18- to 34-year-olds millennials? Maybe. Are they the greatest generation? Give us a few years to find out. Kudos to the 8 percent who think they already know. [Pew Research Center]

Google Chrome is a busy web browser from a processing standpoint, with each individual tab constituting its own process. This means that the browser runs a lot slower when a lot of tabs are open. Google is rolling out an update that reduces each page’s memory use by 10 percent, something that could have a huge effect for people like me who still have tabs open from literally weeks ago. [The Verge]

33 percent
Polling for the New Democratic Party of Canada, according to the CBC. Canadians vote on Oct. 19, and right now Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative Party is lagging behind the NDP with 29 percent support. [Bloomberg]

52 years
Yesterday, my colleague Jody Avirgan — host of our fantastic What’s The Point podcast — spent the day on the New York City subway system, traveling 154 miles in almost 14 hours all over the city in pursuit of the longest continuous non-redundant subway trip. I bring this up because Jody is a madman, as apparently the New York City subway system is so decrepit and in need of infrastructure overhauls that one analysis estimates the work will take 52 years to complete. [New York Daily News]

84-hour work week
A metals company in Pittsburgh hired a staffing firm to put out the worst Craigslist ad ever, seeking replacement labor to work 84-hour weeks paying $1,700 to $3,000. Allegheny Technologies is currently in a contract dispute with employees stretching into its third week and desperately needs workers to cross the picket line to work 12-hour shifts. [Quartz]

$125,000
A Peoria, Illinois, resident whose home was raided by police after running a Twitter account parodying the city’s mayor has settled a civil rights lawsuit for $125,000. I worry I’m reading this as “You can make money by annoying the right elected officials on the Internet” more than I probably should. [Ars Technica]

$14 million
Approximate amount spent on TV advertising by Republican campaigns and allies thus far in the election cycle. Is that a lot of money? Sure. But an estimated $4.4 billion will be spent on this election, so take this as a standard reminder that the race has barely begun. [FiveThirtyEight]

$500 million
Reported cash offer to Elemental Technologies, a mobile video company, from Amazon in an acquisition bid. Should that number bear out, it’ll be the fifth-largest Amazon acquisition ever. [Forbes]

3 correspondents
While all eyes have been on the debut of Stephen Colbert at the “Late Show,” the “Daily Show” with Trevor Noah added three new correspondents. Ronny Chieng, Desi Lydic and Roy Wood Jr. are joining “The Best F#@king News Team Ever.” [Gothamist]

5 bears
Five polar bears have captured a team of scientists in Russia. The bears are, according to CNN, “hungry” and blocking two meteorologists and an engineer from leaving a weather station. It has come to a point where the team is begging the Russian government for equipment to scare the bears away. Get a camera there. Get a camera there right now, CNN. I will watch a team of unhappy researchers try to evade bears for far longer than your coverage of that plane. [CNN]

15.6 percent
According to a survey of Harvard freshmen, the percentage of the incoming class who are the first in their families to go to college. That said, a whopping 16.8 percent of the Harvard freshman class had one or more parents who went to Harvard, and 27.8 percent overall reported some relative had attended the school. [The Crimson]

71 percent
At 71 percent, Japan has the highest median favorability rating of nine Asia-Pacific nations in a public opinion survey of the region. China enjoys a 57 percent favorability rating. North Korea was not surveyed, though, so take this with a grain of salt, I suppose. [Pew Research Center]

194
The number of laboratories to which the military accidentally sent live samples of the anthrax virus — substantially higher than originally stated. Are you worried that some of that live bioweapon was accidentally sent to a lab in your state? Well, fret no longer, because now we know that yes, live anthrax was indeed sent to every single state. Also Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Whoops. [Military.com]

250 million kilometers
The Tajik state news agency announced this week that a nearby planet — 250 million kilometers away from Earth and located between Mars and Jupiter — had been named after Tajikistan. But no such thing was done by any international body, and the alleged planet most likely doesn’t exist. The “International Astrophysicists Union” that reportedly named the planet certainly does not exist. I worry that we’ve stumbled on a bit of a Russell’s teapot situation here. [Calvert Journal]

4,200 people
Italy and Greece are struggling to deal with an influx of migrants, with two new ships carrying more than 4,200 people arriving in Greece yesterday. The Dublin Regulation holds that refugees seeking asylum in the European Union must apply in the first country they set foot in. Since Italy and Greece are, geographically speaking, pretty obviously on the Mediterranean, they’ve seen some of the largest influxes of people seeking asylum from the Syrian civil war. [BBC]

66 percent
Percentage of the construction toys market controlled by Lego last year. The company reported favorable earnings yesterday and is still apparently seeing growth as a result of last year’s “The Lego Movie.” [Bloomberg]

$5 million
Damages sought in a lawsuit by Harris Faulkner, a Fox News host, from Hasbro, which makes the Littlest Pet Shop line of toys. The line includes a plastic hamster named Harris Faulkner that the television personality claims resembles her likeness. In some personal news, I probably need to disclose my forthcoming suit against the My Little Pony line of toys over its “Colt Hickey” toy, which as “the pony that drinks too much and doesn’t shave as often as he should” has unfairly appropriated my likeness and personal brand. [The Guardian]

10 million tapes
As a millennial, it’s my obligation to say, “Golly, what’s a cassette tape, haha?” here, but I’m going to skip that and just get to the meat: There is not only a company that still manufactures audio cassette tapes, but it’s also making a mint doing so. National Audio Company sold 10 million tapes last year and sales are up 20 percent this year. Music cassettes account for about 70 percent of their sales. There is life after disruption by tech startups, it seems. [Bloomberg]

CORRECTION (Sept. 3, 10:58 a.m.): An earlier version of an item in this article misstated the distance of an alleged planet allegedly named after the country Tajikistan. It is allegedly 250 miles away from Earth, not 250 kilometers. It still definitely doesn’t exist.
CORRECTION (Sept. 3, 2:25 p.m.): This is what happens when we write about fake planets. A previous correction to an item in this article again misstated the distance of an alleged planet allegedly named after the country Tajikistan. It is — fictionally — 250 million kilometers from Earth, not 250 miles.

4 designs

New Zealand is entertaining the idea of changing up its flag. The government received 10,000 design submissions, but only four remain in the running. Three of them feature a silver fern, which today I learned is a treasured symbol of New Zealand iconography. The flags will go before a popular referendum in November using the delightful ranked-preference voting methodology. The winner of that contest will go head to head with the current flag in a second referendum in March. This is probably the single greatest event in vexillology in years. [New Zealand Herald]


11.3 percent

While women own 36.2 percent of businesses, women-owned firms make only 11.3 percent of the revenue, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data. A similar disparity exists for minority-owned businesses. [Pew Research Center]


16.6 percent
Percentage of the U.S. advertising market that will be spent on mobile digital ads in 2015, up 59 percent over last year. Spending on mobile ads is expected to surpass desktop and print advertising this year. [Wall Street Journal]

23rd
Facebook’s new anti-spam algorithm was built in the programming language Haskell. This probably means nothing to you, but Haskell is the 23rd most commonly used language on GitHub, which is to say it’s pretty uncommon.  Calling Haskell “esoteric” isn’t exactly right, but it’s a pretty deep cut on the programming language front. The main reason for the selection is that Haskell is good at running multiple functions simultaneously, useful for Facebook in fighting lots and lots of spam across billions of messages. [Wired]


$30

Comcast, ever innovating, is trying out a new $30 fee that will allow Florida customers to surpass an arbitrary 300 GB monthly data usage limit. This isn’t some scheme to reduce the load on Comcast’s network: The company said the current cap is business-related, not technical. [Ars Technica]


44 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe prostitution should be legal, according to a YouGov poll released Tuesday. About 50 percent of Democrats compared to 34 percent of Republicans support legalizing the world’s oldest profession. [YouGov]

102 courts
U.S. Tennis has been eclipsed in recent years by other countries, but the solution of “throw a bunch of money at the problem until it’s fixed” has actually gone pretty well. Team USA is opening a $60 million training facility in Florida with 102 courts, a substantial upgrade from the eight courts at its current facility. [The New York Times]

381

Wikipedia axed 381 editor accounts believed to have accepted pay in exchange for editing articles to promote customers. [Motherboard]

14,300 restaurants
CNBC broke the greatest story of my lifetime yesterday with the announcement that McDonald’s franchisees voted to serve all-day breakfast. The change will occur at about 14,300 restaurants. Please alert Donald Trump that his run for the presidency has been an unmitigated success — we have made America truly great again. The change goes into effect Oct. 6. [CNBC]

$500,000
The News Guild, a union that has traditionally focused on newspaper employees, is investing $500,000 in an effort to unionize digital newsrooms. Recently, employees of Gawker and Vice Media have voted to join the rival union Writers Guild of America-East. [Politico Media]

1 paid staffer

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential campaign appears to be in dire straits: His polling numbers are negligible (they’re in rounding-error territory) and according to reports from Perry aides, he’s down to a single paid staffer in the entire state of Iowa. Basically barring a huge turnaround, Perry is that kid from “The Hunger Games” who fell for the ol’ “big pile of shiny weapons” trick in the first five minutes. [USA Today]


2.1 percent

Increase in revenue collected in Colorado from alcohol excise taxes from June 2014 through May 2015. Reminder that Colorado legalized marijuana, so this is good news for a local alcohol industry worried that cannabis would cut into its market. So far at least, marijuana has not stopped the rest of the intoxicant industry from expanding. I don’t normally do calls to action here, but you really need to read this story if only to see the greatest use of the idiom “a high tide lifts all boats.” [The Guardian]

11 turnovers
Ladies and gentlemen who support the Washington NFL team, please allow me to re-introduce your starting quarterback: Kirk Cousins, who had 11 turnovers in five games last year. Apparently head coach Jay Gruden elected to sit anticipated starter Robert Griffin III for the first game of the year in favor of Cousins, despite urging from management to play RG3. [ESPN]

According to a new poll, the support among likely Iowa caucus-goers for GOP candidate Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon. Carson is tied with Donald Trump. [Monmouth University]


29 districts
For the first time ever, Singapore will have a two-or-more party contest in each of its 29 districts in an upcoming election. The politics of the city-state has been dominated by the unbroken rule of the People’s Action Party, but following the demise of the party’s longtime leader in March, other parties have seen an opportunity to compete. [Bloomberg]

75 percent
A proposed takeover bid of third-party travel booking site Orbitz by competitor Expedia could result in a company that controls about 75 percent of the domestic market in the field, according to research from Phocuswright. This potential deal has put hoteliers on notice, with many trying to find legal ways to attract and keep customers with factors other than price. [The New York Times]

80 percent

Efficiency of a Swiss “solar sunflower” design for solar energy collection. The apparatus, which kind of looks like a satellite dish hooked up to a disco ball, is able to produce 12kW of electricity and 21kW of thermal energy. It’s still pricier per watt than cheap solar cells, but its efficiency is intriguing — and it’s pretty to look at. [Ars Technica]


$100 gift cards
Jeep really, really wants to get recalled vehicles into the shop, and to make sure owners get around to bringing in their cars for necessary repairs, the company has resorted to giving out $100 gift cards. [Bloomberg]

500 calorie limit
A New York City council member wants to cap the nutritional intake on fast food children’s meals at 500 calories. I can see an argument in favor of that, sure, but Council Member Benjamin J. Kallos also wants to mess with the macronutrient composition of food by capping fat content. The last time the government tried to pull that off, things went pretty badly. [New York Observer]

1,279 career rushing attempts
The NFL’s oldest running back, Fred Jackson, was cut from the Buffalo Bills Monday after almost a decade with the team. Jackson, a fan favorite, was the top rusher for Buffalo last year. “F—ing Bills,” added local political reporter and Buffalo fan Harry Enten. “If they go 7-9 and cut Fred Jackson I will be so pissed,” Enten added in a late-night message.

A team of six NASA astronauts began a one-year isolation project in Hawaii to simulate a year on Mars without fresh air or privacy. I really hope Fox options this for a terrible reality show. [BBC]

3 times as likely

A new study found that British teenagers who identified with the Goth subculture at age 15 were three times as likely to be clinically depressed in their teen years as those who did not. [The Guardian]


4 months
An Australian man was released from a months-long detention after a substance in his possession originally believed to be methamphetamine turned out to just be Epsom salts. He was in the clink for four months before police finally got around to making sure the rocks were meth. If I were him, I would be so mad at the guy who sold me that “meth.” [The Independent]

Percentage of pop stars — a set of the 50 top-selling artists of each decade — from 1950 to 2014 who were born in the United States. The U.K. comes in at a far second, with 15.6 percent of the stars in the set. [CityLab]


118 years

President Obama approved an order from the Secretary of the Interior to rename the peak known as Mount McKinley for the last 118 years to its original Alaskan appellation, Denali. This has been an Alaska vs. Ohio fight for some time: the former — where the mountain is in fact located — has long fought to call the peak by its Koyukon Athabascan name, while the latter, where President William McKinley was born, has sought to nix the change. Obama — a guy who presumably gets non-contiguous states, being from Hawaii — finally approved the change. Also, Speaker John Boehner is ticked. [Alaska Dispatch News]

11,000 years
A wooden statue found in the peat bogs of Russia 125 years ago has just been dated to 11,000 years old, making it the oldest wooden artifact in the world. It’s covered in an encrypted code nobody can decipher, but scholars seem to think it contains the outlines of a belief system. [Yahoo News]

$108,000
About 850 vintage Atari games found in a landfill in New Mexico have sold for a total of $108,000 on eBay. The city of Alamogordo will get most of the funds, with $16,000 going to the local historical society. [CTV News]

$500,000
How much Major League Baseball paid for the domain MLB.com in 2000, in addition to six months of free advertising for the domain’s original owners, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. It’s been a steady fight in the following 15 years to nail down domain names for each of the league’s 30 franchises, and only three preferred domains remain out of MLB’s grasp: Giants.com, which is owned by the New York football team, Rays.com, owned by a Seattle restaurant, and Twins.com, which is a whole other story involving a pair of legitimate twins who refuse to sell. [Grantland]

“We Are Your Friends,” a movie about electronic dance music starring Zac Efron, had one of the worst wide-release openings ever, earning only $1.8 million from 2,333 screens this past weekend. [Variety]

Gerrymandering can backfire, moneyed elites: A redistricting plan accidentally left a single University of Missouri student as the sole registered voter in a community improvement district in Columbia, Missouri.

According to a survey of 20,000 U.S. service-members, 41 percent of women in the military have suffered sexual harassment. About 4 percent of men surveyed also reported they had been sexually harassed. [Reuters]

71 percent
A Billboard survey of music executives found that 71 percent of respondents thought the music streaming service Tidal would survive for one more year or less. This isn’t very encouraging for the Jay-Z helmed app. Then again, if there’s a group on the planet to trust less about technology than music industry executives, I’d love to meet them and introduce them to fire, rounded stones and pointed sticks. [Billboard]

103 points
Consumer Reports is typically a no-nonsense evaluator of products. But that fact made the magazine’s initial score for the Tesla Model S P85D, 103 out of a possible 100, raise some eyebrows. The test is broken! Consumer Reports eventually had to tweak their model, but does this mean the blender I bought that I thought scored a 65 actually did worse? [Forbes]

152 socks

Current record for number of socks worn on one foot. That seems like a dubious mark to enshrine. Nonetheless, Guinness wants to record it, and more importantly, someone was possessed to attempt such a record. What drives someone to break a dumb record? The motivations are all across the board.

$7.99
The future has finally arrived: Amazon Prime upgraded its one-hour delivery business in Seattle to include booze. If you need hooch in an hour, there’s a $7.99 delivery fee for Prime members. But if you can plan a little bit ahead (and you can make the mixers last), two-hour delivery is free. Here’s hoping they roll this service out nationwide within a few days, because rye reserves are running low at Echo Base (my apartment) and we’re doing a “Rick & Morty” marathon. [Grubstreet]

Twelve people have been arrested in connection with the explosion in the Chinese port city of Tianjin that killed at least 139 people. Several managers of the company storing the chemicals believed to have triggered the inferno were among those arrested. [NPR]

99 percent

According to a new survey from the CDC, that’s the percentage of contact lens users who reported at least one unsafe habit, ranging from sleeping while still wearing contacts to showering or swimming with them. Today I learned: I should stop showering and swimming in contacts. Also, apparently water with a splash of vodka is not a legitimate substitute for contact lens solution, so I may have bigger problems. [Minneapolis Post]

Thomson Reuters suffered a reply-all apocalypse on Wednesday, when an employee named Vince accidentally sent an email that wound its way, through a catastrophic series of reply-alls, to 33,000 inboxes across the company. Remember, “please remove me from this email chain” only makes the problem worse, or from a one perspective (mine) vastly more interesting. [The Wall Street Journal]

Jorge Ramos, the anchor of Noticiero Univision, was thrown out of a Donald Trump press conference Tuesday after asking the real estate developer about his immigration policies. On Wednesday, Joe Scarborough — another foe of Trump — said Ramos was seeking 15 minutes of fame. Why is this hilarious? Scarborough helms MSNBC’s Morning Joe, which averages between 400,000 and 500,000 viewers. Noticiero Univision has, on average, about 2 million viewers. [@alexweprin]

Fact: There is a conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is running for president to help Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Fact: A new genealogical analysis has found that Clinton and Trump are 19th cousins, with shared 18th great grandparents, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Katherine Swynford, Duchess of Lancaster. Does this mean there is a conspiracy and that it’s been in the works for over 600 years? I’m just asking questions here. [The Hill]

Twitter has chosen sides in the battle between privileged political elites and nonprofit government watchdogs, shutting down a service that monitored the Twitter accounts of politicians in 30 countries for deleted tweets. An example of how this was useful: Recently, Politwoops found several U.S. government officials deleting tweets supporting Bowe Bergdahl shortly before going on to criticize him as a traitor (and President Obama for negotiating his release).

5 Hugos

The 2015 Hugo Awards were given out over the weekend. Well, most of them were. No award was given out in five categories. The “no awards” were the result of a campaign to vote as a group for more white and male authors, and a counter-campaign — led by the likes of no less than George R.R. Martin. The “no award” in five categories is the same number of “no awards” given in the entire history of the Hugos. [The Guardian]

218 Anakins
In the year 2014, there were 218 babies born that were named “Anakin,” according to the official list released by the Social Security Administration.

Safeway, which owns the defunct supermarket Dominick’s, owes Michael Jordan $8.9 million for using his name and likeness to shill products without his authorization. Safeway was hoping to pay only about $126,900, and Jordan’s people wanted about $10 million, so this is a pretty clean win for Jordan. [ESPN]


$298.5 million
Estimated payroll of the Los Angeles Dodgers after the acquisition of Chase Utley from the Philadelphia Phillies. That puts the Dodgers $1.5 million short of being baseball’s first $300 million payroll, a figure that may very well be hit following end-of-season bonuses. [ESPN]

$578 million
One of what I imagine will be many class-action lawsuits against the group behind Ashley Madison was filed on behalf of Canadians implicated in the stolen data breach, with lawyers seeking $578 million. [The Guardian]


$738 million
That’s how much Elon Musk’s Tesla raised from a stock sale. The money is planned to fuel investments like a battery factory and a new car line. For the rest of us, this also means that Musk himself spent $20 million on stock, meaning he has $20 million less to spend on a super laser or volcano base or shark pit or whatever else potential supervillains are buying these days. [Fortune]

$182 billion
Global markets took a big hit last week, with the S&P 500 enduring its worst week since 2011. This took a bite out of the world’s 400 richest people, who lost a collective $182 billion. Still, I’m sure they’ll pull through: The top 400 still have about $3.98 trillion combined. [Bloomberg]

4-day workweek
Japanese retailer Uniqlo is trying out a four-day workweek for about 10,000 of its employees starting in October. This would mean three-day weekends, provided employees commit to longer hours during the week, Nate. [Bloomberg]

64
Tiger Woods had his best round of golf in two years, shooting a 6-under-par 64 at the Wyndham Championship. I assume it was a schadenfreude-fueled round of excellence after every other cheater got busted in the Ashley Madison leak. [The Guardian]

17 cases
Number of Guinea worm cases in the first five months of this year. Former President Jimmy Carter — who announced that he’s significantly paring back his travel to combat cancer — has made it one of his life’s goals to eradicate the parasite. Carter said at a news conference, “I hope the last Guinea worm dies before I do,” which is a great way to go out if I ever heard one. [Vox]

18 days
The pumpkin spice latte returns to Starbucks on Sept. 8. Get ready. As I walked through the sweltering bus terminal of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey this morning, sweating like a pig with the smell of garbage wafting through the air, I just knew that fall was right around the corner. [Refinery 29]


20 centimeters
The thickness of the glass on a planned street-spanning sky pool in London, presumably to be built so commuters can see your pasty, wealthy body as they just try to get through their day. It’ll be the first glass bridge pool connecting two apartment buildings across the street from each other, and might also be the first sign that the neighborhood has been gentrified. [The Guardian]


$120,000

Estimated cost of raising a ballerina, which includes $53,000 of ballet school tuition over 15 years, $32,000 on summer intensive programs, $29,000 on shoes and so on. Needless to say, ballet is a rich person’s art form because of the considerable expense involved. [FiveThirtyEight]


$140,000

The estimated value of having LeBron James tweet about your brand once. [ESPN]


28,443,856

The number of small businesses in the United States, which together employ about 56,062,893 workers. [Forbes]

$52 million 
How much Jennifer Lawrence made from June 2014 to June 2015, making her the highest-paid actress of the period. Still, this means that the pay gap between the highest-paid man and woman is $28 million, given that Robert Downey Jr. pulled in an estimated $80 million over the period. [AV Club]

$19.43 billion
How much the United Nations asked for to fund a response to humanitarian crises in Syria, South Sudan and Nepal this year. They’re only about a third of the way there. Have they considered calling the guy building the stupid pool in London? [The Guardian]

$525
The price of a 45-minute intravenous dose of the club drug ketamine at a clinic in New York City for the severely depressed and suicidal. In recent years, there has been a wave of doctors opening facilities that specialize in using the sedative pharmaceutical to remedy deep psychological pain in patients. [Bloomberg]

9 percent
“Deez Nuts” is, from a paperwork perspective, a legitimate independent candidate for the presidency — and is polling at 9 percent in North Carolina, according to a new Public Policy Polling survey. [Public Policy Polling]


1,078
Ever hear of p-hacking? It’s the process of narrowing or widening a data set to obtain a publishable scientific result. It’s common, and it’s surprisingly easy, as you’ll see in this FiveThirtyEight interactive graphic: Of 1,800 possible combinations of variables, 1,078 will yield a publishable result! [FiveThirtyEight]

3,173 percent
Each state has their preferred vice, and in New York, it’s the noble pickleback — a staunch shot of whiskey promptly followed by a sour, palate-cleansing shot of pickle juice. According to Foursquare, New Yorkers mention the shot-chaser combo 3,173 percent more than residents of other states. [Time Out New York]

$126,900

Michael Jordan is suing defunct grocery store chain Dominick’s over the use of his name to sell products. This has raised the question of what exactly “Michael Jordan,” the proper noun, is worth. It’s $126,900, according to an expert witness called by the chain in the civil trial. [The Chicago Tribune]

200,000
The approximate number of criminal truancy cases against children and parents in Texas in 2013. Starting next month, students in the Lone Star State will no longer face charges for playing hooky. And courts have to wipe the charges from students’ records. [The Texas Observer]


$220 million
The amount of money raised for ALS research through the ice bucket challenge, a funding campaign that went viral last year and is beginning to yield results. Money raised through the challenge helped support recently published research by Johns Hopkins scientists, who say their study is an important step toward finding a cure for or slowing the disease. [CBS News]

$538 million
The amount of revenue that the cosmetics company It Works! says it had last year. The multilevel-marketing company relies on a network of distributors using digital social networks like Facebook to recruit new customers. [Tech Insider]

274

The United Arab Emirates has the biggest gender imbalance in the world, with 274 men for every 100 women. That’s primarily due to the large numbers of male foreign workers who move to the country without their families. [The Washington Post]

8-0
Chaos at the Little League Softball World Series: A team from Washington was accused of throwing a game, which it lost 8-0, to prevent an Iowa team from advancing in the tournament. But officials stepped in and called for the two teams to meet in a special tiebreaker game, which the Iowa team won 3-2. The Iowans were later eliminated from the tournament by a team from Rhode Island. [WhoTV, Des Moines Register]



9.7 gigabytes




And the shoe has finally dropped: Hackers who stole data from AshleyMadison.com, a dating service for people looking to have an affair, have posted it on the Internet, all 9.7 gigs’ worth of email addresses, credit card data and personal information. Before you get giddy — yeah, it does have the makings of some sort of modern fable in which wannabe cheaters get their comeuppance — just a standard reminder that if you download it and look through it for people you might know, there’s no turning back from that. And somewhere out there, there’s a database of stuff you do that you would prefer not get out there. Mine was on Spotify, her name was Idina Menzel, and I already confronted that demon. Just advising — tread carefully here. [Wired]

56
The percentage of Americans who have not taken a vacation in the past 12 months, according to new research. That represents an increase of about 10 million people from the previous year. [Los Angeles Times]

64 retractions

Springer, an academic publisher, has issued retractions for 64 papers after the discovery that some peer reviews may have been faked. [The Washington Post]

95 percent
A report compiled for Public Health England found that electronic cigarettes — which release nicotine-infused vapor rather than combusted tobacco — are 95 percent less harmful than typical cigarettes. While that doesn’t mean they’re safe, the experts said they hoped that in the future, doctors would be able to prescribe electronic cigarettes to patients trying to stop smoking typical cigarettes. [BBC]

Mile 419.9 
The holy grail for a stoner apartment is a stolen mile marker 420, a number that has significance in cannabis culture. This means that these signs are stolen all the time. Idaho has now joined Colorado and Washington in removing mile marker 420 on highways and replacing it with mile marker 419.9. [Fox News]

1,200 bottles
Burglars opened 1,200 bottles of Koenig Pilsener beer in a store in Germany, apparently in an attempt to win a promotional prize involving bottle caps. You know, like in that episode of “Futurama” in which Fry goes to the Slurm factory, only real and in Germany and far dumber. [NBC News]

$1 billion
Valuation for the company behind messaging app Kik after a $50 million investment from Chinese tech powerhouse Tencent Holdings. Kik competes with larger rivals like Snapchat and Facebook’s WhatsApp, but for some reason, people like to talk to each other through the Internet, so the space appears promising. [Bloomberg]

$11.4 billion
The amount of money that a new report says will be spent on political ads during the 2016 election, roughly $1 billion of which will be digital advertisements. Iowans, now is a great time to download Adblock Pro — but be sure to disable it on FiveThirtyEight.com, your No. 1 source for news and analysis about the 2016 election. Please. I owe so much money to student loan lenders. [Wired]

2 women
The first women will graduate from the Army’s Ranger School this week. The Army opened up the prestigious and grueling school to women in January. [NPR]

20 to 50 percent
A Berklee College of Music report says that 20 percent to 50 percent of royalty payments aren’t getting to the correct musicians or rights-holders. That is partially because of the wildly changing economics of the music business: With streaming services calculating how much to pay, old databases and a byzantine royalty structure to be navigated, it’s not super surprising that some cash is flowing into cracks. [Fusion]

58
The percentage of Americans who have a favorable view of labor unions, according to a Gallup survey. That’s a 5 percentage point increase from last year. [Politico]

 61 percent

One way we can track America’s obesity problem is through the military, because the government is able to contractually weigh a whole bunch of people. Since 2002, there has been a 61 percent increase in obesity among active-duty forces, according to a new report. [Associated Press]

The oldest known American veteran has died at the age of 110. Emma Didlake joined the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps in 1943. [San Antonio Express-News] 


305 documents
Screeners poring over 30,000 messages from the private email account that Hillary Clinton used during her time as secretary of state have referred 305 of them for additional review before they can be released. [Bloomberg]

800 euros
A woman in Spain was fined 800 euros after posting a photograph of a police vehicle in a disabled parking spot to Facebook. She was punished under a new law that prohibits the use of images of officers that might jeopardize their safety. The law is called the Citizens Security Law — which is pretty rich, you know? [The Guardian]

$16,080

Derivative apps are nothing new: How often do you read the phrasing “Uber, but for ____” in articles about new apps? Apparently, the cost of cloning a popular app like Uber or Snapchat isn’t actually all that high. If you wanted to build a structural, technological clone of Tinder — just the core essential features of swiping left and right on people’s pictures — it would set you back about $10,800 on software development hiring site Gigster. So it turns out that my “Uber, but for geckos you can release in your apartment in lieu of calling an exterminator when you find bugs” business would cost me only $16,080 for a minimum viable product Uber clone! The science is behind me, and I am now pursuing funding. Hit me up VCs. [Priceonomics]

334,000
Remember back in May when the IRS said thieves had accessed the tax information of about 100,000 Americans on the agency’s website as part of a scheme to steal tax refunds? Yeah, the agency announced Monday that the number of potential victims was actually about 334,000. [Associated Press]

2 squirrels

Two squirrels in Yosemite National Park have died from the plague, leading officials to shut down a campsite. Did you know that 42 people have caught the plague in California since 1970? Did you know that apparently plague is still a thing? All of this is new and horrifying information to me. [Associated Press]

14 acres
Disney announced that it will build new “Star Wars” attractions at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland — 14 acres each. Full disclosure: I work for Disney (it owns ESPN, which owns FiveThirtyEight). Fuller disclosure: “Star Wars” plays an unsuitably large role in my life in general, so, yeah, I’m kind of a homer on thinking this is swell. [CNN Money]

20 years
The sperm of a ferret named Scarface who has been dead for about 20 years was successfully used for breeding. The black-footed ferret is critically endangered, which I suppose kind of — but not entirely — explains why someone has been holding on to ferret semen since the Clinton administration. [ScienceDaily]

70 times
The investigation into the explosions in Tianjin harbor continues, with reports emerging that a warehouse near the blasts may have held 70 times the allowed amount of sodium cyanide, a toxic chemical that is not supposed to be next to apartment buildings. [The Guardian]

95 percent

A yearlong investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that the Pinellas County School Board had transformed five schools in the county’s black neighborhoods into “failure factories” by abandoning integration and breaking promises of new resources. About 95 percent of black students tested at the schools are failing reading or math. [Tampa Bay Times]

250 babies
Nine months ago, Buffalo was hit with a freak storm that dropped 7 feet of snow on the city. That means that this month, Mercy Hospital is delivering a slightly higher-than-normal number of babies. Ask your parents to explain that. In a typical August, Mercy welcomes about 200 new Buffalonians, but this month, the hospital is expecting about 250. [NBC New York]

 1,000 scholarships
LeBron James’s foundation will pay the tuition to the University of Akron for more than 1,000 kids participating in the “I Promise” program. [SB Nation]

Donald Trump has released a set of immigration policy proposals. He wants to triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who detain and deport undocumented immigrants to 15,000, end the citizenship granted to anyone born in the U.S. regardless of their parentage, and increase just about any fee involved in getting from Mexico to the U.S. [ABC News]

70.1 percent
The latest data on commuting in America is out from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, and it shows that Americans still really love driving. In 2013, 70.1 percent of Americans 16 to 24 drove alone on their commute. And while that’s lower than the rest of the age groups — 76.4 percent of Americans overall drive alone on their commute — it’s still pretty high. The New York City metropolitan area — where I live — has only 56.9 percent of workers commuting by private automobile, the lowest rate in the country. [Census.gov]

When it comes to foolproof ways to win in a casino, “fake chips” are a pretty good option. But best not to flush them down a toilet. A man recently admitted to using millions in fake Borgata chips in Atlantic City, but only after being discovered because he tried to flush $5,000 worth of them. In fairness, this is likely the least illegal thing surreptitiously flushed down an Atlantic City casino toilet in years. [Yahoo News]

That’s how much Michael Jordan has made from sponsorships from 2000 to 2012. According to Jordan, the vast majority of it came from shoe retailer Nike. This kind of data very rarely hits the public eye: Jordan is suing a defunct grocery story for trading upon his name, and the data came out through financial disclosures released as part of the lawsuit. [Bloomberg]

£1.85 billion
Estimated cost of building a life-size replica of Minas Tirith, a Lord of the Rings locale, in the U.K., according to a group of architects trying to raise the ludicrous amount of money through a crowdfunding campaign.

The last recorded case of polio in sub-Saharan Africa occurred a little more than a year ago, on July 24, 2014. Barring any new cases, it’s only about three years until sub-Saharan Africa can be declared polio-free. There have been 34 cases of polio around the world in 2015 thus far, down from a half million in 1980. Nice work. [AllAfrica]

21 tons of TNT
A huge explosion rocked the harbor of Tianjin in northern China on Wednesday. At least 44 people are dead from the fires and blasts, which originated in a warehouse holding volatile chemicals.

I guess we ran out of mythological figures, because the International Astronomical Union is allowing people to vote on the names of exoplanets in other solar systems. Obviously a bunch of nerds showed up, so we’re probably going to have planets named after hobbits. Speaking of, vote for my “Bilbo” entry! [Popular Science]

Kraft Heinz Co. — the Frankenfood empire that resulted from a Warren Buffett-orchestrated merger in March — is looking to cut 2,500 of its roughly 46,000 employees to reduce costs. [Reuters]

20,000 Sun King Beer Cans
An Indianapolis brewery printed “TOM BRADY SUX” in the expiration date on its cans thanks to the initiative taken by an employee only known as Biscuit. This raises more questions than it answers, namely which of you FiveThirtyEight Deflategate commenters owns a brewery and why haven’t you said this before? [ESPN]

$5,818,808
According to documents obtained by Gawker, that’s how much money Buzzfeed spent in “cost of revenue” in the first six months of 2014, which includes money paid to places like Facebook for advertising campaigns the site was running. Buying traffic has become a big part of how sites drive traffic to advertiser posts — you need to get a certain number of eyeballs on sponsored content and the advertising copy might not cut it. [Gawker]


96 million
Someone dumped 96 million black floating “shade balls” into Los Angeles’s water supply! But it’s cool, because that someone is the city of Los Angeles and they are trying to protect the water they do have from evaporation. It’s the latest in a series of schemes, the main one being “just use less water.” [The Huffington Post]

Pork belly prices are up to $1.70 per pound wholesale, up 174 percent from the recent five-year low this past April. The pork market can be pretty volatile — demand is high now, but changes based on how much bacon the market wants to throw on everything, and supply can take a hit from disease in pig populations — but overall this is good news for farmers, who are otherwise seeing a 29 percent drop in pork prices overall. [Bloomberg]

$883,913
That’s how much money Rick Perry’s campaign for the presidency had on hand just a month ago on July 15. It apparently hasn’t been enough to keep the lights on for portions of his campaign — the staff in South Carolina is not being paid anymore, according to CBS reports. [The Washington Post]

Alphabet Inc. will be the general conglomerate, under which Google will comprise many of the ways the company makes money (YouTube, Android, etc.).

That’s how much money “Fantastic Four” made in its first weekend at the box office, coming in second to the grammatically abhorrent “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation.” [Associated Press]

2.7 million
Number of honeybee colonies in 2012, an increase from the levels in 2006. Bee populations are still suffering from colony collapse disorder, but beekeepers have managed to keep the apian populations rising. [The Washington Post]

34.5 million
Unique visitors to Vine in June, which is also roughly the number of visitors to Snapchat. Vine says it serves 100 million people every month, which at six seconds per Vine means that humanity spends 19 years of its time watching looping videos — every month. [Quartz]

3 arrests
Three people were arrested this week after allegedly planning to kill soldiers involved in the Jade Helm military exercises, the FBI said. Authorities said the three had stockpiled weapons and the components of an explosive, with a plan to booby trap some land in South Carolina. [MySanAntonio]


$9.99
Hoping to copy Netflix’s success with subscription streaming, prurient empire Pornhub announced plans for a premium streaming pornography service. Convincing people to pay for pornography on the Internet? I’ve heard a lot of crazy business models in this bold new age of startups, but color me skeptical here. [Venturebeat]

10 percent

Early reviews are not looking great for “Fantastic Four,” which opens this weekend and has a 10 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The director, Josh Trank, sent out a since-deleted tweet acknowledging the disappointing reviews and hinting that somewhere a cut of the movie exists that is indeed fantastic but that we will probably never see. Perhaps there was too much meddling from the Interdimensional Council of Reeds. Maybe this movie actually stars a bunch of Skrull impersonators of the Four. Or maybe we have somehow made Franklin Richards angry. Who can say? Here’s a little nugget from the room of 100 ideas: Stop making movies where Dr. Doom sucks — seriously, how do you screw up a character that rad? All hope lies in Doom. [The Daily Beast]

10 questions

Last night the top 10 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination met on a stage in Cleveland to debate. It was awesome. Surprisingly, the debate focused a lot more on foreign policy than economics, with 10 questions in total asked about foreign policy compared to six on the economy. In fairness, four questions were asked about God — regrettably nobody took a particularly bold stance there. [FiveThirtyEight]

30 minutes
North Korea is creating its own timezone by dropping clocks back 30 minutes in what will be called “Pyongyang time,” effective Aug. 15. So if you do a lot of business in North Korea, be sure to make a note. [The New York Times]

35 years
A Stradivarius violin stolen 35 years ago from Roman Totenberg, the father of NPR reporter Nina Totenberg, has been recovered. It’s worth millions. [Paste Magazine]

58 percent
At last night’s Republican debate, Chris Christie pushed to raise the retirement age for Social Security. This proposal is kind of a non-starter among the party’s base, though, as 58 percent of Republicans older than 50 oppose raising the retirement age. [FiveThirtyEight]

84 percent

SeaWorld is still reeling from “Blackfish,” the documentary that raised questions about its treatment of animals, with an 84 percent drop in profits in the second quarter compared to the year before. Attendance dropped by 100,000 people, about 1.5 percent. [The Guardian]

1 million gallons
A million gallons of mine waste contaminated a river in Colorado. At this point the universe is just trying to spite California. [Time]

$181 million
The Coast Guard captured a Sheen’s-worth of cocaine — roughly 12,000 pounds — in the Pacific Ocean that was being transported in a homemade submarine. The cocaine is worth about $181 million. [CNN]

3 percent 

Public Policy Polling ran a poll in Minnesota and we learned a bunch of stuff about an election that is months away. Whatever. Most importantly, they got favorability ratings for “Deez Nuts,” which is the best use of polling technology that I can think of. About 89 percent of respondents had no opinion about Deez Nuts (who filed as an independent candidate for president), while 3 percent had a favorable opinion and 8 percent had an unfavorable opinion. [Public Policy Polling]



22 percent
People are not vaccinating their kids against HPV, despite a safe and available shot that will keep them from getting some cancers later in life. Feels like a no-brainer, people. Only 22 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls 13 to 17 have been fully vaccinated against HPV. [FiveThirtyEight]

24 states
Since Aug. 9 of last year, when a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, there have been at least 984 protests in America over police treatment of black Americans, with 24 states passing police department reforms. [Samuel Sinyangwe]

29 percent
The Treasury is planning to add a new face to the $10 bill, and a McClatchy-Marist poll found that Eleanor Roosevelt is the preferred candidate of 29 percent of Americans. [McClatchyDC]

30.2 percent
The Media Diversity and Social Change Initiative’s new report has found that from 2007 to 2014 only 30.2 percent of speaking characters in the top 700 grossing films were female. Needless to say, this is a rather poor reflection of the gender breakdown of reality. I wrote about these folks last year, if you want more detail about their research. [USC Annenberg]

56 percent
Percentage of Americans who think the use of atomic bombs in Japan in 1945 was justified, down from 63 percent in 1991. [Pew Research Center]

69 percent

According to a new study of women, birth control pills were found to have a significant effect on mitigating the risk of endometrial cancer. The cancer risk for women who had used the pill was 69 percent of that of women who had not. [Forbes]

$1,300
A human monster stole about $1,300 worth of ice cream from a parked ice cream truck in Brooklyn in New York City. The gutless thief focused his cowardly raid on the Good Humor treats, which everyone knows are the good ones. Also, he got about $2,200 in cash, but it’s the ice cream that’s infuriating: How could you possibly eat that much? It’s like greed and gluttony all tied up in one crime. [GrubStreet]

$24 million
That’s the cost to TLC of canceling “19 Kids and Counting,” the reality show profiling the Duggar family. The show was canceled earlier this year after it was revealed that son Josh Duggar had molested several young girls. [The Hollywood Reporter]

1.2 billion
Britons took an estimated 1.2 billion selfies in 2014. I have nothing to add here. [The Guardian]

The Mississippi state primaries were Tuesday. Incumbent Gov. Phil Bryant won the Republican field handily, but the state Democratic Party did not exactly recruit a competitive slate: They’re going to get shellacked in the general no matter what. But! The victor in the Mississippi Democratic gubernatorial primary was trucker Robert Gray — who has never held elected office, was too busy to vote, and also reported raising zero dollars for his campaign. [The Clarion-Ledger, The Associated Press]

7 percent
Pennsylvania spends more than 7 percent of its annual state budget on its corrections system, about $2 billion. The state is considering basing punishments on the likelihood that an individual will commit more crimes in the future. Raises a lot of questions, right? [FiveThirtyEight]

8 percent

It’s been a year since CVS announced that it would stop selling cigarettes — a move that would involve short-term business lost with the hope of longer-term business gained — but details on those losses have finally appeared, and they’re not pretty. General merchandise sales — where cigarettes used to be — were down 8 percent at the drug store last quarter, and the company claimed that sales would have been flat if not for the change. [KMBC]

$3,800
The Australian speaker of the lower house resigned amid what’s being described as “Choppergate,” an incident where Bronwyn Bishop used government funds to pay for helicopter trips despite a fiscally conservative policy portfolio. As an American, I find this surprising for two reasons, the first being that a helicopter trip for a few grand could never tank a member of Congress, and the second being since when did other countries start adding “gate” to the end of their scandals? That’s our thing! [The Economist]

25,000
That’s the number of lampposts in San Francisco. The city’s issue is that the lampposts are decaying: On Monday, a urine-degraded lamppost fell on a car, according to city officials. Lot to digest in that sentence, I know, but apparently urine degrades lampposts (but not fire hydrants, oddly enough, according to the city) and also this is such a problem in San Francisco that the sheer volume of urine is enough to topple a metal light pole. The budget for replacing light poles increased from $500,000 to $5 million last year alone, I presume because of an ocean of pee coursing through city streets. [SFGate]

$1 million
Gaming companies are looking at the growing e-sports phenomenon and seeing a way to extend the playable life of multiplayer games. Microsoft announced that for the forthcoming “Halo 5: Guardians,” it will launch the Halo World Championship with prizes worth $1 million. The gamble is that the interest built up by watching competitive Halo will drive players to the fifth game. [CNET]

$27.4 million
A Picasso that was considered a national treasure in Spain, “Head of a Young Woman,” was intercepted by French customs while being smuggled out of the country. Hey, what’s Nic Cage been up to lately? [The Associated Press]

$3 billion or more

Major League Baseball is actually an integral part of streaming video online — MLB Advanced Media streams video for, in addition to baseball, the WWE, HBO and ESPN* — and the company indicated that after a board vote it would spin off the tech operations of Advanced Media into its own company. BAM Tech would be worth upwards of $3 billion. The company also announced that it inked a deal with the NHL to stream hockey games, too. [Recode]
*Standard disclosure, ESPN owns FiveThirtyEight, which is where I work.



9 billion gallons
That’s how much water lawns consume every day nationwide. About 1.9 percent of the lower 48’s land area is consumed by lawns. Seems pointless. [The Washington Post]

$1.3 trillion
The S&P 500 may be up since June of last year, but oil has taken a substantial hit in that time. Energy companies saw $1.3 trillion of their value wiped out in the crash of crude oil’s price to below $50 a barrel. [Bloomberg]

12 percent
“California is on fire” is kind of “dog bites man” this time of year, but one fire that covers about 94 square miles is currently only 12 percent contained. The Rocky fire has forced the evacuation of more than 13,000 people. [The Guardian]

27.24 percent interest rate
National Journal reports that GOP presidential candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has two credit-card debts of more than $10,000 each. On one account, Walker owes between $10,000 and $15,000 at a 27.24 percent interest rate, which seems like the rate you’d get from Frank out back the racetrack rather than Barclays. Also, fair warning that if you ever run for president people will be able to learn way too much about your financial life. [National Journal]

40-foot-tall minion
As if “Minions” weren’t already ruining your Facebook news feed, a 40-foot-tall balloon of one of the creatures got loose and flew into traffic in north Dublin on Monday, causing congestion. [The Independent]

720 years
The last time that the Welsh town of Conwy had an official jester appointed was in about 1295, 720 years ago, when King Edward I assigned Tom le Fol to the post. Now, a resident named Russel Erwood has claimed the esteemed position to reignite the tradition. The story makes no mention of the queen showing up, but the guy did complete a few feats, so based on everything I know about the laws of Wales (zilch), I guess that’s legitimate. [Raw Story]

1,041 percent

That’s the price increase on textbooks between January 1977 and June 2015. While this is obviously terrible for students and is yet another sign that the commodification and commercialization of learning is pretty screwed up, it’s catnip for people like me who took flak for skipping grad school to work in the lucrative and sexy field of writing crap on the Internet. [NBC News]

 5,357 bottles

Law enforcement in China has confiscated 5,357 bottles of baijiu (expensive grain liquor) products from two distillers in Guangxi as part of an investigation into whether the company added Sildenafil, which is the generic name for Viagra, into their alcoholic beverages. I knew something would fill the vacuum left after they nixed full-strength Four Loko, but I worry this may be a viral marketing campaign for The League. [Reuters]



$8,500
A journalist who was arrested during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in November settled a lawsuit against St. Louis County for $8,500 and the dropping of three charges. [The Huffington Post]

36,000 cases
Kraft has issued a recall for 36,000 cases of individually wrapped American cheese because part of the packaging might stick to the cheese and create a choking hazard. It’s worth noting that this is a problem because either (a) Americans are eating the singles with such voracity that they fail to notice that the packaging has not been fully removed from the processed cheese product, or (b) the flavor of plastic is not entirely distinguishable from the aforementioned processed cheese product. As an American who has thrown back his share of stacks of American cheese singles, I can say with authority that it’s probably a little bit of both. [CNN]

17 billion views
Facebook defines a video view as someone watching at least three seconds of a native video. This has made some content creators unhappy, as some unscrupulous news sites rip content from YouTube or other services to repost on Facebook. Of the top 1,000 most-popular vids from the first quarter of the year, 725 were re-uploads. These videos — which were not created by the entity that reposted and thus profits from them — accumulated some 17 billion views. Think of it this way: If each of those views was only three seconds, that still means humanity spent a cumulative 1,616 years and change watching reposts. [Business Insider]

Ronda Rousey KO’d Bethe Correia in 34 seconds in a UFC match Saturday. I think my colleague Andrew Flowers had the right of it when he said she fights like an outlier. [Deadspin]

35 percent

A new study out of the London School of Economics found that kids in the U.K. with low cognitive ability from high-income households were 35 percent more likely to grow up to be high-income earners than high-ability kids from poor families. [Gov.uk]

36 original shows

Netflix has made a massive investment in developing original content, and it appears to finally be paying off. It’s got a roster of 36 original shows in 2015 and beyond, more than perennial juggernaut HBO with 23. [Vulture]

49.7 percent
Spam accounted for 49.7 percent of email in June, which is actually the lowest it’s been since before 2003. Hear that, Gmail? Chill out. Stop putting our awesome Significant Digits newsletter in readers’ spam folder; we’re already winning this war. [Quartz]

100 percent
The trial of a Merck and NewLink Genetics vaccine for Ebola saw a 100 percent protection rate after 10 days for more than 4,000 people immunized. That’s awesome, for one, but also a handy little stat to keep in your pocket for when your anti-vaxxer friend gets into it on Facebook somewhere down the line. [CNBC]

5,700 stores
Rite Aid, which has about 4,600 drug stores, and Food Lion, which has about 1,100 locations, are each going to begin putting Cosmopolitan magazine behind blinders to reduce children’s exposure to sexuality. Now we may never truly know the exact nature of the “Sex So Hot You’ll Need to Crank the A.C.,” but I’ve narrowed it down to some combination involving a Williams-Sonoma Kitchen Torch, Everclear, welding gloves and Icy Hot. Get at it, people. [The New York Times]

$500,000
One day after it formed, MMWP12 LLC gave half a million dollars to the New Day Independent Media Committee, a group backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president. Business must really be booming! Or maybe someone is trying to squirrel some pseudo-anonymous cash through an intermediary to a campaign. Or MMWP12 LLC’s business could be booming too! [The Center for Public Integrity]

$2 million
Tiger Beat, the timeless magazine that distributes photographic hagiographies of pop stars, is headed for a revamp after 17 investors dumped $2 million into rebooting the magazine. [The New York Times]

$56 million
Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” may have a grammatically incoherent title, but it also made a boatload of money in its first weekend at the box office, with $56 million at a little less than 4,000 theaters. Classic Tom. [Variety]

$51 billion
After a funding round led by Microsoft and Bennett Coleman & Co., Uber’s valuation is now nearly $51 billion. That seems like a big, random-ish number that means nothing to the average person — welcome to tech valuations! — but here’s the big thing: for perspective on this, Uber hit a $51 billion valuation about two years faster than Facebook did.

2nd birthday
Right down to the wire, the Best Story Of July finally dropped: A toddler in Louisiana was so obsessed with the commercials for a local personal injury lawyer named Morris Bart that “Morris” and “Bart” were his second and third words. This kid is into Morris Bart. So when he turned 2, rather than a “Spider-Man” theme or whatever, his parents threw him a party with the theme of local personal injury lawyer Morris Bart. The kid loved it. The party made it into the The Wall Street Journal. This story is amazing. [The Acadiana Advocate]

30 percent

That’s the percentage of Republican voters who said they definitely did not support Donald Trump in his bid for the party’s presidential nomination, according to a Quinnipiac poll. [WHOtv]

95 percent
Percentage of New York residents surveyed who said they had never taken some action to prevent a car theft after hearing a car alarm go off. Spurring people to action is ostensibly the point of car alarms. But the alarms have somewhere between a 95 percent and 99 percent false-positive rate, so they’re pretty much pointless. [Priceonomics]

$240 per day
Big government is trying to bring down a hardworking business yet again: Two children (ages 8 and 10) from Cornwall, in England, were threatened with a $240 daily fine after selling worms on their front porch. (I am totally going to assume selling worms is some longstanding entrepreneurial endeavor for children in the United Kingdom.) [CFRA]

1,000 petaflops
While the Flop Race doesn’t have quite the same ring as the Space Race, an executive order from President Obama has begun an initiative to develop the first exaflop computer. “Flops” are a way to measure computing speed using the number of floating point operations — a type of arithmetic problem — a computer can perform per second. Right now, the best supercomputer on the planet is the 33.86 petaflop Tianhe-2 in China. An exaflop is about 1,000 petaflops, so it’s a lofty goal. [Wired]

16,000 graduates
Coding academies unaffiliated with traditional higher-ed computer science departments will see an estimated 16,000 programmers graduate this year. That’s about a third of the number of U.S comp sci grads from universities and may help fuel sky-high demand for software engineers. [The New York Times]

5,066 people

The number of people — about half of them bystanders, half passengers — who have been killed in the course of U.S. police car chases since 1979. [USA Today]

James Woods is suing an anonymous Twitter user for $10 million in a defamation suit over a tweet saying the actor was a cocaine addict. Woods disputes this. First rule of Twitter, everyone: Don’t argue with an egg. Nobody looks good after that. [The Hollywood Reporter]

The U.S. unemployment rate is projected to drop to 4.5 percent by December assuming current trends hold. Then again, “assuming current trends hold” is a dangerous sentence for forecasters. [Brookings]

America, your cars are old: The average vehicle age in this country is 11.5 years. So suck on that, planned obsolescence! [Associated Press]

19 years
Back in 1992, researchers in China saw a weird bird. It took 19 years, but scientists finally found the bird again and confirmed it was a new species, Locustella chengi (common name: Sichuan bush warbler). I’m simplifying the process a bit there, but all you need to know is that the Sichuan bush warbler makes sounds like an insect, a party trick I’m sure will never get old. [The Guardian]

3,447 one-star reviews

As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, the dental practice of Walter Palmer had racked up 3,447 one-star reviews on Yelp. The negative ratings may have less to do with the dentist’s drill skill and more to do with the fact that the guy paid a bunch of money to shoot a beloved lion for sport. [Motherboard]

3,800 miles
A chunk of airplane wreckage washed up on the island of Réunion, east of Madagascar, and it may have come from MH370, the plane that disappeared last year. If it is, it has travelled at least 3,800 miles from the last known location of the plane. (I’d make a joke about CNN, but I just got back from vacation.) [Wired]

$75,000
Three University of Virginia graduates are suing Rolling Stone magazine and reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely for defamation over the retracted article “A Rape on Campus.” The plaintiffs belonged to the fraternity whose members were accused in the story of raping another student. While an exact number has not been set, the plaintiffs are suing for upwards of $75,000. [The Washington Post]

A Turkish CEO who sold his food-delivery startup for $589 million paid the company’s 114 employees a combined $27 million, breaking down to about $237,000 each in bonuses. [CNN Money]

968 million daily active users
Facebook earnings dropped yesterday as the company reported it had 968 million daily active users, below expectations. People spend on average 46 minutes per day on the company’s suite of products, which includes Instagram. [Business Insider]

$2.9 billion
Donald Trump says his net worth exceeds $10 billion, and his recent financial disclosure filing with the Federal Election Commission puts the figure at $8.7 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which has some experience in this kind of thing, puts it closer to $2.9 billion. I’m sure this disagreement will elicit a reasoned, rational response from Camp Trump. [Bloomberg]

7,845,460,401 uniques

Washington’s football team reported that it got 7,845,460,401 unique visitors for its print and online coverage of its 2014 training camp. Quick check: There are slightly fewer people on Earth. Washington is either working from a particularly innovative perspective on the meaning of “unique visitor” or — and this is just a working theory — a professional sports team might be overstating figures in order to extract concessions from a host city.

1 coach
That’s the number of female coaches in the NFL after Jen Welter was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as an assistant coaching intern. The NBA also has one female assistant coach, while MLB and MLS have no female coaches. As my colleague Leah Libresco tweeted: “We were going to graph the share of female coaches in men’s sports, but the bars were too small to see.” [FiveThirtyEight]

4 jokes

Conan O’Brien is being sued for stealing jokes from Twitter. A man who says he was a longtime writer for Jay Leno claims an airline joke (wow, I’m laughing already) as well as jokes about Tom Brady, Caitlyn Jenner and the Washington Monument were pilfered from his feed and used on O’Brien’s show. Conan’s production company believes the suit is without merit. Coco, I’m gonna do you a solid: I’m tweeting a joke right now, just for you. I waive all rights, please feel free to use it in tonight’s monologue. [The Hollywood Reporter]

8 farms
I’ve got my tent firmly pitched in the pro-cilantro camp, but my allegiance is being tested. The FDA has banned some cilantro imported from Mexico after investigators discovered “human feces and toilet paper in and around growing fields.” Eight of the 11 farms and packing houses investigated in the Mexican state of Puebla had “objectionable conditions” and five were linked to hundreds of outbreaks in the U.S. of cyclosporiasis. [CNN]

15 percent
Share of Americans who do not use the Internet. They must be so happy. [Pew Research Center]

63.5 percent
Homeownership in the U.S. is at a 48-year low. The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate is now 63.5 percent, down from pre-recession highs of above 69 percent. Both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates, however, have also fallen. This means a tight housing market — to which I can anecdotally attest, having recently hunted for an apartment — and a possible boon to the economy in ensuing construction. [The Wall Street Journal]

200 to 400 feet
Amazon has proposed that some prime (get it?) airspace, from 200 to 400 feet off the ground, be reserved for high-speed drones. The company has visions of one day delivering its packages by drone. [The Guardian]

10,000 texts

Tom Brady’s four-game “Deflate-gate” suspension has been upheld by the NFL. In a statement on the decision, the league said Brady had destroyed his cellphone, despite investigators’ requests to access it. The phone had been used to exchange 10,000 text messages over four months — or just more than 80 texts a day. Even still, Brady’s got nothing on the 18 to 24 set — those kids send and receive more than 125 texts a day! [The Washington Post]

$50,000 in bunny care
After 103 rabbits were seized from her home, a Brooklyn woman has been ordered to pay $50,000 for their care. The bunnies had become celebrities in their neighborhood. [New York Post]

$2 million a year
You have to pay about $1,500 to license the song “Happy Birthday.” Yeah, that “Happy Birthday.” Two filmmakers upset by that fact have uncovered evidence that they say negates Warner/Chappell Music’s 1935 copyright and puts the song in the public domain. The copyright has at some points netted its owners about $2 million a year. [Ars Technica]

304 million core users

Twitter’s stock price slumped more than 11 percent Tuesday, after slower than expected growth in its average monthly users. The company said it now has 304 million “core users.” That’s up from 302 million last quarter, but the growth was the slowest since the company went public. [Reuters]

Chinese stocks took a big hit Monday as two major indices fell more than 8 percent. Some blame the drop on “malicious” short selling. Regulators vowed to deal sternly with anyone engaging in such trading behavior, “in Beijing’s latest attempt to stave off a full-blown market crash.” [Reuters]

35 women
New York magazine published the stories of 35 women who have come forward publicly to accuse Bill Cosby of rape or sexual assault, and agreed to be interviewed and photographed. In total, 46 women have now accused Cosby publicly. “The group, at present, ranges in age from early 20s to 80 and includes supermodels … alongside waitresses and Playboy bunnies and journalists and a host of women who formerly worked in show business,” wrote Noreen Malone and Amanda Demme. [New York]

40 percent
The share of adults on the face of the Earth who have never heard of climate change. Most of them serve in Congress. But seriously, folks, this suggests to researchers the importance of education, and understanding the country- and culture-specific nature of how climate change is perceived. [The Washington Post]

300 trucks
French farmers turned away 300 trucks containing meat and dairy products at the border with Germany. The farmers are angry about the low prices for their own produce, and sought to scuttle the would-be imports. Farmers also blocked food trucks on the Spanish border the day before. [AP]

True fact: Visionary humans Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have taken action to save the world from killer robots. I didn’t really know killer robots were an actual thing until just this moment, but OK, I feel safe-ish knowing they’re on it. So what action did Musk and Hawking take to protect us from a hellish revolution of autonomous weapons? They, along with 1,000 others, signed an open letter that will be presented at a conference. Hmm. Well, on behalf of humankind, uh, thanks? [ABC News]

2,000 bags
New York City authorities seized 2,000 bags of synthetic marijuana from delis in East Harlem last week, after seizing 8,000 bags of the substance in a raid early this month. Synthetic marijuana — also called spice — sells for as little as $2 a packet, and is apparently difficult to ban because of always-shifting chemical formulae used in its manufacture. Drugs of this type, however, have been linked to spikes in overdoses and emergency room visits in New York City and elsewhere. [Gothamist]

50,000 mariners
The Thai fishing fleet, which fills much of the American demand for cheap fish, has an annual labor shortage of around 50,000 mariners. Much of that shortage is filled by migrants from Cambodia and Myanmar, who “become so-called sea slaves in floating labor camps.” [The New York Times]

$55,000

A hunter bribed guides $55,000 so he could kill a lion in Zimbabwe. The lion, named Cecil, was a major attraction at Hwange National Park. It was shot with a crossbow and survived, but was later shot with a rifle, beheaded and skinned. And as if this story wasn’t too goddamn sad already, Cecil’s six cubs will now be killed, since another male lion won’t abide them in the pride. [BBC]

$100 million a day

The Northeast Corridor, the rail sector reaching from Boston to Washington, D.C., and carrying 750,000 passengers a day, is crumbling. Amtrak owns a majority of the rail infrastructure along the corridor, and President Obama has called for a $1 billion increase in the rail service’s subsidy next year, while House Republicans passed a bill last month to trim it by $250 million. If the Northeast Corridor were shut down for just one day, according to one report, it would cost the country $100 million. [The New York Times]

$4 billion

LaGuardia Airport, a well-known dumpster fire in Queens, is getting a facelift. Well, more like a face transplant. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Vice President Joe Biden — who once compared the airport to “some Third World Country” — unveiled the plan to demolish LaGuardia’s existing buildings and replace them with a big, new terminal. The plan’s first phase is slated to cost $4 billion. The new parts will open to passengers in 2019, and hey, I bet it’ll be really fun when it’s under construction! [AP]

2 titles
Chris Froome has joined the Tour de France elite, clinching his second victory on Sunday in Paris. Now only 20 men — excluding Lance Armstrong, whose seven titles have been officially stripped — have won the general classification on multiple Tours. Froome, a Kenya-born Brit, also took the much-cooler-sounding King of the Mountains honor as the event’s best climber. He was only the sixth rider to take both crowns in one year. [The Guardian]

15 years
Chinese gamers, lament: I’m about to destroy you in “Halo.” China just lifted its 15-year ban on video game consoles, allowing companies like Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony to hawk their wares across the country — one of “the world’s largest videogame markets.” [The Wall Street Journal]

15 percent
Tourism in Cuba has jumped, up 15 percent in the first five months of this year. After a normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, some worry that Cuba may eventually lose its “1950s nostalgia” and become just another tourist trap. As long as any radical transformation does not eliminate mojitos, I would still like to visit. [NPR]

18 percent
Donald Trump, The World’s Greatest Troll, is trolling right along. Trump is drawing 18 percent support among Republicans, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll. This puts him atop the expansive field of Republican presidential hopefuls nationally, besting Jeb Bush’s 15 percent. Trump also leads in New Hampshire — and is a close second to Scott Walker in Iowa — according to recent NBC News/Marist polling. Chicken Little could not be reached for comment. [CNN]

$25 gift card
Nike will pay up to $2.4 million per a settlement in a lawsuit related to its FuelBand. (Apple was also named as a defendant, but the company bears no liability.) Beneficiaries of the class action settlement can apply for $15 cold, hard cash, or a $25 Nike gift card. According to the plaintiffs, the product’s ability to accurately measure physical activity, like steps taken and calories burned, was overblown. [AppleInsider]

45 2/3 innings
On Sunday, a hapless Zack Greinke gave up a run to a pitcher (a pitcher!) on one of the worst offensive teams in the league to end his pathetic 45 2/3-inning scoreless streak. The Mets’ Jacob deGrom notched an RBI (just his second of the year) on a fielder’s choice in the bottom of the third against the Dodgers. Greinke’s was only the fourth-longest such streak in the expansion era. The Dodgers went on to lose in 10 innings. [USA Today]

51 million posts
Lost your phone? You’re not alone. In an average month, “more than 51 million posts, comments, likes and shares are related to users discussing lost phones,” according to Facebook. Amazingly, though, over 75 percent of posts about lost phones are made from other mobile devices. [Adweek]

$105 million

Fiat Chrysler has been fined a record $105 million, as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cracks down on safety violations. Chrysler reportedly mishandled nearly two dozen recalls of its automobiles. In one high-profile incident, Jeep Grand Cherokee models from 1993 to 2007 were shown to be “prone to deadly fires.” More than 50 deaths have been linked to that problem. [CNN Money]

$200 million
The Venezuelan brewing industry is $200 million in debt to suppliers, and the country could stop brewing beer by August. Strict currency controls have made crucial beer-related imports such as barley and malt scarce. Supplies of toilet paper and shampoo have reportedly also been scant. A shortage of beer, however, would clearly be much, much worse. [Fusion]

$49 billion
AT&T and DirecTV are merging. The deal — worth $49 billion — was approved by the FCC on Friday. If you’re having déjà vu, it may be because of Comcast’s $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable, which fell apart in April. I’d like to apologize in advance to all Significant Digits readers for their inevitable customer service-induced stress dreams. This column will return tomorrow, sometime between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. [Variety]

$4.50
A bill in the House of Representatives would, among other things, cap airline bag fees at $4.50. Will this actually happen? I’m dubious. Is it remarkable trolling of the airlines? Absolutely, and I want Congress to do stuff like this more often. Kudos Rep. John Mica. [MSN]

18-year-old drivers
Congress is also considering legislation, backed by the trucking industry, that would allow 18-year-olds to drive 18-wheelers. Forty-eight states already allow this, but only within state lines. I am weighing my worry about Snapchatting truckers against my desire to have an Amazon Prime package at my doorstep even faster, and I’m not going to lie: I think I’m OK with this. [Bloomberg Politics]

40 minutes

The average YouTube video watching session on mobile phones is up to 40 minutes — just one reason YouTube’s mobile revenue has doubled year-over-year. [Business Insider]

92 percent
In an international survey looking at economic optimism (and pessimism), Nigerians are the most optimistic about their nation’s financial situation, with 92 percent of those surveyed believing their economy will improve. [Bloomberg]

4,175 planets
NASA — basically the MVP of the U.S. government at this point — identified 500 new exoplanets, or planets around other stars. One is Earth-like, but nobody reading this will ever be alive to see it up close; it’s 1,400 light years away. The total number of planets identified by the Kepler telescope is now 4,175. [Wired]

$9 million
Putting butter in your coffee is really tasty, but not ideally a summer thing if you ask me. Still, the folks behind Bulletproof Coffee, a company that sells buttered coffee online, raised $9 million from VCs to start a brick-and-mortar operation. [Fortune]

5 million gamers
That’s the number of people registered in the Electronic Sports League (ESL), a governing body for e-sports that announced Thursday it will begin testing for performance enhancing drugs, specifically Mountain Dew Code Red. I’m joking; the ESL wants to find dopers who are on Adderall. I’m looking forward to pained, handwringing meditations from future moralizing e-sports columnists on the disastrous Adderall era of League of Legends, and how they’re withholding their Hall of Fame vote for that promising Mid-laner who was suspected of doping with his little brother’s Concerta. In the end, all sports — even non-sports — are the same. [Associated Press]

$1.31 billion
Nikkei will buy the Financial Times from Pearson for $1.31 billion. I assume the technology behind pink newspaper was a crucial element of the deal. [MarketWatch]

$4.8 billion
Levi’s revenues are down to about $4.8 billion from about $7 billion two decades ago. The culprit: yoga pants. [Bloomberg]

$30 billion
Amazon announced strong quarterly earning on Thursday, leading to a $30 billion rise in the company’s market value. That makes Amazon more valuable than Wal-Mart, at least for the moment. [Quartz]

I’m taking a few days off early next week, so once again the wonderful Oliver Roeder will be your guide through the significant digits of the world. If you see a digit in the wild, tweet it to him at @Ollie.

5 gorings
Please stop trying to take pictures next to bison, they are wild animals with very large, very point horns. Five people have been gored by bison at Yellowstone National Park this year. It is unclear how many “likes” their pictures got on Instagram, but I feel like no matter the answer, it probably wasn’t worth getting gored by an ungulate. [National Parks Traveler]

9 cases of leprosy
Florida remains the cradle of American innovation, at least when it comes to the resurgence of generally obsolete infections that can result in disfiguring skin conditions. Armadillos are considered responsible for nine cases of leprosy in the Sunshine State. [The Daily Beast]

10:30 a.m.
The day is currently divided into two halves: 10:30 or later, a grim time of misery and toil; and the time before 10:30 a.m., when you can get breakfast at McDonald’s. According to a memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal, though, the bleakness of post-10:30 a.m. life may soon end, as McDonald’s is considering making all-day breakfast available nationwide after trials in San Diego and Nashville. [The Wall Street Journal]

5 vacated convictions

Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence after trying to sell President Obama’s senate seat, saw five of his convictions vacated by federal judges and will get a retrial on those counts. [The Hill]

30 percent
That’s the percentage of surveyed Americans who think U.S. military action against the Islamic State group (also known as ISIS or ISIL) is going at all well. [Pew Research Center]

59 percent
That’s the current approval rating of Pope Francis in the U.S., down from 74 percent in February of last year. Among U.S. Catholics, the pontiff’s approval still stands at an all-things-considered-pretty-good 71 percent, though that is down from 89 percent in 2014. It’s unclear how this will affect the Pope in his crucial bid for reelectio- Oh, wait, public opinion literally matters nothing at all for the papacy, and I have no idea why we’re even bothering to ask this stuff. Carry on. [Gallup]

60 percent
At any given time, 60 percent of people in jails around the country are waiting on trials because they can’t afford or obtain bail. [The Takeaway via @TJRaphael]

62,000 Abercrombie & Fitch employees
There’s a class action lawsuit covering 62,000 Abercrombie & Fitch employees related to claims the company forced employees to buy its banal clothing to wear at work. [The Huffington Post]

550,000 video clips
The Associated Press is dropping 550,000 archival news video clips going back to 1895 on to YouTube. The listicle aggregation economy is going to have a field day. [Variety]

27 million dressers
Following the death of two children, IKEA announced a repair program for some 27 million chests of drawers and dressers that posed a tip-over hazard. [Consumer Product Safety Commission]

+1.58 degrees
This past June was the hottest on record, 1.58 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the 20th century average. And if the current trend holds for the rest of the year, 2015 will be one of the hottest years ever recorded. A strong El Niño in the Pacific Ocean is getting stronger, which isn’t going to help. [Bloomberg]

3 movie studios
Sony Pictures Animation and director Anthony Leondis signed a “near seven-figure deal” for an emoji-themed comedy. Let me say that more clearly: Sony Pictures Animation paid someone about a million dollars for a movie about emoji. If that wasn’t absurd enough, know that Sony beat out two other studios in the auction for the movie. It’s been real, Western Civilization. [Deadline]

$7.75
Price of a small beer at the stadiums of the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs, the most expensive of the ballparks surveyed. However, a small beer in Boston is smaller than a small beer in Philly. Breaking it down by ounce, Boston definitively takes the prize as the worst ballpark to drink at, with booze costing $0.65 per ounce. Yet another reason to never go to Boston. [VinePair]

33 percent
Apple revenues rose 33 percent in the third quarter. It would be wonderful to say how much of that bump was due to the release of the Apple Watch, but the company is mum on how many watches were actually moved. [Wall Street Journal]

2 moons
As part of its Pluto flyby, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft is also getting a closer look at some of the dwarf planet’s more offbeat moons, like the 26-mile-long, 22-mile-wide Nix and the 34-mile-long, 25-mile-wide Hydra. [The Verge]

600 visitors
Number of monthly visitors to Kisumu, Kenya, a city close to the ancestral village of U.S. President Barack Obama’s family. Obama is visiting Kenya this week, and he’s apparently considered a pretty big deal over there. [Wall Street Journal]

800 square miles

If you want to buy an 800 square mile Texas ranch that spans six counties and has upwards of 1,000 oil wells, the W.T. Waggoner Estate Ranch can be yours for the low, low price of $725 million. [Bloomberg]

1.1 million books
Sales of “Go Set a Watchman” passed 1.1 million, according to Harper Collins on Monday, making the conveniently found book the publisher’s hottest seller ever. I assume the publisher is sending a fleet of interns to Alabama to scour the property of the infirm Harper Lee, hoping to dredge up any other unpublished manuscripts squirreled away in the crawl space or backyard. [Associated Press]

65 million illegal streamers
Number of people who live outside of the United Kingdom who illicitly stream BBC shows through the network’s iPlayer, according to new research. Please don’t take my “Downton Abbey” from me, BBC, I need my stories. [The Guardian]

71.5 million square feet
There’s a Pentagon’s worth of vacant office space available in the Washington D.C. metro area. Preferences in working environments are moving away from office parks and to urban centers. If anyone has ideas on what to do with it, there’s 71.5 million square feet of space for you around Washington. [The Washington Post]

9.5 percent
Microsoft is giving Windows 10 away for free to current users of the operating system. Microsoft’s motivation: PC shipments were down 9.5 percent worldwide during the second quarter of this year, and only 3 percent of smartphones have a Windows operating system. [The New York Times]

56 percent
That’s the level of support for the Iran nuclear deal in the United States, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post survey. On the other hand, 64 percent of respondents in the same poll said they are “not so confident” or “not confident at all” the deal will work. [The Washington Post]

750,000 people
Need a reason to use Tinder at the airport? Current and former airline employees, and their families, get perks like being able to fly for free in empty seats! In the American Airlines program alone, there are 750,000 people who are eligible. [Bloomberg]

$10 million
Former FIFA Vice President Jeffrey Webb, after being extradited to the U.S. on corruption charges, posted a $10 million bond on Saturday. He put up the bond in the form of 10 homes, three cars, 11 luxury watches and a load of jewels. Something’s fishy with these FIFA people, I’m telling ya. [Deadspin]

37 million users
Are you on AshleyMadison.com, the online dating site designed to facilitate affairs? If so, I have some good news and some bad news. The good news: You may soon find closure in your troubled relationship. The bad news: That closure may come thanks to hackers, who stole the financial information and user database of the site’s 37 million members and are attempting to publish it. So now’s a great time to pitch a vacation to your significant other — really unplug from modern life. [Krebs on Security]

$100 million

Russian billionaire Yuri Milner kicked in $100 million to sweep space for evidence of alien life. [Wired]

$226.4 million
Since the Green Bay Packers are owned by shareholders and not a single private owner, the team’s reports are public and one of our only glimpses into how the actual business of the NFL gets done. Documents from the franchise show each team got $226.4 million from the league last year as part of revenue sharing from TV and other rights. [ESPN]

904 million
That’s the number of food delivery orders conducted online in the year ending May 2015, compared to 1.02 billion conducted over the phone. Online delivery orders will soon beat phone orders if the trends of the past five years hold. [Quartz]

$19.6 billion
The craft beer market is massive — $19.6 billion this year — and one beer, in particular, is making waves this summer. There are amazing conspiracy theories brewing around Small Town Brewery’s “Not Your Father’s Root Beer.” Namely, that Small Town Brewery is actually affiliated with the folks who bottle Smirnoff Ice and Mike’s Hard Lemonade and Four Loko. So, if true, it’s not quite a small town brewery (kind of like The Simpsons’ Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club). The fact that this is plausible proves to me that the beer market is absurd. [International Business Times]

$50 billion
Over the next 50 years, that’s the cost of a plan to make sure Louisiana’s wetlands don’t disappear into the Gulf of Mexico. The state is losing 16 square miles per year due to erosion, and a $50 billion plan from the government and industry is trying to stop that. [PRI]

2.7 percent
That’s the average level of support New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie earned in three Republican primary polls conducted during July. That’s low enough that Christie is in danger of missing the first GOP debate on Aug. 6. [FiveThirtyEight]

3rd place
NASA had a big week last week, mostly because they managed to take lots of pictures of dwarf planet Pluto, but also because they got a lot of people interested in seeing those images. NASA.gov was the third-highest trafficked government-run domain last week. Who could have ever guessed that people were still interested in space? [The Washington Post]

54 years

The U.S. embassy in Cuba reopened Monday after 54 years of being shuttered. [CNN]

71 percent
There’s an avian flu outbreak among U.S. chickens, and lots of birds are being killed to contain the virus. About 71 percent of the 48 million culled chickens were egg-laying or related to the egg-layers. This has driven prices of eggs up, to the point that eggs are “more expensive on a protein-per-dollar basis than chicken breasts for the first time on record.” [Quartz]

$93
Google stock exploded Friday for some reason, jumping $93 to close at $672.93. This means that, over the course of a single day, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin each added $4 billion to their net worths. [Bloomberg]

3,500 acres
A huge fire consuming 3,500 acres broke out around I-15 in California on Friday, destroying 20 vehicles and four homes. [Los Angeles Times]

278,000
“Joe Dirt 2” is not getting rave reviews, precisely, but the direct-to-streaming film starring David Spade reportedly garnered 278,000 viewers on Crackle in its first 24 hours. [AV Club]

$58 million
“Ant-Man” won the weekend at the box office with $58 million, edging out “Minions” and “Trainwreck.” [CNN]

$160 million
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into potential wrongdoing by FIFA sponsors. The SEC is investigating a $160 million deal involving “Sportswear Company A.” The description of the sportswear company suggests it’s Nike, Reuters reported, although Nike is not named in any investigation at the moment.

$13.36

SherpaShare, an app that helps drivers keep track of the money they make while ferrying people through ride-sharing apps, has a new report out about its users. Uber trips, according to SherpaShare, cost an average of $13.36 and Lyft trips cost $12.53. [Time]

20 percent
The San Francisco Bay area’s public transportation system, BART, has seen ridership jump 20 percent since 2012, and the system is under a heavy load without the money needed to maintain it. If only the Silicon Valley area was able to come up with some sort of way to pay for this. Maybe BART should pitch itself as a subscription-based, ride-sharing commuter distribution platform seeing huge growth numbers over the past several quarters with little runway but impressive growth potential. That’ll get some suckers to open their wallets. [San Francisco Business Times]

33 percent
That’s the percent of people 65 and older who think that Americans work too little, the highest percentage to hold that view among any age bracket. I’m sure all of us in the workforce appreciate retirees’ thoughts on the matter. [YouGov]

38 lawmakers
Greece has agreed to a bailout! Naturally, this means even more political chaos in Greece. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is the leader of the Syriza party, which has 149 seats in the nation’s parliament. But 38 Syriza members voted against the bailout Tsipras negotiated. Since that’s a quarter of his coalition, this could mean a leadership challenge, a coalition government, or even snap elections. The Greeks sure have to vote on lots of things — side effect of inventing this whole democracy thing, I suppose. [Bloomberg]

126 grams
The average American consumer buys 126 grams of sugars by way of packaged foods and soft drinks every day. [Fusion]

12,734 pounds
That’s how much caviar the U.S. imported in 2014. Because Iran produces lots of caviar, that could go up if the Iranian nuclear deal makes it through Congress. [Quartz]

$46,725,329.13
That’s how much money the Clinton campaign has brought in so far, according to its first FEC filing. The campaign has been seriously burning through money, though, spending $19 million already. [CNN]

$213,606,575
According to his financial disclosure forms, Donald Trump made $213,606,575 from doing 14 seasons of The Apprentice. But given that disclosure involves Donald Trump and money, and that the documents were written like a brochure at a marketing seminar, proceed with caution. [Business Insider]

2.53 billion gallons
That’s how much pig excrement is produced by the state of North Carolina annually. All of that needs to go somewhere, and often that somewhere is reservoirs of excrement pushing into poor communities. I’m saving this stat about pig shit for the next time I’m stuck at a bar in March and the Duke game is on. [Quartz]

0.5 percent
The President granted clemency to 46 people Monday who were in prison for drug offenses. This brings the percent of commutation requests granted over the course of his presidency to 0.5 percent, higher than both President Bushes but less than President Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan or Clinton. [FiveThirtyEight]

11 percent
According to a new poll, 11 percent of Americans feel the U.S. will never recover from the 2008 financial crisis. [YouGov]

13 runs
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is running for president, and the guy has experience: he’s run for office 13 times, winning 11 of those races. Donald Trump’s record…doesn’t quite compare. [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]

19 times

By one count, the number of times Walker has tweeted about his haircut. [Christopher Ingraham]

83 percent
“We should just give people with PTSD some MDMA” may seem like something a person who was on MDMA would say, but there’s legitimate evidence that it may aid some people recovering from a traumatic event. One study found 83 percent of patients on MDMA saw a reduction in symptoms. Now there’s going to be a clinical study in Canada looking into this further. [MacLean’s]

$5 million
50 Cent owes a woman $5 million after a judge found he violated her privacy when releasing a private sex tape. In plausibly related news: 50 Cent declared bankruptcy Monday. [The Wall Street Journal]

$5.9 million
The City of New York agreed to settle with the family of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by the NYPD, for $5.9 million. The city had until Friday to reach a settlement or else face a lawsuit. [The Guardian]

$10 million 

I am a long-time advocate for innovative biological solutions to difficult biological problems. So of course I’m thrilled to hear of a Texas plan to spend $10 million introducing an invasive European wasp to fight back against an invasive European weed that’s clogging up the Rio Grande. [Bloomberg]

65 million
Netflix is expected to announce it has 65 million worldwide subscribers Wednesday, which sent the price of its shares up 5 percent. [Quartz]

1.5 kilometers
The head of the Sinaloa Cartel escaped from a maximum security Mexican prison this weekend through a 1.5-kilometer tunnel the cartel had evidently constructed. This is the second time that Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman has escaped from prison, and something tells me incarceration has not helped him learn his lesson or made him change his ways. [ABC News]

3 titles
Novak Djokovic won his third Wimbledon title this past weekend. He then ate some grass, because the trophy wasn’t filling. [Digg]

20 colleges
Twenty schools are responsible for a fifth of all grad school college loan debt, a group that counts among its number several for-profit colleges, expensive private schools and off-shore medical schools. [The Washington Post]

$23 million
The Decision: LeBron James signed a one-year contract to stay in Cleveland next year, with an option for another year following it. [Cleveland.com]

25 percent
Advertisements take up more bandwidth than one might think. AdBlock Plus funded a study to see what would happen if an entire college network used its product, and Simon Fraser University saw overall data transfer on its network drop 25 percent. [Slashdot]

$65 million

That’s the tax haul for Washington state after its first year of legal marijuana. Pot sales brought in more than $260 million in their first year. [Reuters]

$115 million

“Minions” took the top spot at the box office this weekend, heralding a new benchmark in the gradual decline of western civilization. Domestically, the film made $115.2 million. [Los Angeles Times]

460 visits
That’s the estimate for the number of “Make-a-Wish” foundation visits that professional wrestler John Cena has made, a record for the organization that matches sick kids with people they want to meet. [New York Post]

$985 million
That’s how much the International Olympic Committee reported it took in from the 2004 Athens Games. The games were nowhere near as fruitful for the host nation, which is now trying to handle a series of crippling debts while still having the real estate detritus of a sports event from a decade ago. [Politico Europe]

$60.59 billion
Estimate for how much money Americans will spend on their pets in 2015, about 25 percent higher than how much they spent in 2010. Dogs are the most expensive to raise. [NBC News]

Number of ticker-tape parades in New York City that honored only women between 1961 and 2014. On Friday, the U.S. women’s national soccer team — winners of this year’s World Cup — breaks that spell. [FiveThirtyEight]

12
The number of U.S. presidents who did not have a college degree. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is expected to be the only major candidate in the 2016 contest without one. Among the 2016 candidates, the most common pre-politics occupation is lawyer. There are also a handful of businesspeople and doctors. [National Journal]

17 stars
A Confederate battle flag shown on the U.S. House floor in a debate over its removal from federal property had an incorrect number of stars, 17 rather than 13. What’s the worst that can happen, the South actually rising again? Right, yeah. [The Hill]

70 percent
Bloodstream infections that occur when bacteria get into central lines, the tubes that hospitals insert into patients’ chests to deliver medications, are a disconcerting cause of death in the U.S. health-care system. There’s a five-step procedure to reduce the risk — intensive care units in Michigan that implemented the checklist cut central line infections by 70 percent, according to one study. [Vox]

999 kilobytes

The largest ever bitcoin transaction — a 999 kilobyte file’s worth of the cryptocurrency — was completed Tuesday when a Chinese mining consortium sought to stymie an attack on the process that facilitates bitcoin transactions. [Motherboard]

$390,000
Tough luck for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker: A meeting with hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb reportedly went badly, and Loeb declined to support Walker’s nascent presidential campaign because of the governor’s opposition to same-sex marriage. In 2012, Loeb gave $390,000 to independent expenditure committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. [Business Insider and the Center for Responsive Politics]

4 million
That’s the number of Americans currently wearing braces, according to the American Association of Orthodontists. It sucks, kids, but it’s worth it. [The Atlantic]

22.1 million
Hacks of federal Office of Personnel Management databases keep looking worse and worse: The government said Thursday that 22.1 million people were affected. Seriously though, how on Earth do you find a guy who can fence 1.1 million fingerprint records you found when they fell off a truck? Who would possibly buy them? Batman? [The Washington Post]

$114 million
Jeb Bush and his super PAC allies hauled in more than $114 million from donors in the first six months of the year. [Associated Press]

2 shots

Norwegian police officers fired their guns a mere two times in the line of duty in 2014; no one was killed or injured. In the past 12 years, only two people have been killed by police in shootouts. [The Local]

3.5 hours
A technical problem halted trading on the New York Stock Exchange from about 11:30 a.m. to just after 3 p.m. Eastern time. The market was not able to provide accurate data, and the exchange’s president suspended trading. [Bloomberg]

12 times
In what is by far the weirdest story I have heard all week, mustachioed actor Tom Selleck has been accused by a Southern California municipal water district of using a commercial truck to pull water from a hydrant and bring it back to his home — on 12 different occasions. The district has filed suit against the actor. [The Hollywood Reporter]

10 days
It looks like Maine Gov. Paul LePage may have messed up. He had 10 days to veto a bill he opposes that gives aid to immigrant asylum-seekers but did not. His office says that by not acting on the legislation, the governor in fact pulled off a “pocket veto,” killing the bill. However, legislative leaders and opponents of the governor say that is not how it works in Maine and that LePage’s inaction actually means the bill has become law. [Maine Beacon]

23 seasons
Comedy Central renewed “South Park” for three more seasons, which will bring the show through 2019 and 23 seasons. [Variety]

45 percent
The percentage of U.S. companies that log their employees’ keystrokes, according to an American Management Association survey. That’s one way employers have increased their monitoring of workers. [The Week]

46-0
Vanuatu crushed Micronesia 46-0 in a men’s soccer Olympic qualifying tournament. Interestingly, Vanuatu had to run up the score against Micronesia in its quest to avoid elimination from the tournament. It didn’t work. [The Guardian]

90 cities
Taco Bell is now a delivery option for customers in 90 cities in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas metropolitan areas. This ends very badly for me in several months after the service rolls out in Jersey City — I can see it now. [Eater]

$230,000
A Texas woman who was hounded by robocalls from Time Warner Cable was awarded $230,000 by a judge after she sued the company. In related news, justice is real in the world. [Associated Press]

1 month
Bangkok, Thailand, is in the middle of a water crisis, with the city’s tap water supply in danger of running out within a month if there isn’t any rain. [Thomson Reuters Foundation]


15 cases

There’s an outbreak of rabbit fever (tularemia) among Coloradans, the result of a particularly good year for the wild rabbit’s elusive prey, vegetation. With more vegetation, rabbits are making even more rabbits, increasing the risk to humans of contracting the relatively rare disease. [Associated Press]


56 percent
That’s the proportion of traffic to larger websites that originates from bots like Google’s Web crawlers and programs designed to look like humans, according to a study published this year by a Web security company. The whole Internet traffic game — determining who gets seen and how much — is a shockingly murky enterprise, with lots of different ways for thumbs to get on the scales. [FiveThirtyEight]


60 trainees
In May, the U.S. government launched a program to train up to 5,400 Syrian opposition fighters per year to combat the Islamic State militant group. In testimony before Congress on Tuesday, the secretary of defense acknowledged that the U.S. was so far training only about 60, which is a little larger than an NFL team roster but nowhere near big enough to field an orchestra. Quiver in fear before our mighty force, ISIS! There are about as many fighters in “Super Smash Bros. 4.” [The Daily Star]


$74.95


The MSRP for a forthcoming edition of Risk stylized as the continents from “Game of Thrones.” Unfortunately, there are no Greyjoy sigil armies available, so I will just drink Kraken on the sidelines and casually flip over pieces when nobody is looking. [The Wall Street Journal]

The probability of a given ticket winning the Powerball lottery jackpot will drop in October to 1 in 292,201,338 from its current probability of 1 in 175,223,510. [The Buffalo News]

$1 billion per minute of trading

The Chinese stock market is tanking at an impressive rate, losing almost $1 billion for each minute of trading on mainland exchanges over a three-week period. Official sources are blaming foreign investors and short sellers. But the data? Yeah, that explanation doesn’t make sense considering actual volume. [Bloomberg]

$3.28 billion
That’s the 2014 global sales figure for Oreos, which dominate the cookie market. This week, there’s a new addition to the Oreo product line — Thins, which have fewer calories than the originals. [The Washington Post]

12 feet high
Boston had a rough winter. There’s still a 12-foot-high pile of ice and detritus left over from the city’s record snowfall, the remnants of a 75-foot-high pile. [The New York Times]


18 percent

A class-action lawsuit alleges that the New York Police Department has issued 850,000 unjustified summonses as part of a quota system. New filings in the case charge that the city has not turned over any emails from the files of the former police commissioner or former chief of department on the topic of summonses, which is a little peculiar. Attorneys in the lawsuit are alleging evidence destruction. A recent study out of John Jay College found that 18 percent of summonses from 2003 to 2013 were dismissed because of legal insufficiency. [New York Daily News]

37-3
The South Carolina Senate voted 37-3 to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state Capitol. Should the state’s House of Representatives agree, it will be the second time that South Carolina has had to move the Confederate flag because of external pressure. [The Post and Courier]

1,900 arrests
Madhya Pradesh, a state in India, is in the middle of a scandal over allegations that thousands of people since 2007 have paid bribes to have their results on exams to score government jobs and positions in medical schools changed. There have been lots of arrests. [Quartz]

A solar-powered plane completed a 5,061-mile trip across the Pacific from Japan to Hawaii in 118 hours — making it the longest solo nonstop flight ever. [Engadget]

$20,000 fine


Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is pushing legislation that would toughen the penalties for telemarketers that violate the national “Do Not Call” list. If the bill becomes law, companies who push robocalls without getting prior written consent will be hit with a fine of up to $20,000 for each violation, up to 10 years in prison, or both.

176 school districts
There are still 176 U.S. school districts (of about 13,500 total) that are under federal oversight to ensure that they continue to uphold desegregation. One of them is in Jefferson County, Alabama, and, wouldn’t you know, it appears a bunch of white families are trying to break off from the Jefferson County district to form a new district. [The Nation]

52,172 feet
Altitude attained by an engineless, experimental glider Sunday, a new record. The Perlan Project — sponsored by flight heavyweights like Airbus, Weather Extreme Ltd., United Technologies and BRS Aerospace — seeks to get an unpowered glider to heights of 90,000 feet. [USA Today]

$100,000
Amount spent by a pro-Kremlin “troll farm” on divisive Facebook advertising in advance of the 2016 presidential election, according to a blog post by Facebook spurred by the inquiry into Russian tampering in the election. [The Washington Post]

144,352 tons of tomatoes per square mile
The Netherlands has been investing in new and improved ways to maximize the efficiency of humane farming. Acre for acre, the Dutch are the best on earth: using greenhouses they get 144,352 tons of tomatoes out of every square mile, with the closest runner up — Spain — getting a fraction of that. Essentially, the Dutch decided to be a food R&D lab for everyone else — the secret seems to be greenhouses — and the outcome is they export more food, judging by dollar value, than every country except the U.S. [National Geographic]

200,000 students
New York City Schools will offer lunch to an additional 200,000 students, making free breakfast and lunch available to all students in the 2017-18 school year. [ABC 7 New York]

10 million
Square feet of office space managed by the startup WeWork, which offers co-working spaces and — increasingly — the service of running offices they themselves do not own. The company is valued at close to $20 billion on paper, which (again, on paper) is higher than Boston Properties, the largest publicly-traded commercial real estate company out there. [Wired]

Sustained wind speeds of Hurricane Irma as of 2 p.m. Tuesday. Only one other Atlantic hurricane has ever been measured to have faster winds. No matter where Irma lands, it’s going to be dangerous. [Ars Technica]

200,000
Approximate number of Californians who were protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, roughly a quarter of the nationwide total. This is the same DACA policy that President Trump announced he intends to end, and the same California where Democrats plan to specifically target nine of the state’s 14 GOP congressional representatives in the 2018 midterms. Needless to say, DACA is going to come up. [Los Angeles Times]

1.397 million
Number of nonfarm jobs in Kansas in April 2008. Today, that figure is 1.400 million nonfarm jobs. But while that number has been flat in Kansas in recent years, the rest of the country has enjoyed solid net employment growth. So, relative to the rest of the country, Kansas’s job market has taken a meaningful downward turn. [Bradford Delong]

President Trump is considering ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects 800,000 people who were children when they came to the United States as undocumented immigrants. One plan under consideration gives Congress six months to replace DACA before ending legal protections for the group. [The New York Times]

28 deals
The New York Daily News has been purchased by Tronc Inc., the company with the third-dumbest name in the industry. Tronc owns the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun. Last year 50 newspapers changed ownership across 28 deals. [Bloomberg]

Hurricane Irma, a category 4 storm in the Atlantic, has already led to warnings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Island and an emergency declaration in Florida. Meteorologists say it has a higher than 50 percent chance of impacting Florida. [Buzzfeed]

3,000
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party was allegedly hit with 3,000 cyberattacks Sunday, some of which could be traced back to Russian IP addresses. Gosh, it would seem now would be a great time for any Western democracy who has endured Russian meddling in its election to stand up and give a clear reckoning of what happened. [The New York Daily News]

59 million
Number of people in the U.S. and Canada who play fantasy sports, according to a trade group. I am one of them, and given that I have two different drafts tonight, you can expect tomorrow’s Significant Digits to include overzealous cheerleading of Kareem Hunt’s limited statline in an attempt to overcompensate for my taking him early in the second round like the chump I truly am!

3.2 percent
This summer was bad for movies; the third-quarter domestic box office haul is projected to fall 21 percent short of last year’s summer season. A strong first quarter, and an expectedly strong fourth quarter, will likely keep the movie business from hitting a disastrous shortfall, but 2017 box office receipts are projected to come in down 3.2 percent compared to 2016. [The Hollywood Reporter]

5 starters
Number of starters returning to Michigan’s college football team this year, the fewest of any lineup in the country. The team ranks 127th out of 130 teams in experience, thanks to that attrition. Still, they enter the season ranked 11th overall, so let’s see what they can pull off. (College football is back this weekend!) [FiveThirtyEight]

3.5 million unauthorized accounts
It turns out that the number of unauthorized customer and small business bank accounts illicitly opened by Wells Fargo is 70 percent higher than originally indicated. An independent investigation of the 165 million retail accounts opened from January 2009 through September 2016, found 3.5 million that were potentially unauthorized, up from the original figure of 2.1 million. [CNBC]

$876 million
Republicans in the House had been looking to cut $876 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account. They seem likely to reconsider given Hurricane Harvey and the abysmal optics associated with gutting disaster aid right after a major natural disaster. But the $876 million cut had been planned to fund a portion of President Trump’s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. [AP News]

$1.2 billion
Jared Kushner’s family’s real estate company spent $1.8 billion to buy 666 Fifth Avenue in New York at the height of the housing bubble. Now, Kushner Cos. is scrambling to find a way to secure its financial future. The company holds half of the $1.2 billion mortgage on the building. It hasn’t paid any of that, and the full amount is due in February 2019. [Bloomberg]

61.5 billion kroner
Dong Energy — which stands for Danish Oil and Natural Gas — is getting out of the oil and natural gas business and moving completely to renewables. They’re now in the process of selling off their last oil and gas fields. And since 2011, the company has spent 61.5 billion kroner (exchange rates always move but that’s on the order of $10 billion) on wind farms and 4 billion on converting its power plants to use biomass.

Bad news for the people in Thornton, Colorado, waiting for a new public safety facility on 132nd Avenue and Quebec Street: Work will be delayed because of a triceratops that is in the way. Workers uncovered the rare fossil while breaking ground, and now all sorts of scientists and museum curators are involved. [KDVR]

27 years
Alf Clausen, the composer on “The Simpsons” for the past 27 years, has been fired from the program. The longtime animated sitcom has been on a cost-cutting stint recently, but Clausen and his orchestra’s contributions to the show have been massive: They’ve been nominated for nearly two-dozen Emmy’s and have won two. [Vulture]

82 percent
A study of work-related activity found that employees use macOS (Apple’s operating system) while doing work on desktops 25 percent of the time. But Apple really dominates mobile work, 82 percent vs. Android’s 18 percent. [Computerworld]

465,000 people
Number of people in the U.S. with pacemakers that are vulnerable to being hacked, and thus need a firmware update. That’s obviously worrisome news, and I hope those people visit a doctor soon to get everything fixed. But the situation is also a great pitch for the kind of C-to-C-minus “Black Mirror” episode we’re going to start seeing when the show takes a dip after Season 7. [Ars Technica]

$1 million in looted Army weapons
According to testimony in federal court this week, over $1 million worth of stolen military equipment made its way to buyers in Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico and other countries after getting sold on the black market, including through some site on “dark web” called “eBay.” The equipment was allegedly stolen from Fort Campbell in Kentucky.

21.8 million comments
A study of the 21.8 million comments submitted to the Federal Communications Commission about repealing net neutrality rules found that 60 percent were against the FCC chair’s plan to overturn the status quo to benefit internet service providers, and 39 percent were in favor. But the difference is way more stark if you don’t count spam and form letters: 1.52 million comments against repealing the current regulations and a mere 23,000 in favor. [Ars Technica]

135,335 test subjects
A study published in The Lancet backs up my pre-existing ideas about the dangers of a high carbohydrate diet. So, I’m including the study in my newsletter despite the deep skepticism you should apply to all new nutrition studies. Indeed, the study was conducted with food frequency questionnaires, which have a lot of limitations. (Quick! How many cups of ribs did you eat last week?) But the study did feature 135,335 people, which is a lot, and they found that eating a ton of carbs was associated with an increased risk of mortality. [The Lancet, via The Week]

0.08 percent
Amazon began overhauling Whole Foods on Monday — its first day as owner — by slashing prices. Amazon’s entry into the $800 billion supermarket biz has been fascinating, especially looking at its effects: Wal-Mart has added more fresh fruit; Costco more organics. Investors are reacting too. Kroger stock is down 37 percent this year (although, it was essentially flat yesterday), and Sprouts Farmers Market’s stock dropped 10 percent on Monday alone. Amazon shares rose 0.08 percent. [Bloomberg]

“100 percent” cheese
A U.S. judge dismissed a whole pile of litigation against Kraft Heinz, Target, Wal-Mart and Supervalu on Monday. Customers had sued for misleading Parmesan cheese labeling, claiming that “100 percent grated Parmesan cheese” obscured the fact that the cheese also contained a bunch of percents of wood pulp. In throwing out the lawsuits, the judge pointed to the ingredients clearly listed on the back of each container, and — because the law is where pedantry goes to thrive — said that the 100 percent claim “could also be taken to mean 100 percent of the cheese was Parmesan or that the Parmesan cheese was 100 percent grated.” [Reuters]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the numbers tucked inside the news. Today, we’re focusing on the effects of Hurricane Harvey (now a tropical storm).

3 miles per hour
Tropical Storm Harvey is very slowly creeping back toward the Gulf of Mexico. But it was moving at only three miles per hour as of early Monday, so Southeast Texas, where Harvey made landfall, is still in danger. At least five deaths, and many more injuries, have been attributed to the storm. [Dallas Morning News, The New York Times]

50 inches of rain
With Harvey expected to remain around Southeast Texas for the next several days, cumulative rainfall in isolated parts of Texas could reach 50 inches. This would be the highest ever recorded in the state. The National Weather Service is describing the storm’s effects as unprecedented. [The Washington Post, NWS]

15 to 25 inches of rain
Additional rain forecasted to fall in the Houston area through Friday. [KHOU]

18 counties
As of Sunday, 18 counties in Texas were covered by the federal disaster declaration. Nearly 7 million of the state’s 27.8 million residents live in those counties. Fifty counties have been declared state disaster zones. [The Associated Press]

56,000 calls to 911
The city of Houston had received some 56,000 calls to 911 as of mid-day Sunday. Houston did not issue an evacuation order — it was decided that moving the 6.5 million people who live in the metro area by roads one day ahead of a major hurricane was unrealistic, and risked greater loss of life than the alternative.

5 turbines
New Orleans, to some notoriety, is low-lying, which leaves it particularly susceptible to flooding. To prevent that, the city relies on five turbines that power 120 pumps. As Hurricane Harvey threatens New Orleans from the Gulf of Mexico, however, 15 of those pumps are offline. Also, three of those five turbines are not working.

The state of Iowa will give Apple $208 million in tax breaks in exchange for promising to create at least 50 jobs as part of a $1.4 billion datacenter project near Des Moines. Iowa, I will gladly hire a personal assistant in the Des Moines area if you give me $4 million dollars in tax incentives. [Yahoo]

9,500 respondents
Number of participants in a survey intended to determine how Canada talks. It turns out Canada has a staggering array of regional distinctions in language, and we’re not just talking about the whole “occasional French” thing. (The survey only covered English speakers.) For instance, the East calls them sneakers, the West calls them runners, but Ontario and Quebec call them running shoes. As a U.S. resident, I was surprised to learn that only Nova Scotia and Quebec call them “coloured pencils”; apparently the drawing implements are referred to as “pencil crayons” in most of the rest of the country. [The 10 and 3]

Size of the U.S. youth sports market, which has grown 55 percent since 2010. Cheap little leagues are out, pricey private coaching and travel leagues are in. [TIME]

9.4 percent
Decline in sales of new homes in July compared to June. The drop, an 8.9 percent fall compared to a year ago, was a surprise — economists were anticipating a small gain. New housing inventory is at its highest level since 2009, with 276,000 units on the market. [CNBC]

15
Weeks that “Despacito” has spent at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Just one further week and the song will tie a record set by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men in the mid-1990s. Carey’s fans are really pulling for Cardi B or Taylor Swift to unseat the song of the summer before the record has a chance to change hands. [Into, Billboard]

20 inches
Texas and Louisiana appear to be in the path of Hurricane Harvey, and the National Hurricane Center anticipates heavy rains in the region with a chance of bad flooding. The current forecast has a possibility of over 20 inches of rain before next Wednesday, which would be more than enough to cause severe flooding in some areas. [Grist]

75 percent
Percentage of the sand on California beaches that originated from the state’s rivers and streams — that is, before those rivers were aggressively dammed up. One side effect of the state’s dam use is that 2.7 billion cubic yards of sand has been trapped that otherwise would have made its way to the sea. [EE News]

There are more than 12,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, roughly 3,500 more than the Pentagon officially acknowledges. The difference comes from service members on shorter trips to the war zone who are not counted in the publicly disclosed number. [The Wall Street Journal]

5-2
THEY DID IT! The U.S. women’s national team has won the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, trouncing Japan in one of those games that you can throw in the faces of people who think there’s no scoring in soccer. Going into the tournament final, FiveThirtyEight’s forecasting model had the team’s chances of winning at 67 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]


18 weeks
The U.S. Navy is extending to 18 weeks the amount of paid maternity leave available to female sailors and Marines. The Navy says about 5,000 women will be eligible each year. [Associated Press]


54 percent
Health insurers are trying to crank up rates in states across the country. In Minnesota, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are pursuing an average 54 percent hike, but that’s on the high end of the spectrum nationally. The proposed increases range from 20 percent to 40 percent or higher, according the The New York Times. State insurance regulators will have some ability to prevent such large increases from going into effect. [The New York Times]


61 percent

Oxi! In a referendum, Greeks soundly rejected a bailout deal from the country’s creditors that would have led to greater austerity measures. According to preliminary figures from the government, 61 percent voted “no” on the ballot measure. [Business Insider]

More than 30,000

That’s the number of federal inmates who have responded to the Obama administration’s call for clemency applications. Over the next couple of weeks, President Obama may bring the total number of commutations he has granted during his presidency to more than 80 as he acts to reduce the sentences of some nonviolent drug offenders. [The New York Times]

$75,000


A master of disguise pulled off a $75,000 heist from a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma. He dressed up as an armored truck driver, pretended to be at the store to pick up a gigantic pile of money, and then sped off in his Chevrolet Malibu. [News On 6]


1.6 million
Tanning beds — you know, that product that allows you to exchange your future skin health for not looking like a pasty cave-dwelling Excel power user at the beach — are on the decline. In 2013, about 1.6 million fewer women and 400,000 fewer men used tanning beds, compared with 2010. [New York Magazine]

$30.9 million

Four weeks on, and “Jurassic World” is somehow still leading the weekly box office. That “Terminator” sequel failed to bring audiences back, and “Inside Out” has yet to overcome the timeless story of guys who probably should have been more cautious when making dinosaurs. [Bloomberg]

$3.53 billion

That’s the amount of money that drug and medical device companies disclosed that they paid doctors between August 2013 and December 2014. Let those friends from college who were always on the prowl for Xanax know that there is a now a whole database of doctors in their area who took money to promote all those drugs. [ProPublica]

 $2.8 trillion
Markets in China are reeling from a stock market slide, with more than $2.8 trillion in value being wiped out on the Shanghai Composite Index since June 12. The country is taking several steps — like suspending IPOs — to try to stop the drop. [Bloomberg]

The semifinal game between England and Japan ended in heartbreak for Britons, with an own-goal in stoppage time ending the Lionesses’ run. [ESPN FC]


5.3 percent

“Magic Mike XXL” is out in theaters, and you should see it both because Channing Tatum has abs that can probably open jars, and because “Magic Mike” was actually a pretty accurate look into a crucial sector of the American economy. The strip club industry derives 5.3 percent of its revenue from women. [FiveThirtyEight]

67 percent


It’s the United States versus Japan in the final of the FIFA Women’s World Cup this Sunday. According to our model, the United States is favored to win the match and the tournament with a 67 percent chance of victory. Still, don’t get too cocky: Japan should still win this game one out of three times. If you want a primer on the team, definitely check out Allison McCann talking to current members of the squad from earlier in the tournament. [FiveThirtyEight]


250 students
Sweet Briar University, a private all-women’s college in Virginia, was saved from closing after a dedicated alumni campaign. Still, the premature closing announcement meant that only 250 students will be returning to campus this fall, down from 561 students last year. [Bloomberg]


600 feet

Comet 67P, where the European Space Agency sent the Rosetta probe and harpooned a lander, is littered with massive sinkholes 600 feet deep. I’m pretty sure this renders the “drillers have to become astronauts to dig 800 feet into an asteroid” plot of “Armageddon” effectively moot. Finally, science standing up to a Michael Bay movie. [The Los Angeles Times]

$45 million
The campaign of Hillary Clinton raised about $45 million since its launch, which is a stack of dough the size of an incumbent president’s. At press time, Iowa local TV news station owners were presumably checking if a shiny new Doppler radar is eligible for Amazon Prime. [ABC News]

$935 million

One side effect of all those comic book movies we keep seeing is that comic book sales are bananas again. Last year they hit mid-1990s sales levels, after adjusting for inflation. About $835 million came from physical sales of comic books and graphic novels and another $100 million from digital sales. [Comichron]

1.89 kills per cat per month


It’s crucial to remember that house cats are descended from a line of apex predators and that the urge to hunt never fully left them. New research in the “Ecology and Evolution” journal suggests that outdoor cat owners vastly underestimate the efficient killing machines in their care. In a study of British cats and their owners, the mean number of things a cat kills every month was 1.89. The cats’ owners, meanwhile, had no idea how many things their own cats were killing. Keep them inside, people. The birds don’t stand a chance otherwise. [Ecology and Evolution via Gizmodo]

THE UNITED STATES WOMEN’S NATIONAL TEAM BEAT GERMANY IN THE SEMIFINALS AND NOW THE TEAM IS GOING TO THE WOMEN’S WORLD CUP FINALS. We told you it was going to be the best game ever. [ESPN]


22 dildos

Earlier this week, the single greatest CNN segment in CNN’s history went on the air. It was a discussion of a purported ISIS flag at an LGBT pride event in London — a discussion that was later invalidated when the flag was revealed to be comprised of dildos rather than legitimate Arabic text. By my count there are 22 distinct dildos represented on the flag, all arranged to appear to look like the banner of the brutal contingent that has assumed control of portions of Syria, Iraq and other areas. Its craftsman is now speaking out about his motivation. [The Guardian]

65th show
Billy Joel will break Elton John’s record for number of shows played at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night. [Newsday]


124 people 
The number of people killed by police this year who were suffering from mental illness or undergoing an emotional crisis. That’s out of 462 total by the Washington Post’s reckoning. One potential cause of this, the Post reports, is that police don’t spend enough time learning how to assist the emotionally disturbed. [The Washington Post]


25,000
The estimated number of annual deaths caused by sugary beverages, according to new research in an American Heart Association journal. Worldwide, the annual death toll is estimated to be 180,000. [The Los Angeles Times]


€802,079
A crowdfunding campaign to raise 1.6 billion euros for Greece — enough to pay the nation’s most recent missed debt payment — has raised €802,079 at press time from 47,570 people who do not quite get how much a billion euros is, or are maybe all in on a joke to show how dumb crowdfunding is. I can’t really tell. [Indiegogo]

$2 million

The estimated salary cap for the 2015-2016 NBA season was $67.1 million for each team, but the actual cap could be $2 million higher. The negotiation period for free agents begins midnight Wednesday, so figuring out how to deal with the still-nebulous cap is likely on general managers’ minds. [CBS Sports]

 52.6 million

The United States has eclipsed Spain to be the nation with the second-highest number of Spanish speakers, behind only Mexico. An estimated  52.6 million Americans speak Spanish. [New York Daily News]

$500 million

I got into this business for a couple of reasons, but none of them were because I wanted to write a daily newsletter that regularly talked about Donald Trump. And yet, here we stand. The presidential candidate and former television personality is suing Univision in a $500 million defamation, breach of contract and free speech lawsuit. [The Hollywood Reporter]

2/3 in each chamber

The Post and Courier in South Carolina called up state legislators and asked how they’d vote on a proposal to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds. In order to get it passed, a two-thirds majority is required in each chamber of the state legislature. Yesterday, by the paper’s count, that threshold was reached. [The Post and Courier via @jaspar]

6 fires

Up to six fires have taken place at black churches in the south in the past week and a half. The FBI is investigating. [NPR]

53 percent

70 percent of academic papers in social science and 53 percent of papers in natural and medical science are published by the top five for-profit journal publishers. This is potentially an issue because the for-profit journals limit access compared to open source counterparts. [CBC]

70 percent
Rare-earth metals — the weird ones on the middle chunk of the periodic table that sound like sensible Targaryen names and make your phone work — exploded as a commodity investment a few years ago due to perceived scarcity. In retrospect, the high prices for the commodities and the rush of companies trying to exploit that scarcity were symptoms of a bubble. China controls 70 percent of the supply of rare-earth elements. [Bloomberg]


$52,000


President Obama’s Labor Department intends to announce a plan to mandate overtime pay for more workers. Mandatory overtime pay could now potentially be owed to people making as much as $52,000, up from its current level of $23,660. Until now those people have not been assured time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours per week. [NPR]


$79,229.09
Gawker is trying to get emails pertaining to the incident in McKinney, Texas where a police officer brandished a weapon at several unarmed black teenagers and subsequently resigned. They filed a Public Information Act request, and the city said fulfilling the request for records and emails would cost $79,229.09. That’s a lot of money for what is essentially a “Ctrl+F,” “Ctrl+C” and “Ctrl+V” operation. [Gawker]


$2.75 million

That’s the amount of money transferred from Phil Mickelson, the golfer, to a sports gambling handicapper working for an illegal gambling operation. Mickelson has not been charged with anything, but the handicapper has pleaded guilty to money laundering. [ESPN]

$14.5 million
The archdiocese of Los Angeles is trying to sell a former convent to Katy Perry for $14.5 million. The nuns who used to occupy that convent claim that’s not possible because they sold the property two weeks ago to a restaurant owner. I had a whole sentence of Katy Perry song puns ready here, but I’m holstering it. Not worth the roar in my inbox. [Gawker]


26 million
The number of people who have emblazoned a rainbow flag on their Facebook profile to celebrate the Supreme Court’s decision to extend marriage rights to all Americans. [The Washington Post]


$470 million
Uber doesn’t make money, which isn’t particularly shocking — companies like Uber are motivated by growth and not profit at this stage of existence. But wow, does it not make money. According to a report distributed to prospective investors, during an undefined time period the company incurred $470 million in losses while bringing in $415 million in revenue. Uber says the numbers are out of date. [Bloomberg]

7th resupply
A SpaceX rocket launch failed Sunday when the rocket appeared to disintegrate about two minutes into the flight. It was SpaceX’s seventh delivery of goods to the International Space Station. [CNN]

53 percent
Airbnb is often times less “bed and breakfast” and more “people just live here.” An analysis of Airbnb in New York found that 53 percent of listings are rented upwards of 60 nights per year and three in ten are managed by people with multiple listings. Funny, that sounds a lot like the job description of a landlord. [Gothamist]


61 seconds

Since the earth is ever so slightly slowing its spin, we need to adjust time based on the atomic clock every now and again through “leap seconds.” On June 30, one of those leap seconds is going to take place. You probably won’t notice. But high frequency traders and financial markets might! So lots of work is going into prepping markets for the 61-second long minute. [Bloomberg]

577 shooting victims

Shootings are up in New York in the first half of the year; 577 people have been shot between January 1 and June 14th. That’s 10 percent higher than the same time period last year. [DNA Info]

Filmmaker Michael Moore has offered to pay any fines and legal costs for the pair. [Michigan Live]

New technology behind stun cuffs — which are a pair of handcuffs that can be remotely triggered to give a severe electric shock to the wearer — is raising a lot of questions about how much the prison system should look like a dystopian novel from the ’50s. [The Atlantic]


237,000 rental units
There are 237,000 rental units in San Francisco. About 72 percent of them are rent controlled. That’s nice, because rent in San Francisco is absolutely bananas and liable to rapid rises. But if you’re one of the 28 percent, you are doomed to a wretched existence bound only to the whims of a real estate market content to devour itself. [San Francisco Chronicle]



$1.8 billion

That’s the payment Greece has to make to the IMF on Tuesday. It is not looking good. [BBC]


$73 billion

Forget Greece — Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory, has its own debt crisis. The territory owes $73 billion, has a sluggish economy, and is going to have to negotiate its way out of a potential default as several potentially crippling bond payments are on the horizon. [The Guardian]

CORRECTION (June 29, 8:19 a.m.): An earlier version of this post wrote that Greece owed the IMF $1.6 billion. That’s the amount of euros it owes; the dollar amount is $1.8 billion.

4.8 percent drop

AB InBev, the biggest beer company on the globe, is buying up craft breweries, in part because the company’s main offerings are down. In 2013, Budweiser shipments fell 4.8 percent in North America. [Bloomberg]

6-3

The biggest news yesterday was the 6-3 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Affordable Care Act. The effect was drastic and immediate from a markets standpoint, with the stocks of the five largest insurers jumping minutes after the decision. By 11 a.m., the decision had added about $3 billion to the combined market capitalization of the companies. [FiveThirtyEight]

8 percentage points
That’s the lead Hillary Clinton has on Sen. Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, according to a CNN poll released yesterday. Clinton used to be ahead by more. But this isn’t the first time a poll has shown Sanders closing in on Clinton, and she is still heavily favored to win New Hampshire and the nomination. [FiveThirtyEight]


14 percent
According to newly released CDC data from 2011, an estimated 14 percent of HIV positive people did not know they were infected. People who don’t know they have HIV are responsible for about a third of new transmissions of the virus. [The Verge]

18 days

With only 18 days to go until the Miss USA pageant, Univision announced it will not air the event. This is because Donald Trump — you know, the fellow who is No. 2 in Republican primary polls in New Hampshire — is a part-owner of the pageant and also made derisive comments recently about Mexico. When Trump gets a 3 a.m. phone call saying his pageant won’t be on TV, will he be ready to lead? [TIME]


43.4 percent
Retractions appear to be on the rise in scientific journals, but that may not mean people are getting worse at their jobs. From the early 2000s through 2012, the percentage of articles retracted from PubMed due to suspected fraud tripled to 43.4 percent. But, there’s evidence this is because the community is getting better at identifying fraud rather than getting more fraudulent. [Priceonomics and PNAS]

The pay of CEOs at America’s companies is up 54 percent since the economic recovery began in 2009; the average employee’s earnings are totally flat. [The Guardian]

8,678 cases
Wish-Bone Ranch Salad Dressing — the liquid that fuels this great nation — has had a catastrophic mix up, and 8,678 cases of what is probably most Americans’ main source of Vitamin E are being recalled. Those cases were mislabeled and are actually bleu cheese dressing, not Ranch. When will our national nightmare end? [Fox Connecticut]

A jury in New Jersey yesterday found an institution selling itself as an “ex-gay” therapy center guilty of defrauding customers. The defendants will have to pay $72,400 in damages. [Mic]

Gov. Bobby Jindal’s approval rating among Louisiana Republicans has dropped 25 percentage points since 2012, and Jindal, who announced he’s running for president Wednesday, is joining a crowded field and polling below Donald Trump.

Gang-smuggled meat. That’s what Chinese custom officials are dealing with. Those officials have seized more than 100,000 tons of frozen meat, and some of it is more than 40 years old, reportedly. I am not a butcher, but I assure you that is not how to age meat properly. [NPR]


77 percent
The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs launched a “sting operation” involving 120 grocery stores all over town to find out how many were overcharging consumers for pre-packaged food priced by the pound. Of the 80 types of food tested at Whole Foods, every one had an inaccurate label according to the agency, and 77 percent of grocery stores overall were hit with at least one violation. [New York Daily News]


92 percent favorable
Did you know that the Philippines thinks the United States is great? I did not! The U.S. has a 92 percent favorable in the Philippines, the highest in a new Pew survey of 39 countries. The Philippines even makes Canada look like that friend that never texts us back. Oh, also, Russia hates our guts. [Pew Research Center]

Fun fact: Human activity releases roughly 100 times as much carbon dioxide as global volcanic activity does. Wait, that’s not a fun fact. That’s not fun at all, really. Either way, global warming isn’t because of volcanos. [Bloomberg]


250 lobbyists

That’s how many lobbyists Uber has registered in statehouses across the U.S., not even counting municipal lobbyists. Given how tightly regulated the transportation industry tends to be in metropolitan areas, the tech company has found a fairly old-school way of cutting through red tape. [Bloomberg]

$2.9 million
That’s New York City’s laughably tiny budget for rodent control. The day New York manages to control this city’s rats with that amount of money, I promise to take the ARC tunnel train into the city, skip on over to the Second Avenue Subway, take it to the West Side Stadium they built for the 2012 New York Summer Olympics and then eat my “Re-elect Trump 2020” hat in front of the entire New York Jets Super Bowl victory parade. [The New York Times]

$500,000

Doctors made fun of a patient while he was under anesthesia, and the patient sued for malpractice and was awarded $500,000. The patient originally wanted $1.75 million, but he received a middling $500,000 because two jurors — one thinking he should get nothing, one thinking he should get a lot more money — compromised and figured a half-mil should do the trick. [TIME]

At every possible opportunity, our military and government pursues — if not leads — the very state of the art, putting tax dollars to work.

Three American heroes who sky-dived from the roof of the nearly completed 1 World Trade Center tower in 2013 were each convicted of three misdemeanors for their awesome story. The jurors, presumably realizing they were in the presence of three stone-cold badasses, declined to convict them of the felony charge of burglary, because really the only thing the trio broke into was our hearts. Also, technically, 1 World Trade Center. They were convicted of two counts of reckless endangerment and also violating an ordinance against parachuting off buildings. That last one is particularly disappointing, because I did not realize such a law already existed in New York, and how rad would it be if the city had to make a new law specifically after these heroes, you know?

The U.S. women’s national team beat Colombia 2-0 in the first knockout round of the women’s World Cup on Monday. The U.S. squad will face China on Friday, and according to FiveThirtyEight’s model has an 88 percent chance of winning that game. Overall, the U.S. team now has a 32 percent chance of winning the tournament, slightly behind Germany, which has a 34 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]

That’s the percentage of the “facial aesthetic market” — Botox and whatnot — represented by men. Several companies are gunning for the “Brotox” market, trying to dial that share up a little higher. [Bloomberg]



15 percent

Municipal recycling is in a bit of a crisis at the moment, with a number of factors coming together that make it harder for companies to make a profit. Falling oil prices means that commodities prices are going down in general, and the decline in newspaper sales has also made a dent in profits. The one thing going right for recyclers is cardboard shipping boxes, which in the age of Amazon can account for 15 percent of a city’s recycling. [The Washington Post]

38 percent drop
Deaths from coronary heart disease are down 38 percent from 2003 to 2013, a result of declines in smoking, better cholesterol and blood pressure management, and superior treatments. Emergency room treatment for heart attacks has benefited from the use of data. [The New York Times]

Stonehenge may actually be way bigger than originally believed. Archaeologists using radar have located all sorts of huts and burial mounds, but have also found another monument consisting of upwards of 50 giant stones arranged around Stonehenge. [io9]


90 percent
A new cancer treatment that involves the removal, genetic engineering and subsequent reinsertion of T cells in the bloodstream has been making waves: According to the early results, 90 percent of patients treated with the method whose acute lymphoblastic leukemia had returned and had resisted other drugs went into remission. The usual rate is less than 10 percent. [MIT Technology Review]

Etsy banned the sale of spells and metaphysical goods, meaning that sellers can no longer peddle magic stuff on the Internet retailer. Keep it in Diagon Alley, people.

In the United States, black Americans are killed at 12 times the rate of people who live in other developed countries. What’s a developed country? The definition includes places such as Argentina, Cuba, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia that have high homicide rates. But for black Americans, the homicide rate is 19.4 deaths per year per 100,000 population. [FiveThirtyEight]

33
According to the FBI, there were 51 reported hate crimes in South Carolina in 2013, 33 of which were motivated by race. According to both the FBI’s and the Southern Poverty Law Center’s estimations, South Carolina is below the national average rate for reported hate crimes when you factor in population. My colleague Carl Bialik looked at the complicated nature of hate-crime statistics. [FiveThirtyEight]



49 percent
A survey from the Pew Research Center in 2013 found that 49 percent of whites saw no systemic racism towards black Americans at all. To break it down further, those 49 percent said they did not think blacks were treated less fairly in each of seven categories, including dealing with cops, the court system, jobs, restaurants, schools, health care and elections.

40 percent
Births to unwed mothers accounted for 40 percent of U.S. births in 2014, down from 41 percent in 2013 — the first drop since the 1990s. Part of this decline is due to people waiting longer to have children (older mothers are more likely to be married). The downward trend also coincides with a lower birthrate overall during the recession. [Pew Research Center]

234 waivers

It takes a lot of energy to pump water from the Colorado River across the Arizona wilderness and to the places where — for some reason — people decided to live, like in the middle of the desert in Phoenix and Tucson. The Navajo Generating Station pumps water 336 miles to those cities, but it’s also powered by 15 tons of coal per minute and singlehandedly accounts for 29 percent of the carbon emissions Arizona creates from generating energy.

Smoking kills, study finds. Well, it’s actually a little bigger than that. Researchers at the American Cancer Society — known all around the world for their profound anti-cancer bias — estimated that 167,805 of the 345,962 cancer deaths in 2011 were associated with smoking. That’s a little less than half. [Reuters]

UnitedHealth (the largest insurer) is trying to take over Aetna (the third-largest insurer) for somewhere in the neighborhood of $42 billion, and in response Anthem (the second-largest insurer) is trying to buy Cigna (the fifth-largest insurer). It’s all coming together as the equivalent of a paperwork-heavy summer camp movie ending.

The case revolved around a woman from Waterloo, Iowa, who was arrested in 2013 for being drunk in public. She had a blood alcohol content of 0.267 percent.

A FIFA-produced Sepp Blatter biopic made $607 in its 10-theater U.S. premiere, far short of its $29 million budget.

An estimate from the Social Security Administration says that about 12,200 living Americans are inaccurately declared dead by the agency every year due to keystroke errors.

The low price of petroleum is hitting U.S. drillers in North Dakota and Texas, with shale output dropping 1.3 percent this month. Output is forecast to drop further by July, according to the Energy Information Administration. [Bloomberg]

$175 million
Jay Faison, a North Carolina-based entrepreneur, announced he will commit $175 million to a campaign to get the Republican Party to change its — “skeptical,” as Politico puts it — views on climate change and green energy. There are probably worse ways to destroy $175 million than charging windmills. [Politico]

American Pharoah, the horse, won the Belmont Stakes on Saturday in under two and a half minutes, securing a Triple Crown win. He is the 12th horse to do so. Good for him! People are very happy for the horse. His descendants will now be more expensive to procure than they would have been otherwise. [CNN]

3 years
Chris Dodd was elected to a three-year contract extension as the head of the Motion Picture Association of America. [The New York Times]


12 percent drop
A survey by the Associated Press found a 12 percent decrease in abortions across 45 states since 2010. [Associated Press]


20th 

Serena Williams won the French Open on Saturday, the 20th Grand Slam title of her career. [ESPN]


41 percent

In elections this past weekend, Turkey saw a large drop in support for the party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With 41 percent of the vote, the AKP won a plurality but lost its majority in Parliament. [The New York Times]





46 cents

After a court ruling, the U.S. Postal Service must reverse a hike in postage for first-class letters. USPS raised the price of a stamp to 49 cents from 46 cents last year (essentially justifying your irrational decision to load up on Forever stamps a couple of years back), but the direct-mail industry fought back. [MSN]



193

Number of individuals who have signed onto the Warren Buffett-Bill Gates pledge to give away half their net worth in life or death. [Bloomberg]

70,000 pounds of bacon
An Amtrak train crashed into a truck hauling 70,000 pounds of bacon, about six days’ supply at my house. [NBC Chicago]

9 downgrades
We’re going to hear a lot about fiscal conservatism from the crowd vying for the GOP nomination — the governors alone could field a baseball team — so one thing worth looking at is the fiscal health of states while the candidates were leading them. NPR examined one proxy for a state’s financial and economic health, credit ratings, and found that all but one governor in the field saw their states’ ratings remain the same or improve. On the other hand, New Jersey’s credit rating has been downgraded three times by each of the three major credit rating agencies under Gov. Chris Christie. [NPR]






4 million


The personal data of 4 million current and former federal employees may have been stolen in a cybersecurity incident, U.S. officials said Thursday. Officials believe Chinese hackers were behind the breach. [CNN]



27.6 point difference
Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry formally entered the GOP nomination race Thursday. His previous presidential campaign experience makes him a bit of an outlier — he holds the record for the largest disparity between monthly national polling average (in the months before primary voting began) and actual vote share achieved during a primary. [FiveThirtyEight]


80 votes
Editorial employees of Gawker Media voted 80-27 to unionize under the Writers Guild of America, East. [Gawker]

133 Greek organizations

An analysis of fraternity and sorority suspensions, disbandments and punishments found that 133 chapters at 55 U.S. colleges were hit with penalties during the spring semester alone. [Bloomberg]

3.1 million
The number of viewers that Megyn Kelly’s Fox News interview with the Duggar family — of TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting” — had Wednesday night. It was the first time the Duggars had spoken to the media since details emerged about the sexual misconduct of their eldest son. [Associated Press]



5 million euros

The CEO of the Football Association of Ireland said FIFA paid the soccer organization 5 million euros to avoid a lawsuit over a French handball that kept Ireland out of the 2010 World Cup. FIFA, for what it’s word is worth, says the amount was $5 million, for a construction project. But in for a penny in for a pound, you know? [The Guardian]



$15.5 million

Brooklyn has a new record for the most expensive home sale: $15.5 million for a townhouse at 177 Pacific St. The previous record was $12.5 million for Truman Capote’s old haunt. [NY1]


$7 billion

Fun fact: The primary type of banana consumed by humans was eradicated from Earth in the 1950s because of a blight. The type of bananas that people eat today — Cavendish bananas — are a totally different type than the Gros Michel bananas that people noshed down in the 1940s. The issue is that all our eggs are once again in the same botanical basket, and if another banana plague were to sweep the world — like, say, the new banana fungus that has spread to Australia from Africa and Asia — we’d be reduced to plantains or some other alternative. The international banana market is worth more than $7 billion. [Bloomberg]

6 homes

An investigation from ProPublica and NPR found that despite hauling in almost half a billion dollars, the American Red Cross constructed only six permanent homes in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010. The Red Cross says it has used the money to help Haitians by repairing homes, providing clean water and vaccinations, and through other assistance projects. [NPR]

8 ounces

Assuming that you’re willing to wait four to eight business days, Amazon will now ship items that weigh 8 ounces or less to you for free. [The Verge]

10 times sharper

Earth is getting a new, awesome telescope. Upwards of $500 million in international funding was announced Wednesday for the Giant Magellan Telescope, which will try to find Earth-like planets around nearby stars. The telescope will produce images up to 10 times sharper than those from the Hubble Space Telescope. [The University of Arizona]


51 labs


Remember how the government apparently sent a live anthrax sample though the mail? Remember when it hedged on exactly which lab the live sample went to? Yeah, now we know why. The U.S. government actually sent live samples of anthrax to 51 labs in 17 states and three different nations. Fun fact: The preceding three sentences are now the logline on a disaster movie screenplay I just started working on. [Reuters]

61 percent
Sixty-one percent of respondents to a new poll said they think that only a few people at the top of the economic heap have a chance to get ahead. [The New York Times]

139 killings

$100,000
WikiLeaks is offering $100,000 for the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal — a classified document — and is attempting to crowdsource the money to pay the reward. [Reuters]

45,027,793

Notice that eggs are getting more expensive? That’s because as of Wednesday, bird flu had affected 45,027,793 chickens and turkeys in the U.S. since December. That is, incidentally, the logline for a second disaster movie screenplay I just started working on. It’s going to be a great summer. [USDA, via Bloomberg]



$12 billion
A new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that the revenue from electronic home-video rentals — through downloads and from streaming services like Netflix — will hit $12 billion in 2017, eclipsing U.S. box office revenue. [Bloomberg]

Shonda Rhimes, creator of the TV shows “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” has a book coming out in the fall called “Year of Yes” that is all about her taking on a yearlong challenge to say “yes” to experiences. That’s great. The issue? Well, for one thing, Maria Dahvana Headley’s book titled “The Year of Yes” about the author taking on a yearlong challenge to say “yes” to experiences was published in 2006. So that makes two “Year of Yes” books, I suppose. [Time, @MARIADAHVANA, via John Scalzi]

3 percent

Former New York Gov. George Pataki has exploded in popularity, at least compared with his negligible rounding error of a performance before the most recent round of polling. A CNN poll has him at 3 percent — which in fairness is the survey’s sampling error. [CNN (PDF)]

$13 per hour

Wal-Mart will raise the baseline starting wage for some managers, the retailer said Tuesday, several months after announcing increases in the minimum wages of some general employees. The pay range for managers of some departments will rise from $10.30-$20.09 per hour to $13-$24.70 in August; the minimum will then rise to $15 per hour in February. [The New York Times]

13.5 percent reduction

Residents of California, the dry state on everyone’s mind, reduced consumption of water by 13.5 percent in April, compared with the same month two years earlier. Gov. Jerry Brown has mandated that cities and towns cut water use by 25 percent. [Associated Press]


84 percent

That’s the percentage of people who believe money has too much influence in politics, according to a new poll. And Republicans and Democrats aren’t very far apart on this issue. So this means we solved it, right? We’re all on the same page? Not quite. See, while a lot of people think it, less than 1 percent care about it enough to make it a top priority. [The Washington Post]



128GB
SanDisk released a thumb drive smaller than a dime with a 128 gigabyte capacity, a substantial breakthrough for portable consumer storage. [Wired]


$4,225


That’s the median monthly rent in San Francisco. Median! Monthly! Rents in the area are up 16 percent year over year as of April. I sent this to several friends who are hardened New Yorkers, and even they were freaked out. We are worried about you, San Francisco. Please let us know if you need help. [SFGate]

 17 million

Annual album sales of contemporary Christian music in 2014, down from a peak of 50 million in the late 1990s. And while the story “album sales in genre decline” is not breaking news in the wondrous year of 2015, the way the genre’s transformation from mainstream music into a niche act gutted listenership is really interesting. [The Week]



$103.8 million
Quarterback Cam Newton has signed a $103.8 million, five-year extension with the Carolina Panthers. [ESPN]

$3.3 billion
Fitbit — the company behind the wearable fitness tracker that I once lost in an inebriated Fitbit throwing contest yet still feel odd nostalgia for — is planning for its initial public offering; it hopes to raise $478 million for a $3.3 billion valuation. Good for them. How I miss you, Fitty. [Bloomberg]

Caitlyn Jenner, who formerly went by Bruce, smashed President Obama’s record for the shortest time to gain 1 million followers on Twitter after debuting a new account Monday. [Associated Press]

13 gallons
Measuring the water debt incurred by various foodstuffs is all the rage these days, what with California’s dual status as a producer of lots of our food and the site of a historic and devastating drought. But the real question on all of our minds — well, mine at least — is how to ethically get drunk in such trying times. The answer is wine, which has a “water footprint” of 13 gallons per glass. That is less than the 14.5-gallon footprint of a bottle of beer. [Mother Jones]


$30

Estimated cost added per minute when a plane stands idle at the boarding gate, according to researchers from Northern Illinois University. This summer, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are experimenting with new boarding procedures designed to cut down on time squandered at the gate. [Associated Press]



57 percent 

Hawkish U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has entered the 2016 race for the GOP presidential nomination. Since 2013, more Republican voters have come to share Graham’s worldview: According to recent polling, 57 percent believe that U.S. anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough in protecting the country, up from 38 percent two years ago. [FiveThirtyEight]

More than 60 percent

The share of the Iranian population that is younger than 40, a group of people who appear to be more interested in change for their nation than their elders. Young people in Iran are engaged in a “silent movement” that is “defined by a style of life rather than politics,” according to the foreign editor of the Financial Times. [The Takeaway]



67 out of 70
The Transportation Security Administration is laughably incompetent when it comes to what amounts to basically its only job, failing 67 out of 70 times to catch undercover investigators smuggling imitation explosives and weapons through security checkpoints. [ABC News]

More than 490 minutes
The amount of time that people spend each day with media, primarily television, according to a new report. The Internet saw the largest growth over the past five years, with people, on average, doubling the time they spend online. [Quartz]


125 million copies
Guess what, America: “Fifty Shades of Grey” is back. Author E L James has a new offering for the series titled “Grey.” Barring an unforeseen kink in the plans, it will come out June 18. So far, 125 million copies of the books in the trilogy have been sold. [Variety]



 $17 billion

The amount of money in the reserves of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which is relatively flush after years without a hurricane in the state. This year’s hurricane season, which began June 1, is predicted to have fewer storms than normal. [Reuters]

10 percent
Some parts of Europe and Asia are seeing a rise in crime among seniors. In London, arrests of people 65 and older were up 10 percent from March 2009 to March 2014; in South Korea, crimes committed by people in that age group rose 12.2 percent from 2011 to 2013; and in Japan, crimes by people over 65 more than doubled from 2003 to 2013. The U.S. doesn’t appear to be experiencing this trend. [Bloomberg]

That’s how many people have been fatally shot by police officers in the United States in the first five months of 2015, about two killings per day, according to a Washington Post analysis. [The Washington Post]

The Senate voted to take up the USA Freedom Act, which would stop an NSA program that collects telephone data in bulk. [The Guardian]

$200,000
You’re supposed to recycle old electronics, but there’s probably an exception to be made for valuable vintage computers from the halcyon days of Silicon Valley. A recycling center received an original Apple I computer worth $200,000 from a mystery woman, and it’s trying to track the do-gooder down. [CBS San Francisco]

$10 million per year

NBC is in a bit of a pickle. It is trying to find a way to keep Brian Williams, who was suspended from his job at “NBC Nightly News” after questions were raised about his retellings of incidents that took place when he was reporting on the Iraq War. One option apparently being considered is to give Williams, whose current contract is reportedly worth $10 million per year over five years, a new role. [CNN Money]




$20.2 million
The value of Social Security benefits that were paid to suspected former Nazis and others who may have participated in the Third Reich’s atrocities. The payments were made to the more than 130 people between 1962 and 2015. [The Associated Press]


$400 million

The budget shortfall that Kansas is looking forward to next fiscal year, and with not a lot left to cut in the state budget, the GOP-controlled legislature may have to do the unspeakable: raise some taxes. [The New York Times]



$4.9 billion

The estimated amount of government subsidies that companies owned by Elon Musk — Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity — have reaped. [Los Angeles Times]

Nearly 8 years

Our long national nightmare is over: A judge has ended Lindsay Lohan’s probation, a legal saga that has lasted since 2007. The actress intends to return to working. I, for one, am looking forward to the Lohanaissance. [Associated Press]

9 labs

The Army announced Wednesday it mailed live samples of anthrax to several labs in the U.S. and South Korea. Thursday a spokesperson indicated that the samples may have been alive not because of human error, but instead because of a technical failure in killing all of the anthrax. The government is not saying which lab in which state got the live anthrax, but no one was hurt. [Associated Press]


$31.61


New research from the National Low Income Housing Coalition figured out how much workers need to earn per hour to rent a 2-bedroom apartment in each state. Hawaii had the highest needed wage, $31.61 per hour to sustain a two-bedder. [CityLab]

69 percent

Generally if you want to be elected President of the United States, you have to be a well-liked person. Donald Trump is not that person. The reality television show performer has scheduled a major announcement for June 16 — potentially that presidential bid — even though polling says he has a 69 percent unfavorable rating nationwide. [Quinnipiac]


$35,000

How much Washington D.C. will spend to study the effects of building a gondola system between Georgetown and Rosslyn across the Potomac River in Virginia. I have studied the matter and would be glad to tell the nation’s capital that gondolas are silly ways to travel for far less than $35,000. [Washington Post]

200,000 sharks fins
Authorities in Ecuador seized 200,000 shark fins in nine raids throughout the port of Manta. The fins were illegally bound for Asia, reportedly. [BBC]


$1.53 million

Average sale price in the 212 New York City area code for a resale condo or co-op in the first quarter of this year. A New York Times analysis found only 113 sale listings for units in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens or Manhattan with a view of water that were priced lower than $500,000. That’s in a city comprised largely of islands! [The New York Times]


$3.5 million
Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was charged with lying to the FBI. The former speaker allegedly attempted to discreetly pay someone $3.5 million to hush up “past misconduct.” [The New York Times]

$36 million
Canada will no longer charge general sales tax on feminine hygiene products effective July 1. The taxes on tampons, menstrual pads and other such products constituted a cash transfer from women to their government of about $36 million annually. [The Globe and Mail]

Serial, the hit podcast from This American Life’s Sarah Koenig, is recording not one, but two seasons simultaneously to follow up on its acclaimed first season. Time to fire up the ol’ FiveThirtyEight Serial insanity wall again. [The AV Club]

4 turtles
Only 4 Yangtze giant softshell turtles remain in the world — all in captivity, and all but one male. In a last-ditch effort scientists are resorting to artificially inseminating the 100-year-old female in order to save the species. No pressure or anything. [San Diego Zoo Blog]


21 pages


California has released the new standards it will enforce for workplace safety at pornographic film production sites. It’s 21 pages long and the basic gist is that now certain things are going to require goggles. Do the hirsute plumbers that the comely homeowner never ordered also now need to be licensed and insured? [Boing Boing]

28 percent decline

That’s how much the U.S. consumption of beef has dropped in the past three decades. One side effect of this? Leather is getting a lot more expensive, and U.S. businesses are feeling the squeeze. [Bloomberg]

30-19

A bill to abolish the death penalty in Nebraska has become law after the Nebraska senate overrode a gubernatorial veto 30-19. [KETV]


38 percent

A new survey from the Federal Reserve found that 31 percent of working adults have no retirement savings, and 38 percent have no intention to retire. Proving once again that it’s the baby boomers who are the irresponsible generation, a quarter of workers 45 and older have not planned pensions or retirement savings. [Reuters]

72,000 ladybugs

Seven brilliant innovators had their creativity stifled and vision squashed after they allegedly released 72,000 ladybugs in Chopticon High School in the dead of night as part of a senior prank. Now they face criminal charges. Six of them are students, and one of them is an alumnus of the high school, presumably taking on the mentoring and intellectually nurturing role we see so rarely in this country’s schools. I look forward to the inevitable GoFundMe to support their legal defense, which may not even be necessary as no jury in America could possibly consider these young people criminals when they have such good ideas. One of the seniors — who, in fairness, will presumably never have to buy a drink in the town of Morganza, Maryland again — will not be allowed to walk at graduation. [Associated Press]


More than 100,000 taxpayers

A group of hackers described by authorities as a sophisticated organized crime syndicate stole upwards of 100,000 U.S. taxpayers’ information through the IRS’s “Get Transcript” function. Thieves getting fraudulent refunds is a huge issue. The IRS estimates it paid out $5.8 billion in faked refunds in 2013. [Associated Press]


$160,000

The academic fraud that began with a retracted study about the persuasiveness of gay marriage canvassers may also have extended to the study’s funders. There is mounting evidence that the UCLA graduate student behind the cooked books may have also lied about funding for his research from several foundations that had not in fact sponsored his research. The biggest so far is a claimed $160,000 from the Jay and Rose Phillips Family Foundation of Minnesota that reportedly did not actually happen. [New York Magazine]

$656 million

The real money in the beekeeping business isn’t in the honey game — the U.S. bee market made $283 million from that in 2012 — it’s all about the pollination, where about 85 percent of the market is fertilizing almond groves. Beekeepers hauled in $656 million in 2012 renting out their hives to farms, orchards and groves. [Mother Jones]



2 billion






That’s how many videos are watched daily on Snapchat by 13 to 34 year olds, according to Snapchat, which has an interest in saying 2 billion videos are watched daily on Snapchat by 13 to 34 year olds. It also says 60 percent of smartphone users in that age group are active users of the service. [Bloomberg]

That’s how much money the international electronic music business made last year. It’s 12 percent higher than 2013 despite stagnation in sales of records and festival attendance. [Thump]

Former prime minister of Israel Ehud Olmert received a sentence of eight months in jail Monday after being convicted of fraud. It can be appealed. [The New York Times]


14 years
When commemorating Memorial Day on Monday, President Obama pointed out that it was, for the first time in 14 years, a celebration of the holiday while the U.S. was not involved in a ground war. To put it another way: there are freshmen in high school for whom this Memorial Day is different than any other. [Reuters]


22 schools
The public school system in Chicago completely forgot about 22 of its schools when building a hiring estimate for a janitorial contract. The oversight cost the district an additional $7 million annually on a contract that only cost $64 million in the first year. [Chicago Sun Times]

43-47 dolphins

The Maui dolphin is the smallest marine dolphin in the world, and the estimated population of the creature has dipped below 50. The dolphin is only found off the coast of New Zealand and could be extinct within 15 years. Only 10 of the 43 to 47 estimated dolphins are mature females, which appears to present a logistical problem for, you know, repopulating the species. [BBC]


60 percent of patients
That’s the upper bound of the percentage of patients who looked for a second opinion on a doctor’s diagnosis and received one that was a major change from what they had before. A Gallup Poll from five years ago, however, found 70 percent of Americans hadn’t seen the need for a second opinion. [Los Angeles Times]

 62 percent

Huge news out of Ireland, where citizens voted 62 percent to 38 percent to approve a referendum legalizing same-sex marriage. The nation — which only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993! — saw an even faster shift in public opinion than the U.S. did in the past 10 years. [FiveThirtyEight]

20,000

That’s about how many people are currently employed by Malaysia Airlines. The company is going to lay off about a third of those employees and restructure itself into a new company, hoping to shed the reputation of its two major air disasters that occurred within a five month period. [Reuters]

69.3 million euros


That’s how much the Vatican bank made in net income last year, about 24 times as much as the bank made the previous year when it was trying to clean up corruption inside the bank. [New York Times Dealbook] 



$200 million

That’s how much the company behind “dating service” Ashley Madison is looking to raise by going public. I put “dating service” in scare quotes there mostly because it is a site designed to facilitate affairs. If they pull off the fundraising round it would make Avid Life Media — the company that owns Ashley Madison — a billion dollar company. [BBC]



$55.1 billion





After a bid from Comcast earlier this year was spiked by the feds, Time Warner Cable is making a deal with Charter Communications, which will buy it for $55.1 billion. The acquisition would make Charter the second biggest cable company by subscribers, only topped by Comcast. [Bloomberg]

10 top candidates

According to The New York Times, there are 18-and-counting likely Republican presidential candidates. Not wanting, apparently, to turn the first presidential debate into a Rockettes tribute act, Fox News and CNN are limiting the participants to the top 10 candidates, determined by a national polling average. And not to bury the lede too deeply: CNN will also host an undercard debate featuring the not-top-10 who get at least 1 percent in the polls. Must-see TV. [FiveThirtyEight]

40,000 years
How long — 280,000 in dog years — dogs have been man’s best friend, according to a new analysis of an ancient Siberian wolf bone. This is, as if you didn’t already know, sometime during the Upper Paleolithic — the age of wall paintings of horses and people first inhabiting Japan. [The Telegraph]

$174,692 a week
The average weekly wage per player for French soccer team Paris Saint-Germain, the highest of any team in any sport. Eight of the top 10 are soccer clubs. This also beat out the Los Angeles Dodgers’ $154,292 and the New York Yankees’ $140,566. It was enough to win Paris Saint-Germain its third straight Ligue 1 title, thank goodness. [ESPN FC]

$350,000 hunting license
The amount a man paid to kill a black rhinoceros in Namibia. The man successfully killed the black rhino early this week. The man’s name is Corey Knowlton. The man is from Texas. There are fewer than 5,000 of the animals on the planet, but Knowlton claimed this particular rhino was a problem — it was too old to breed and killed other rhinos in fits of jealous rage. [Speaking of Science]


2.75 million dead

The number of Mitt Romney voters who will no longer be with us come the 2016 election. Similarly, according to an analysis of exit polls and Census mortality data, 2.3 million of President Obama’s voters will have died, giving Democrats a 453,000 “advantage.” Either that, or they’ll be haunted by 453,000 additional ghosts. [Politico Magazine]

3.3 million years old

If you thought dogs have been pets for a long time, hoo boy have I got a digit for you. We’ve been making tools for days! Some stone tools found in Kenya are 3.3 million years old — 700,000 years older than any previous find. The tools are sharp blades, but what exactly they were used for is unknown. [The New York Times]




5.3 million youths


Youth participation in baseball in 2013, down from 8.8 million in 2000. This also worries Major League Baseball. “The biggest predictor of fan avidity as an adult is whether you played the game,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. [The Wall Street Journal]


$2.4 billion a year


On paper, jails cost New York City $1.1 billion a year. But the true number is over double that — $2.4 billion according to a report from the Vera Institute of Justice. The “hidden” costs included “benefits for jail employees, medical care for inmates, and administrative services.” Some 12 million people are admitted to America’s jails each year. [BuzzFeed News]


3.5 billion views





The total views of the videos of Joseph Garrett — nom du jeu Stampy — a Minecraft celebrity on YouTube. This edges out even Lady Gaga for total views. So we’re clear: A YouTube Minecraft video is, essentially, a video of a stranger playing with digital Lego’s. [The New York Times]

13 trillion electron volts

The Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator is being cranked up to 11! Well, to 13 trillion actually. After generating evidence of the Higgs boson — and a couple of Nobel Prizes in the process — at half that energy, physicists at the LHC are now searching for dark matter. Is that not what happened to Doctor Manhattan? [CBS News]

17 women

The number of girlfriends who showed up at a man’s hospital bed in China after being contacted by doctors after he’d had an accident. The beaucoup belles had been theretofore unaware of each other’s existence. The man, identified only as “Mr. Yuan,” has been arrested for fraud related to money he took from the women. Some of the women were upset by the accident at first, “But when I started seeing more and more beautiful girls show up, I couldn’t cry any more,” said Xiao Li. [BBC]

27 tornadoes
The number spotted Tuesday through early Wednesday morning in Texas and Oklahoma. Two injuries and no deaths were reported. [The Weather Channel]

103 papers and videos
The number of documents released by the U.S. on Wednesday, obtained during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. The broader message of the documents is familiar: Kill Americans. But some show off the humdrum side of terrorist life, including “a fill-in-the-blanks job application for al-Qaida candidates that not only asks typical human resources questions about education and hobbies but also, ‘Do you wish to execute a suicide operation?'” Another document asks for martyrs’ emergency contact information. [AP]


$115
Ebola workers, Time magazine’s persons of the year, are not exactly well compensated. One hospital burial team in Sierra Leone was promised just $115 a week in “hazard pay.” For months, they did not receive it. For Sierra Leone, “It was a monumental challenge in a country with a cash economy, no digital human resources database, a dearth of accountants, and a history of corruption.” [Newsweek]


180 episodes

The number of shows about nothing you can binge on in a matter of weeks. Hulu has announced that all of “Seinfeld” will be available for streaming, for the first time, starting June 24. Festivus comes early this year. [Entertainment Weekly]


0.77 on a 5-point scale
The large shift toward support of same-sex marriage by voters visited by gay canvassers a month prior, according to a widely cited study by Ph.D. candidate Michael LaCour and political scientist Donald Green. The study was covered by many major media outlets and featured on “This American Life.” It was seen as a major finding — “an affirmation of the power of human contact to overcome disagreement.” The only trouble is … it’s all made up. Green has submitted a retraction to Science, the journal where the article was originally published, after learning that the underlying data was fallacious. LaCour had been offered a prestigious assistant professorship at Princeton, but has since removed any evidence of that fact from his website. [FiveThirtyEight]

1,500 miles





President Barack Obama, insect lover in chief, has revealed a plan to expand “pollinator habitat on rights-of-way.” In other words, the federal government will improve butterfly habitats along Interstate-35, which runs 1,500 miles from the Mexican border to Minnesota. That’s an important path in the Monarch butterfly’s migration. Obama has also proposed restoring 7 million acres of habitat friendly to the ever-struggling bee. [Quartz]

6,500 words

The number of newly playable words just added to the Scrabble dictionary. They include vape, onesie, pwn, lolz, shizzle, grr, yeesh and obvs. And emoji, obvs. These words are valid in the Scrabble lexicon called Collins, which is used in English-language play outside North America, and at World Championships. (The state of the North American dictionary, on the other hand, is a nightmare, lolz.) [Herald Scotland]

$187 million


The amount a Tennessee family bilked from ostensible cancer charities. In fact, the money was spent on “cars, gym memberships, cruise vacations, and college tuition.” For that money, I’m guessing they were the fittest, tannest, most educated family in Tennessee. The Federal Trade Commission has brought suit against James T. Reynolds Sr., his ex-wife and son. The money was solicited, $20 at a time, by telemarketers. [Fox News]


$5.6 billion



In yet more uplifting financial news, five banks will plead guilty and have agreed to pay nearly $6 billion for multiple crimes. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland will plead guilty to antitrust activities in foreign exchange markets. And UBS will plead guilty to manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, “a benchmark rate that underpins the cost of trillions of dollars in credit cards and other loans.” Seriously, enough already, people.

2.4 percent
This should come as a surprise to exactly no one: No one actually reads Thomas Piketty’s 696-page “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” Based on a study of annotations in Kindle ebooks, people tend to make it only 2.4 percent of the way through that tome. (I’ve got two copies of it sitting on my bookshelf and, uh, still plan to read it.) Piketty actually edges out Hillary Clinton, though — readers get just 2.04 percent through her “Hard Choices.” [The Fix]

4 inches
How much shorter boys who smoke marijuana before puberty are, according to a new study. So much for, ahem, getting high. (Sorry, I had to do it.) [The Telegraph]

$15 an hour

Los Angeles’s minimum wage … soon. The city council there voted 14-1 to raise the wage from $9 to $15 by the year 2020. If all goes according to plan, the first bump, to $10.50 an hour, will come next summer. [Los Angeles Times]

25 years

How long the human race has been wasting time playing the solitaire game on the Windows operating system. Also, approximately how long nosy passersby have been yelling at me to put that red 7 over there. No, over there! [PC Magazine]


60 percent

The share of Americans who support same-sex marriage — an all-time high according to Gallup. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the issue in June, and it may be that their decision dovetails with the ongoing shift in public opinion. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiated a same-sex wedding last weekend and, reportedly, emphasized the word “Constitution.” Many are reading the tea leaves as a positive sign for same-sex marriage proponents. [Gallup]


Over 70 kilograms


The amount of heroin federal authorities seized from a Bronx house over the weekend (in what sounds like a scene from a lost episode of “The Wire”), after a yearlong investigation. That’s roughly 154 pounds, or $50 million worth, of the drug. They also found $2 million in cash under the floorboards. [The New York Times]

6,028 shows
The length of David Letterman’s late-night tenure. The run — which began in 1982 with NBC’s “Late Night” — ends tonight, as he bids farewell to “Late Show” on CBS. [Variety]

40,150 minutes
Just about four weeks, or how long Hillary Clinton had gone without answering a question from the press. The streak was broken Tuesday with “five minutes of questions from various reporters following a group meeting in Iowa.” If she manages to maintain this pace until Election Day, she’ll only answer questions about 19 more times. Make ’em count, reporters. [The Fix]


$25 million




The former bounty for information leading to Osama bin Laden’s whereabouts, and the current figure for Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden’s successor as al-Qaida leader. Some, however, think these figures should be much higher. Economist Alex Tabarrok has written that the bounty on bin Laden should’ve been $500 million. “We could have avoided several wars at that price.” [The Atlantic]


33.8 million vehicles






The number of vehicles airbag manufacturer Takata said it would declare defective. The move affects 11 automakers, and is in response to airbag inflators which can lead to lethal explosions. It’s thought to be the biggest recall of any consumer product in U.S. history, eclipsing the recall of 31 million bottles of Tylenol in the early 1980s. Six deaths and over 100 injuries have been linked to the airbags. [The Detroit News]

2-to-3

The early odds on American Pharoah to win the Belmont Stakes and capture the first Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. But, as my colleague Ben Morris warned, one should be skeptical of the heavy favorite. It is entirely conceivable that, on June 6, one of the many other fast horses will run faster than that one fast horse. [International Business Times]


$15



The cost of a CD, obtained via a FOIA request, containing the internal communications of the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office while they were chasing two escaped llamas through Sun City, Arizona, in February. For my money, easily the best llama-related investment since the Inca Empire. [MuckRock]


65 Twitter accounts

Barack Obama — “dad, husband, and 44th President of the United States” — has joined Twitter. While his following exploded to over a million in an afternoon, he follows just 65 accounts. They’re the usual suspects: the First Lady, former presidents, his almae matres, Chicago’s professional sports teams. Er, except the Cubs. Mr. President, you’re hereby on bandwagon-watch come October. [Bloomberg]

$4,000



The cost of a doctoral degree from such prestigious schools as Columbiana and Barkley. [The New York Times]

11,000 calls

The number of calls to poison control centers in 2013 related to the consumption of laundry detergent pods. Don’t eat laundry detergent pods. While the pods have been decried as a poison hazard to children unlike any other, the 11,000 number was actually dwarfed by cases concerning acetaminophen, multivitamins, bleaches and diaper cream. Don’t eat diaper cream. [Wonkblog]


$750,000
The restaurant Chili’s investment in an “egg-wash spread” that is apparently meant to make its food more photogenic, and therefore photos of it more shareable on social media like Instagram. Please excuse me while I slather myself in egg-wash spread and take a selfie. [The Huffington Post]


1.2 million warrants


The number of open arrest warrants in New York City, a city with a population of about 8.4 million. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s criminal justice coordinator, Elizabeth Glazer, said in a statement that officials are looking into “how to safely reduce the number of already outstanding warrants in this city.” This reform would likely take the form of amnesty. [AP]




26 million birds

The Hawkeye State has a few other fowl to deal with, and is seeking help. After bird flu cases were reported in the state, Iowa has been turned down by Nebraska and South Dakota, which fear contamination if the dead birds — mountains of chickens, turkeys and ducks — are discarded in their landfills. [The Des Moines Register]

40 million pain pills
The average annual shipment of prescription painkillers into West Virginia by drug wholesalers between 2007 and 2012. During that time, “distributors shipped 59.9 million oxycodone pills and 140.6 million hydrocodone pills” to the state. West Virginia has a population of 1.85 million. Those two drugs are widely abused, and lead to more overdose deaths there than any other. [The Charleston Gazette]

$8 billion
The increase in Apple’s market value after billionaire Carl Icahn tweeted that he thought Apple stock was undervalued. Icahn’s own position in the company, through his Icahn Associates fund, increased in value by $76.5 million in a day. Boy I tell ya, I really need to get one of those hedge funds. [MarketWatch]

The number of wins Barcelona and the impossible Lionel Messi are away from completing a historic “treble” — same-year victories in a national league, a national cup and a continental competition. After clinching the La Liga title on Sunday, Barcelona will face Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final on May 30, and Juventus in the Champions League final on June 6. Only a handful of teams in history, including Barcelona in the 2008-9 season, has completed the feat. Here comes treble? [ESPN FC]


7 percent




The share of elite athletes with a heart abnormality, based on a study of 2,354 Italian Olympic hopefuls. You see, this is why I don’t work out. [The Times]


9

The number of people killed in a shootout between rival biker gangs Sunday in Waco, Texas. The tragedy began as a fist fight, and “quickly escalated,” involving hands, feet, chains, knives and guns. Eighteen people were taken to the hospital. [CNN]

11



The number of Republican presidential hopefuls who addressed potential supporters at the Iowa GOP’s Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines on Saturday. In roughly 258 days, fully grown Iowans will crowd elementary school gymnasia across the state in a bizarre local ritual known as a “caucus.” [The New York Times]

15 years

The average time that an inmate executed in 2013 had spent on death row. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death on Friday for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing, but he’s unlikely to be executed any time soon, according to my colleague Ben Casselman’s analysis. Tsarnaev’s sentence came in federal court. Between 1988 and 2013, 71 federal defendants were sentenced to death, but only three have been executed. [FiveThirtyEight]

1971
The year of the first lawful same-sex wedding in the United States — at least according to the two men who got married. Forty-four years later, as the Supreme Court considers whether to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, Jack Baker and Michael McConnell “are still happily married, and they love each other.” [The New York Times]


$2,800 a month
The official definition of “affordable” apartment rent for a family of four in New York City, according to a proposal by Mayor Bill de Blasio to extend tax breaks to certain landlords. New York I love you, but you’re freaking me out. If Walter Hickey were here, he’d probably tell me to move to Jersey City. [Capital New York]


4,296


The new record for most selfies taken simultaneously, set on Saturday. That many duck faces would strike fear into anyone’s heart, and I haven’t even told you that they were all Cardinals fans in Busch Stadium. The horror. [PR Newswire]




1 million air miles

The top prize offered by United Airlines to any “ethical hacker” who uncovers a major flaw in its security system. The bounty comes after a not-so-ethical hacker claimed to be able to control an airliner via the inflight entertainment system. No word yet on the prize for developing edible airline food, however. [NBC News]

$200 million
The potential payout to victims that Amtrak may face after last week’s derailment in Philadelphia. It’s the upper limit — the most Amtrak would possibly pay — set by Congress in 1997, in an effort to “rescue Amtrak from financial ruin.” The amount may not, however, be enough to cover the costs of the eight deaths and over 200 injuries suffered.

3.6 percent
After a report that showed many users of online dating applications may already be in relationships, mobile app Hinge did an internal review and found that 3.6 percent of profiles belonged to people who said they were married or in a relationship. “Sure,” a local lifestyle writer was heard assuring himself, “that’s why you’re not getting messages.” [Daily Dot]

13 percent
Annual growth rate of carbon emissions from powering data centers, according to Greenpeace. [Wired]


26 percent
Percentage of Americans who think the Iraq War was worth it. This may irk presumed GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who has been caught off guard with questions about how he would have handled the conflict. Let’s be real here: If your last name is “Bush,” you probably need to go into an election knowing people are going to bring up Iraq, just like if your last name is “Clinton” you know they’ll ask about the mighty sarlacc pit of your finances, or if your last name is “O’Malley” they’ll ask, “Who?” [FiveThirtyEight]

42.1 percent
Proportion of U.S. bee colonies that died off in the past year, according to a survey of beekeepers. That’s not great because we need bees to pollinate our food, produce honey, and tactfully aid in explaining sex with birds, or something. [Quartz]

A Hong Kong man was arrested in Sydney Thursday after being caught smuggling 150 kilograms of methamphetamine into Australia. [Australian Broadcasting Company]


179 pounds

Former U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney weighed in at 179 pounds Thursday ahead of a charity boxing match against Evander Holyfield. [MSNBC]


$75,000
ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos — who, full disclosure, also works for The Walt Disney Company, just like me — apologized for contributing $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation over three years and not disclosing the donations publicly. Stephanopoulos also pulled out of moderating any GOP presidential debates. [CNN Money]

More than 100,000 accounts

Upwards of 100,000 accounts suspected of automating gameplay on MMORPG World of Warcraft were banned, the company behind the game announced on Thursday. [PC Gamer]


$14 million
“The Simpsons” and Harry Shearer, who voices a number of characters on the show, were reportedly unable to ink a deal for a $14 million contract over two seasons. [CNN]

$49.3 million
That’s how much money Harvard University, a massive investment fund that is also known for providing education, paid six endowment managers last year. [Bloomberg]

A survey of partners at 320 law firms found that three in five reported overcapacity was cutting into profits. At this point, I’d bet that every single person involved in the legal industry has screamed as loudly as possible at people considering law as a profession to stop doing so. [Bloomberg]

The Amtrak train that derailed near Philadelphia on Tuesday was traveling more than double the speed limit around a curve when it went off the tracks. [The New York Times]

338-88

The House of Representatives voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act, but stripped out language that allowed the government to collect a database of bulk phone surveillance. The bill goes on to the Senate, where leaders have indicated they’re pretty OK with the whole indiscriminate dragnet thing. [Ars Technica]




900%

Kayem, a Mumbai pharmaceutical company, raised the price of the anesthetic sodium thiopental 900 percent when it found out South Dakota intended to use the drug for human executions. The drugs used in lethal injections are in short supply as many manufacturers step away from providing them for executions. [The Atlantic]



$750,000
Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company funneled three-quarters of a million dollars through nonprofits to pay for a visit from 10 members of U.S. Congress and their staffs. This wasn’t fully disclosed. Most importantly, one member who received a number of rugs said she did not disclose the gift because she “did not think they were particularly valuable,” according to The Washington Post. “She also thought that they were unattractive,” which I think should be a totally legal and legitimate reason to not disclose the value of a gift. [The Washington Post]

$12 million
Cost to eradicate rats from South Georgia Island over four years. The pests can be catastrophic for fauna on the island, which is located about a thousand miles from Antarctica. The attempt to kill all the rats, which ended in March, is considered the largest such mission in any place ever. [The Verge]

 $52 million
How much the British singer Sarah Brightman paid to have a Soyuz rocket fly her to the International Space Station. The performer has suspended the plans, but that’s a cool insight into how much it costs these days to get a lift out of Baikonur. [Yahoo]


$44 billion
While income tax returns stayed relatively flat, American taxpayers paid $44 billion more to the government during filing season this year. That may have actually made a dent in the economy in April, as consumers had a little less cash on hand. [Bloomberg]

1.7 percent fall
Verizon is going to buy AOL for $4.4 billion, but you probably knew that already. Not saying you should read into this all too much — daily stock moves are rarely significant digits — but Verizon stock did fall 1.7 percent yesterday on the news. AOL stock, on the other hand, jumped 18 percent in morning trading. [The Wall Street Journal]

2 times the national average

Research from Hershey’s found that Utahans consume candy at a rate almost twice the national average. How come? Three in five Utah residents are Mormons, a group for whom sweets is one allowed indulgence. Plus, the state skews young. [Bloomberg]


2.5 percent
That’s how much alcohol consumption is down overall in wealthy countries in the last 20 years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the OECD says there’s a newer “major public health and social concern” of binge drinking among young people. [Associated Press]

5 moons
NASA’s New Horizon probe is close enough to Pluto to snap images that capture each of the planet’s five known moons. Sure, Charon is the main object in Pluto’s life — and vice versa — but the four smaller moons Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra (I just checked, only “Nix” has not been taken by a band with sweet taste in names) are now somewhat in clear view. [NASA]

27 percent
A Department of Transportation report saw a 27 percent increase in complaints submitted by air travelers in March over February. One possible reason? It was the first time Spirit Airlines was included in the report. [WLRN]

40 percent 
Being a superhero is dangerous work: 40 percent of characters who were Avengers in the comic books died at least once. Don’t worry, most of them came back a-OK, because comic books are weird. [FiveThirtyEight]


46 percent

The percentage of New York City residents who think Bill de Blasio is distracted from his duties as mayor by his work in national affairs. De Blasio announced a progressive “contract with America” in D.C. on Tuesday, but I smelled urine on a subway platform during my morning commute, so please get with the program, Mayor, you have stuff to do. [Quinnipiac]


99 cents
Wal-Mart’s generic-brand bottled water could come from anywhere really — it’s tap water — but of course it comes from dry-as-hell California. The city of Sacramento charges 99 cents for every 748 gallons consumed by bottler DS Services of America, which supplies Great Value bottled water to the retailer, where it’s sold for 88 cents per gallon. So, you know, slight mark-up. [CBS Sacramento]

4 games
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell dropped the hammer on the New England Patriots Monday, punishing the team after a report determined it was more likely than not that members of the organization deliberately deflated footballs before key games. Quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for four games, and the team was fined $1 million and docked two draft picks. [ESPN]

All things must come to an end, and “American Idol” — which I learned yesterday is still on television — will end next year after competing its 15th season. The desiccated and hideous portrait hidden in the ageless Ryan Seacrest’s attic was unavailable for comment. [Bloomberg]


54 percent

A new study suggests that more than half of people who reported using drugs only on weekends would, within the next six months, eventually decide to innovate and start using drugs on other days of the week as well. Because when you think about it, the days of the week are really pretty arbitrary, man. [Los Angeles Times]


 $82,594
Hey, remember yesterday when we talked about all the taxpayer money New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is spending on lawyers? Well, here’s round two: An investigation found that Christie debited $82,594 in taxpayer funds to the concessions at Delaware North Sportservice, the guys who run the stadium where the Jets and Giants play.

That’s how many miles the director of Google’s self-driving car program said autonomous vehicles have travelled over the past six years of testing. [Medium]

53.5 million

We did it! Millennials are now a plurality of American workers, with 53.5 million people ages 18 to 34 in the workforce in 2015, compared to 52.7 million Gen Xers and 44.6 million baby boomers. I was born in the ’90s and I have a job — get used to it, boomers, my people are here to stay. [Pew Research Center]


$179,365,000
There’s a new record for sale price at auction for a work of art, with a Picasso selling for $179 million and change at Christie’s. [@ChristiesInc and NBC News]

$500 billion
So Dodd-Frank says that any bank with $50 billion in assets is under enhanced supervision from the government because it’s considered too big to fail — that covers 33 financial institutions. Sen. Richard Shelby, who’s now running the show at the Senate banking committee, is trying to raise the threshold to $500 billion, which would affect only six institutions. Realistically, that’s probably just an opening bid to strike a deal with banking committee Democrats. Either way, raising the floor would help banks just skirting underneath the $50 billion asset threshold expand. [The Wall Street Journal]

4 percent

That’s Alabama’s existing tax on rentals of “tangible personal property.”  The state’s department of revenue wants to extend that tax to rentals on, say, Netflix, which generally speaking is pretty intangible and impersonal. [The Washington Post]


5th-most productive

Willie Mays saw his career home run record eclipsed by beleaguered Yankee Alex Rodriguez last Thursday, but the stats still appear to show that Mays was the better ballplayer. Looking at all-time wins above replacement, Mays is in fifth place in the annals of baseball history, while A-Rod is 17th. [FiveThirtyEight]


11 percent
The new cigarette tax rate in China, up from 5 percent. About 1 million Chinese citizens die annually from smoking-related illnesses. The last time China raised the tax, the State Monopoly of Tobacco Administration — which owns the country’s cigarette manufacturer because, you know, communism — isolated actual smokers from the tax and just ate the costs. So let’s just wait and see how this goes. [Bloomberg]

At least 12 arrests
Please never change, Massachusetts: More than 100 people were involved in a brawl at Revere Beach in Massachusetts on Mother’s Day. There were at least 12 arrests after an altercation that began between two women and their friends spiraled into an all-out fight at the beach. [NECN]

60 kimberlite pipes
New research suggests that the plant Pandanus candelabrum can grow the presence of kimberlite pipes, or underground columns of volcanic rock. Who cares? Well, there are about 6,000 known kimberlite pipes, and a tenth of them have diamonds in them, and about a tenth of those have enough diamonds to be worth digging up. So keep your eyes peeled for Pandanus candelabrum. I don’t really know how this works but between you and me, this weekend I’m going to check to see if there might be diamonds under the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Shh! [CNET]

$86
Current projection for the fare to ride California’s future bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco. If you follow technology at all, you probably know by now that Californians are really bad at estimating the actual value of things — be it a train ticket or a startup — so it should come as no surprise that the estimate has been as low as $50 and as high as $105. [Los Angeles Times]

 $1.1 million to $2.3 million
That was the range of the value of former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke’s assets back when he was running America’s favorite helicopter-based cash-distribution entity. He’s probably a little bit further in the black now that he’s consulting for Pacific Investment Management Co. and the hedge fund Citadel. [Bloomberg]



$5.4 million
That’s how much the U.S. Department of Defense paid NFL teams to honor and thank the nation’s troops from 2011 to 2014. The funds mostly came from the National Guard. [NJ.com via Scout]

$11,118,775.13

As of Friday, that’s how much money has been spent by the state of New Jersey on legal bills for the parties involved in the “bridgegate” scandal. About $7.8 million went to foot the legal bills of members of the governor’s office. [WNYC’s Matt Katz]


$50 billion
Uber is considering raising another $1.5 billion in funding, which would value the company at $50 billion, basically making it a herd of unicorns if my Silicon Valley terminology is up to date. [The New York Times]

5 degree angle
The laughably porous White House fence is about to get a little more intimidating as the Secret Service plans to install sharp metal points extending outward at a five degree angle on the top of the fence. At the very least that will show the pigeons who’s boss. [Reuters]

$10 per day

The starting wage for some manicurists in New York City, according to a new New York Times expose. That is not a typo. [The New York Times]


56 seats

Two top stories out of the U.K. election: the Conservative party’s surprising dominance — as of this writing it’s within a seat of an outright majority, and is projected to attain it — and the rise of the Scottish National Party, which won 56 Parliamentary seats, up from 6 seats previously. [FiveThirtyEight]


150 percent

Hepatitis C infections increased 150 percent from 2010 to 2013, driven largely by people who used injected drugs. [BuzzFeed]


152 selfies

A Fusion analysis of 152 Instagrammed selfies taken by Kim Kardashian over the course of one year found that 21 percent were taken in a mirror, 12 percent were taken outdoors, and 8 percent were taken while the celebrity was in bed. You may scoff at this, but this is probably the use of numbers that the most Americans will care about all year. [Fusion]


186.4 miles per hour
“Guy goes fast on a thing in a place” records are not usually that interesting, but I’m willing to make an exception. Idris Elba — the guy from “The Wire” and “Thor” — broke the U.K. land speed record in a Bentley Continental GT Speed on a beach, maxing out at 186.4 miles per hour. [CNN Money]

$35,000
The biggest issue Tesla has had with getting normal people to buy their cars has been the price. But that may change. Founder and plausible Bond villain Elon Musk said in an earnings call that the company is planning on unveiling the Tesla Model 3 with a predicted price of $35,000 sometime next March. [Geek.com]


$800,000
LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD: Stephen Colbert announced that the sales of his old set would be put towards funding every single grant request from teachers at South Carolina public schools on DonorsChoose.org. The donation amounts to about $800,000 overall. [Greenville News]



10.9 million
FitBit, the fitness and sleep tracker company, sold 21 million devices since the company began operations in 2007. What’s more, almost half of those wearables — 10.9 million — were sold last year. The company is looking to have an IPO. [Re/Code]

$4.5 billion
That’s Nintendo’s sales last year, bolstered by the Amiibo interactive figurine. The biggest news out of the company, though, was a plan to team up with Universal Parks & Resorts to build Nintendo attractions in theme parks. Just FYI Nintendo, I would probably pay $500 for the experience of actually catching a Pokémon. [Wired]

4th season

On Thursday Fox announced the cancellation of “The Mindy Project,” but distraught fans were told nearly instantaneously that the show would be moving to Hulu. TV in 2015, where nothing can stay dead — especially a “Walking Dead” spinoff. [The Hollywood Reporter]


6.5-point favorite
Las Vegas sports books are scrambling to put a hold on New England Patriots bets after a report from the NFL said that the team probably under-inflated footballs to gain a competitive advantage. It’s currently unclear if there will be any punishment meted out to the team or quarterback Tom Brady, leading Vegas to freeze betting on New England’s first game, in which it was favored by 6.5 points against the Pittsburgh Steelers. [Bloomberg]

Zynga, the publicly traded two-hit wonder behind Farmville and Words With Friends, is laying off 18 percent of its workforce to cut $100 million in costs. [Mashable]

56 shots
Judges in France will decide whether to find a bar owner guilty of manslaughter in the death of a patron who consumed 56 shots in one night. The bar had a sign indicating a previous such record was 55 shots. The patron reportedly consumed 30 shooters in a minute. This is a good reminder that alcohol is technically poison. [The Local]

190 shops
The number of one-hour photo stores fell from 3,066 shops in 1998 to a mere 190 stores in 2013 nationwide. That makes RadioShack look like Apple and Blockbuster look like… well, still Blockbuster, actually. [Bloomberg]

1 in 285
A somewhat surprising finding out of Silicon Valley: despite being over-represented in tech employment overall, a new study found that Asian men and women were vastly underrepresented in executive leadership positions at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo. The gap is largest among women: while 1 in 87 white men at those firms is in management at an executive level, only 1 in 285 Asian women are. [San Jose Mercury News]

The average length of an investigation into a sexual assault at at a college or university that concluded in 2014 was 1,469 days, or more than four years. [FiveThirtyEight]

Total amount of fines handed out by the Federal Election Commission due to infractions during the 2014 election, a new low in fines since they began to be recorded in 2001. This is all despite increasing amounts of money flowing into politics. I doubt donors seeking to purchase influence from elected officials have suddenly become awesome at only doing legal things. [New York Times]


 £5 million 
That’s how much was wagered with London-based betting house Ladbrokes on the outcome of today’s U.K. election. One estimate has £100 million riding on the election in gambling alone. The U.K. sounds awesome. [FiveThirtyEight]

4 percent
Organizations that are hemorrhaging talent like to poke millennials with claims that they (ok, we) are incapable of staying at a workplace. But our flight is just a “young people” thing in general, regardless of generation. Every month 3 percent of working 22- to 29-year-olds change jobs. In the mid-1990s that rate was 4 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

16 states
New York is poised to become the 16th and largest state to have a standardized bar exam. The exam makes it easier for lawyers to pass the bar in more than one state. The size and litigiousness of New Yorkers could push other states to offer the standardized exam as well. [The New York Times]


34-5

The Kansas state senate voted 34-5 to override a gubernatorial veto of a bill that institutes background checks for ride-sharing drivers and cranks up the insurance they’d need. Uber has suspended operations in the state. [Mashable]

$1.1 billion


The EU is looking into union claims that McDonald’s dodged 1 billion euros — about $1.1 billion — in taxes through a loophole. As a guy who is secretly really into dubious international corporate tax maneuvering lingo, I was really, really hoping to make a “McDouble Irish” or “Dutch McChicken Sandwich” joke here but authorities say they may have routed profits through Luxembourg. To my knowledge a charming name has not yet been cooked up for that particular corporate tax avoidance strategy. If this turns out to be true I suggest we call it the “Quarter £-er with kachkéis” in McDonald’s honor. [The Guardian]




 $91 billion
That’s U.S. sales of sportswear apparel. Many people are just wearing sportswear like they’re real clothes. Sales are up 9.8 percent compared to last year and 27 percent compared to 2007. [The Wall Street Journal]

1 appearance
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has offered to appear one time and one time only before a congressional committee convened to investigate the attack in Benghazi, her lawyer said. I’m going to go out on a limb here and presume CSPAN will be charging $100 to watch the fight, $90 in standard definition, one side will have repeatedly voted against gay rights in Congress, many will tune in expecting an all-out brawl, but it will be mostly be defined by defense, leaving many disappointed in the state of the sport in general. [The New York Times]

Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina has entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. She is polling in last place nationally among candidates tracked by Huffington Post Pollster. But hey, at least she’s at 3 percent in New Hampshire! [FiveThirtyEight]

10.6 percent
One side effect of longer prison sentences required by mandatory minimum sentencing laws is that eventually those inmates are going to get old. Providing health care for the aging and infirm in America’s prisons is becoming a larger financial burden each year as the proportion of inmates older than 55 — 10.6 percent of the population in 2014, up from 6.4 percent in 2000 — rises. [Washington Post]

 40 percent of global trade
The Trans-Pacific Partnership — a free trade deal between 12 nations that comprise about 40 percent of global trade — is sizing up to be the biggest such deal since NAFTA. Despite the push for the deal from the president, the Democratic base is not really into the agreement. [FiveThirtyEight]

1 in 50
Drugs don’t always work. Indeed, many of the top selling medications in the U.S. work for few of the people actually consuming them. Statins prescribed to cut cholesterol may only work on as few as 1 in 50 people who take them. This has prompted policymakers to invest in “precision medicine,” in which drugs are designed to work with a particular profile. [Nature]

The Onion’s satirical empire is one of those unique media organizations that is able to boast profitability.

Japan plans to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by up to 26 percent in the next 14 years, using 2013 levels as a baseline. The U.S. — which generally sucks at this kind of thing, let’s be honest — has a target reduction of 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, so keep that in mind, I suppose.

16.5 mistakes per 100 words
Just when you thought Washington couldn’t be worse at anything than selecting quarterbacks, a proofreading company analyzed Internet comments to find out which NFL fan base had the worst spelling and grammar. Fans of the Detroit Lions were the best of the bunch, with only 4.2 spelling or grammar mistakes per 100 words, while fans of the Washington, D.C., area football team were the worst, with 16.5 errors per 100 words.

The streaming rights to the 180 episodes of the television show “Seinfeld” were sold to Hulu for an estimated $700,000 per episode.

40 bags per year

New restrictions approved by the European Parliament will drastically cut back on the consumption of plastic bags in member nations. The regulations require that either no new lightweight plastic bags — the flimsy kind you get at a grocery store, say — are distributed free of charge by 2018, or that nations limit consumption to 90 bags per citizen by the end of 2019 and 40 bags per citizen by the end of 2025.

120 resident offenders

When someone is a registered sex offender, there are lots of restrictions on where they can live. One side-effect of this is that new communities of offenders in particularly remote areas — such as one in Pahokee, Florida with 120 offenders in 61 bungalows — can crop up. [GQ]

7,990 square kilometers

China has eclipsed France as the nation with the second highest amount of space devoted to vineyards, behind only Spain.

3 percent
Share of federal spending this year going toward scientific research, down from nearly 10 percent in 1968, at the height of the space race. A group of MIT scientists said Monday that the decline is threatening innovation. Clearly the innovation-industrial complex has yet again found a way to jam itself into American politics, am I right? [Reuters]

Number of wins by NBA teams after falling behind by three games to none in the first round of this year’s playoffs.

44,828

First rule of not getting your car stolen: Do not leave your keys in your car. Having watched my share of action movies, I assumed people understood that leaving their keys above the visor was the best way to get their car lifted by a protagonist. Not the case! Thefts where the keys were left within the vehicle rose 14 percent in 2014 from two years earlier, to 44,828. [Bloomberg]

$41,797,550.16

How much one woman was told she won from a video penny slot machine in 2011. It was a glitch — she only won $1.85. The woman sued — and lost, because the machine’s maximum output is only supposed to be $10,000. The house always wins. [Ars Technica]

$1.08 billion

The Romance Writers of America’s estimate of how much the genre made in 2013. The genre is unique in the industry — fundamentally meritocratic (fans regularly become writers themselves) and a huge moneymaker for a beleaguered printing business. [Maclean’s]

5 ejections

Apparently not realizing that NHL teams were still playing, the Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox sought to appease North American sports fans’ desire for timid shoving and desecration of the “spirit of the game” (or some crap like that) by having a good old-fashioned bench-clearing brawl. [NBC Sports]



$20.26

Good news: A deal between Chipotle Mexican Grill and the Postmates delivery service mean that, yeah, you can now finally get a Chipotle burrito delivered. Bad news: When a reporter guinea pigged the process, he found that his $8.27 wrap would end up costing $20.26 with delivery and service fees. The future is oh so close, friends, but most of us won’t be able to afford it. [Re/code]

70 times greater


The seismicity rate in Oklahoma was 70 times greater in 2013 than the background rate before 2008, state officials said.

The group was paid to send six erotic dancers to perform at a funeral service, a popular party theme for laying lost loved ones to rest in areas where a well-attended funeral means good fortune in whatever comes next. The shows cost $322 each. [The Wall Street Journal]

$75,000

The University of Alabama at Birmingham announced last year it planned to shutter its football program, along with rifle and bowling, due to financial difficulties.

Fwd.us, the techie nonprofit organization lobbying for increasing immigration of highly educated people into the U.S., raised about $37 million in its first year of operation.

The amount Floyd Mayweather paid a dentist for about 20 custom mouthguards. Mayweather will fight Manny Pacquaio next week in Las Vegas. [Grantland]


100,000

One well-known biohacker’s estimate for the number of biohackers worldwide. Biohackers seek to take control of and improve their biochemistry, their bodies and their minds, according to this well-known biohacker’s website. His estimate should be taken with a grain of salt — or pat of butter, as he takes his coffee — since he’s trying to make a bunch of money selling supplements to biohackers. But he also came up with “bulletproof coffee,” so he’s all right in my book. One night in college I tried to use a dumb party game that shocks you in order to stay awake studying, and while that was an awful idea that completely failed, that night was also when I decided to count myself in the noble club of biohackers. [Bloomberg]

15 billion years
Throw out your Apple Watches; they can’t compete with strontium. Scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado, Boulder, have built an atomic clock that uses the alkaline earth metal strontium to keep time. It’s so precise, it won’t gain or lose a second for 15 billion years. Shame they came out with it a year after we realized that time is just a construct — a flat circle, really. [Los Angeles Times]


$22.98 trillion

That’s an economist’s estimate for the worth of the 1.89 billion acres of land in the continental United States. [The Wall Street Journal]

$25,000

How much veteran referee Kenny Bayless will be compensated to officiate the upcoming fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather.

9 batters. Or 10 batters. I say 9.

How many batters must go to the plate in a half-inning before it can be said a baseball team has “batted around?” That’s an extremely divisive question, even among the pros. John Mayberry Jr. of the Mets, Josh Satin of the AAA Louisville Bats and others — including me —  say the answer is nine. David Wright of the Mets, LaTroy Hawkins of Colorado and other mistaken people say 10. This is the kind of stupid divisive thing that starts wars, people. All I’ll say is that there’s a reason that π isn’t equal to (10*π)/9. Also, it’s pronounced “jif.” [The Wall Street Journal via @IvanTheK]

32 percent

Proportion of New Jerseyans who said they thought Gov. Chris Christie personally ordered the 2013 traffic jam at the entrance to the George Washington Bridge, according to a new poll. [Quinnipiac University Poll]

77

Cincinnati Reds manager Bryan Price let out a tirade directed at the media that would have made Rahm Emanuel blush. Price deftly used the word “fuck” 77 times in a menagerie of forms, while also sprinkling in 11 “shit” derivatives, all in service of his complaint that in-depth, accurate local coverage of the Reds organization has given an advantage to the competition. [Cincinnati Enquirer]


20,000 readers

Chevrolet bought video ads embedded in physical copies of Esquire and Popular Mechanics magazine. You read that correctly: There’s a video player inside the magazine pages. The specialized copies promote the Chevy Colorado, and were sent to 10,000 subscribers of each magazine whom Chevrolet had determined are likely consumers of the midsize pickup truck. Assuming this crazy experiment goes well, coverage of this form of advertising is going to go pretty quickly from the breathless tone you’re reading now to frustration with autoplaying videos embedded in comic books. [Advertising Age]

$2.3 million
The 2012 presidential campaign of President Barack Obama still owes about $2.3 million in debts. POTUS isn’t alone in this; the 2012 presidential campaign of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich owes more than $4.6 million to creditors. [Center for Public Integrity]


2,713,570 killed animals
Each year the Department of Agriculture discloses details about every single animal it killed. In fiscal year 2014, the department killed more than 2.7 million animals. They were mostly European Starlings and other birds, but the kill list included members of 319 species, or roughly a Teddy Roosevelt‘s worth, if you don’t mind the technical term. [Mother Jones]

41.8 million metric tons
Anything with a battery or power cord — like, you know, basically everything in my apartment — is, once it’s tossed, considered electronic waste. There’s a whole lot of it. Last year the planet generated 41.8 billion kilograms of e-waste, only 6.5 billion of which was recycled. [Motherboard]

$469 million

Amount users of the accommodation-booking app Airbnb contributed to the San Francisco economy in 2014, according to a new study commissioned by the accommodation-booking app Airbnb. So take it with a grain of salt is all I’m saying. [Airbnb]



$6 billion

For several weeks in 2013, Elon Musk was negotiating a potential sale of his then-struggling automaker Tesla Motors to Google. Musk’s proposed terms for the deal were that Google would pay about $6 billion, with a further $5 billion promised for factory expansions. The deal didn’t go down, but an excerpt from a forthcoming book looks back at what could have been one of the biggest tech stories of the past several years. [Bloomberg]

The probability before the NBA playoffs began that the Golden State Warriors would win the title, based on player ratings provided to FiveThirtyEight by Jeremias Engelmann and Steve Ilardi.

More than 95 percent

The federal government — along with the Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers — is reviewing past testimony of examiners from the FBI’s microscopic hair comparison unit.

Price set by auction house Bonham for each of a set of pens and pencils that traveled on the Apollo 12 mission in 1969. One of the pens originally cost the U.S. government 30 cents, but hitching a ride with Alan Bean to the moon augmented its value. [Motherboard]

$400,000

Upper end of range of estimated price for an SUV that Rolls-Royce expects to start selling in 2018. High-end luxury SUVs — which companies including Mercedes-Benz and Bentley sell for more than $200,000 each — are in a relatively new auto class that appears to have staying power. [Bloomberg]

74 “lost” seasons

When a player leaves college early to join the NBA — as seven members of the University of Kentucky basketball team elected to do earlier this year — the school loses a year of production (that’s how the colleges see it, at least). Indeed, Kentucky has “lost” more seasons than any other Division I basketball program from players going pro, with 74 player-seasons “lost” since 1999. [ACC Sports]

Next stop: Pluto. [io9]

Croatia is seeing a bump in tourism, perhaps thanks to HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” which films its King’s Landing scenes there.

30 million pairs of Crocs

6, 7, 8 or 9
College basketball players are not allowed to wear the numerals 6, 7, 8 or 9 on their jersey. That leaves a crunch for uniform numbers, since 40 percent of numbers less than 60 aren’t allowed, and every number 60 and above might as well not exist. [The New York Times]

Viewership of MSNBC was down 20 percent from the first quarter of last year. The 9 to 11 a.m. hours had the worst ratings since 1999. [AdWeek]

Now if you’ll excuse me, have to go eat some frosted corn flakes now. They just changed the frosting recipe. Two times the corn syrup, same great taste! [Bloomberg Business]

35th place
It’s tax time, the magical time of year when some Americans owe Uncle Sam money, and some lucky others get their interest-free loan to the government returned to them. U.S. income tax rates are, for most Americans, low relative to what people in other countries are taxed.

$50,000 to $500,000
How much the company HolacracyOne charges companies to serve as consultants as they switch to Holacracy, a management system where, er, you get rid of management.

235,000 ripped-off, minority borrowers

The Justice Department is investigating companies that allegedly targeted minority borrowers with the costliest car loans they offered.

$350,000

The Atlanta Falcons were hit with a $350,000 fine and stripped of a 2016 fifth-round draft pick after it was discovered the team was pumping fake crowd noise into the Georgia Dome over the past two years. When asked why it did it, the franchise insisted it has fans but that they had totally met back at summer camp, that the fans were super hot but, like, lived across the country so you’ll probably never get the chance to meet them; but believe them, the Atlanta Falcons assured those present, the fans are just so into them. At press time, the Atlanta Falcons were offering to show reporters text messages they had received from their fans to prove they totally existed. [ESPN]

$2 million
That’s the total amount of contributions from the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee to about 100 representatives and senators over the past decade. One reason it’s difficult for schools to oversee and rein in fraternities is that the groups are very entrenched in politics and existing power structures. [Chronicle of Higher Education] 

2.8 million barrels
Daily oil output of Iran, down substantially from its peak production in 1974. As relations between the U.S. and Iran approach a thaw — or, I don’t know, a slight defrost, kind of hard to consider what’s going on a thaw — energy companies are salivating at the prospect of drilling there, despite the need for steep investments to get production where it could be.

A Government Accountability Office study found that 14 percent of reports didn’t disclose one or more formerly held positions. [GAO, via Brian Fung]


15 paid days off
Tech giant Microsoft is requiring many of its contractors and vendors to provide 15 paid days off to their employees who do work for Microsoft. It is unclear if this applies to Clippy, who has been on administrative leave for more than a decade. [The Upshot]


17 working drones
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a fleet of 17 unmanned aircraft but only two people capable of flying them. [The Verge]

60 percent to 70 percent

60,000 feet

Mark Zuckerberg announced a successful test flight of an unmanned aircraft designed to expand Internet access on the ground. According to the billionaire Facebook founder, the final design will be “able to stay at altitudes of more than 60,000 feet for months at a time.” Perhaps Facebook can lend the FBI a hand? [Facebook]
Wait, scratch that — that sounds like a terrible collaboration.

$40 million
American Apparel founder Dov Charney was fired from his position as CEO last year after being accused of sexual harassment and misuse of funds. He is now seeking $40 million in damages from the V-Neck T-Shirt empire. It’s unclear if he wants the $40 million to be delivered in bills derived from 100 percent fine-gauge, preshrunk combed cotton with a lightweight yet extra soft hand feel and printed in a sweatshop-free environment, yet I can only assume.

5-yard penalty

The NFL has approved a New England Patriots-inspired penalty that makes it illegal for an ineligible player wearing an eligible number to line up outside the tackle box. Still, not a lot of comfort for fans of the Baltimore Ravens, who lost a playoff game in which the Patriots used the formation. [ESPN]


17.6 percent down
As Russia’s economic crisis continues, alcohol sales are taking a hit: Vodka sales were down 17.6 percent by volume year-over-year in January, and beer sales were down 10.5 percent. Demand isn’t thought to be decreasing, however: People unable to afford those beverages are reportedly drinking more moonshine, medical alcohol and cleaning products. [Associated Press]

32 indictments

Marijuana is legal in Colorado. Marijuana is not legal in most other states. As a result, it’s not legal to grow pot in Colorado and then ship it other places. But this might seem like a good idea! It was probably the first idea a lot of us had when we heard about legal marijuana. It’s not a good idea! Colorado has indicted 32 people who are accused of having such an idea — and a multimillion-dollar business plan to go with it. [Denver Post]

174,000 years ago
An Icelandic study estimated that the most recent common male ancestor for all of humanity lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. I’m not so sure about that, but then again, my only frame of reference is the reimagined “Battlestar Galactica” television series. [The Verge]

That’s the enrollment figure at the for-profit University of Phoenix, down from about 460,000 five years ago. [CNN Money]

The number of people Facebook reports use its Messenger app monthly. The company — like many before it — sees its messaging service as an alternative to email. Email was unavailable for comment yet presumably remains both vestigial and immortal. [Medium]

More than 4 percent

SeaWorld, accused in a 2013 documentary of mistreating the orcas it owns, saw its attendance fall more than 4 percent for the second year in a row. The company launched a campaign to assure people that, nah, the whales are like totally cool with the whole captivity thing. [Fusion]


$10 fine
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination during Liberty University’s convocation, an event that students are required to attend.

Just three games into the NCAA men’s tournament on Thursday, only 0.7 percent of the 11.57 million brackets submitted to ESPN remained perfect. That only got worse as the night went on. [ESPN]

50 years
As of Thursday, that’s how long it’s been since the first time a person managed to float in space outside of a box designed to keep someone alive in space. On Mar. 18, 1965, cosmonaut Alexey Leonov went on the first spacewalk. [io9]

559 jokes
An analysis of Federal Reserve open-market committee transcripts looked at how often the board was reduced to laughter in each transcript. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan landed 559 jokes during his long tenure, the most of any Fed leader. [The Atlantic]

100,000 convictions
A batch of racially insensitive — to understate this a bit — text messages from five San Francisco police officers were released last week. As a result, about 100,000 convictions are being reviewed for bias. [Gawker]

$3 million
That’s the FBI reward for information about Russian cybercriminal Evgeniy Bogachev. It’s the first time the feds have put out a bounty on a hacker. Guys, at some point we need to really reconsider using the word “cyber.” It’s getting antiquated. [Associated Press]

$194 million
The NCAA makes a bunch of money from March Madness. It gives a portion of that money — $194 million last year — to the conferences that send teams to the tournament based on how well the teams do there. But the NCAA has a somewhat convoluted way of allocating all that cash. [Bloomberg Business]

$921,600

$1 million
Former Rep. Anthony Weiner left an interesting nugget in an article he wrote about the downfall of Rep. Aaron Schock: During Weiner’s own scandal, ethics lawyers told him he’d need to find $1 million in order to defend himself. Scandals can be really expensive, even before the other shoe drops. [Business Insider]

10 million units
The number of Wii U’s sold since 2012. That’s really low — the Wii sold ten times that from 2006 to 2014. In need of a win, Nintendo has announced they’re going to begin developing games for mobile platforms. [TIME]

$6.97 billion
The amount of recorded music sold last year, down from $14.6 billion in 1999. Revenue from streaming services amounted to $1.87 billion, which is more than the $1.85 billion derived from CD sales — the first time streaming has beaten CDs. [New York Times]

15 percent drop
Weight Watcher’s shares dropped more than 30 percent after the company’s earnings came out Tuesday. According to the weight-loss company, membership decreased by 15 percent in the final quarter of last year. Analysts think Weight Watchers may be bleeding members to free alternatives to its subscription service. [Business Insider]

24 to 36 hours
The sun is exploding. That isn’t exactly news — that’s what the sun is doing all the time — but it’s been exploding provocatively  since 10 a.m. Tuesday, producing a severe geomagnetic storm. This can affect electronics and GPS equipment, so consider trusting Apple Maps less than usual until this all ends (it’s expected to end sometime Wednesday). [Mashable]

165 mph winds
We’re finally getting data about the monster cyclone that hit the small island nation of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. At peak strength, the cyclone had winds of 165 miles per hour, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. Port Vila, the nation’s capital, was devastated by the storm. [Weather Channel]

340 percent rate of return
Karen Rubin analyzed the performance of Fortune 1000 companies from 2002 to 2014. Rubin found that when a female CEO was at the helm companies generated a 340 percent return for investors, compared to a 112 percent return for the S&P 500 benchmark. [Quartz]

32,000 awesome people whose day was ruined by a Nordic furniture store
Ikea said they will not allow people to play hide-and-seek in their stores in the Netherlands. Ikea’s decision came after a Facebook event for a game where 32,000 people signed up. This is a bummer, because the ASKVOLL bed frame really makes a perfect hiding spot (in addition to a nice bedroom accent). [NPR]

170,000 miles
Rep. Aaron Schock, Republican of Illinois, announced his intention to resign Tuesday after POLITICO reported that the congressman had billed the government for mileage he did not drive, potentially reaping tens of thousands of dollars in the process. The representative billed taxpayers for 170,000 miles on his car, which only had about 80,000 miles on the odometer when it was sold last summer. [POLITICO]

$8 million
The Secret Service wants $8 million to build a replica of the White House for training purposes. The Secret Service, an organization tasked with protecting the president, fighting counterfeiting and — presumably — not soliciting prostitutes abroad, has not had a great run of it lately.

Companies are looking to improve employee retention by using data to figure out who is eyeing the exit.

[Wall Street Journal]

$837,000 office pool
A NFL “survivor” pool of epic proportions led the police to raid a New Jersey man’s home. The pool, run by John Bovery, was worth $837,000 in 2009, Bovery said. It had nearly 4,000 participants. [NJ.com]

We’re not super sure what’s up with Russian President Vladimir Putin lately. He hasn’t been seen in public, which has caused a lot of speculation about what Russia would be like without him.

How long a volcano needs to chill out before being described as “dormant.” The distinction between an “active,” “dormant” and “extinct” volcano is actually somewhat nuanced. Extinct volcanos are cut off from a magma supply, active volcanos are, well, active, and dormant volcanoes haven’t erupted for at least 10,000 years (but with scientists believing it will erupt again).

When Netflix scored the digital distribution rights for “Friends,” they paid more than $500,000 per episode.

While Netflix has tapped out of the negotiations, Amazon, Yahoo and Hulu are reportedly still in. [Wall Street Journal]

For the gaudiest version of its new watch, Apple is using 18-karat gold, which must be three-quarters gold by mass. Apple has patented a way to maintain the 18-karat mass ratio while greatly reducing the volume of gold required by developing a new formulation using low-density ceramics. As a result, Apple gold products can be 75 percent gold by mass, but as little as 28 percent gold by volume. [Slate]

London’s Bedlam burial ground — used from 1569 until at least 1738 — was uncovered during construction of a new train line. Archeologists are excavating about 3,000 skeletons, which is — by my extensive calculations — roughly the number of skeletons in a room containing 3,000 people. [CNN]

 10,000 copies of “The Interview”
South Korean activists plan to drop up to 10,000 copies of the 2014 film “The Interview” into North Korea by balloon. In the comedy, James Franco and Seth Rogen try to kill North Korea supreme leader Kim Jong-Un, so his government is not exactly taking the airdrop plan well. [New York]

Amount Robin Thicke and Pharrell owe the estate of Marvin Gaye due to similarities between their song “Blurred Lines” and Gaye’s song “Got to Give It Up.” As we all know, no musician ever before had influenced any other musician in history, which made this case unprecedented. [Variety]

$14 million
Cost for the state of Louisiana since 1999 to prosecute and defend five men for the murder of a correctional officer. Death-penalty trials can be very, very expensive. [The Marshall Project]

$2 billion
How much Condé Nast, one of the first tenants of New York’s 1 World Trade Center, will pay to occupy the 20th through 41st floors for the duration of the magazine publisher’s 25-year lease. [The New York Times]

2 lethal injections
Here’s a sentence I never expected to write: Texas is almost out of lethal-injection drugs and is desperately trying to find someone to sell it more. The state only has enough for two more state-sanctioned killings, yet has seven scheduled through May 12. [Houston Chronicle]

9 percent
Percentage of American adults who never have sent an email. Presumably they’re all on Snapchat. [FiveThirtyEight]

29 percent
A modest plurality of Americans surveyed by Quinnipiac University said they trusted Fox News the most among network- and cable-news channels. [Politico]

32 percent
About one in three Americans own a firearm or live with someone who does. That, oddly enough, ties for the lowest level in the history of the General Social Survey, which started in the ’70s. [AP]

43 percent
According to the National Association of Realtors — which has an obvious interest in housing sales that has to be acknowledged — only 9 percent of buyers found their home at an open house, down from 16 percent in 2004. As in all things, the internet ruined it: 43 percent of buyers looked online first. Open houses, one realtor suggested, are really just opportunities to recruit clients. [Realtor.com]

72-61
The College of William & Mary, one of only 5 original Division I teams that never have made the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, had its dreams of a bid ruthlessly shredded Monday night when it lost to Northeastern University in the Colonial Athletic Association championship game. Northeastern will go on to March Madness. William & Mary will go on to Paul’s Deli to drink away the loss. This presumably will be the last mention of the school on an ESPN-affiliated website until a similar heartbreak about this time next year. Every effing year. Damn. [ESPN]

189.5 seconds
How long a McDonald’s drive-through order takes today, up from 152 seconds a decade ago, according to an analyst. Those extra 37.5 seconds — due in part to a more-complicated menu — can severely impact sales. [The New York Times]

$17,000
Cost of the most expensive iteration of the Apple Watch, made of gold. Several features of the watch were announced Monday, including Uber integration, 18-hour battery life, and, implicitly, the user’s right to be first against the wall when the revolution comes. [Re/code]


200,000 square feet
Malls, the desiccated temples of a dead consumerist god, have found second lives as companies sell once-fecund retail space to buyers ranging from doctors’ offices to city governments. Austin Community College converted a former JC Penney into 200,000 square feet of instructional space. [The Atlantic]

$300,000 to $600,000
Former Yankee Reggie Jackson will auction the letters that spelled “Yankee Stadium” on the former home of the New York Yankees for an expected total haul of between $300,000 and $600,000. No word on whether Sotheby’s is following the commonly accepted “Wheel of Fortune” rule by charging only for the six vowels. [The New York Times]

1 percent increase
Daylight saving time is not the energy saver it’s intended to be. According to one Indiana study, it results in a 1 percent increase in residential electricity use. This is further evidence, if we needed it, of the futility of humanity attempting to manipulate time itself. [Quartz]

2.2 miles
The length of a troubled streetcar line in Washington, D.C. The city has invested $200 million in a system eventually projected to cost $3 billion, but it has missed several targeted opening dates and might be scuttled. [The Washington Post]

4 inches
Fairbanks, Alaska, finally got some fresh snow a day before the Iditarod dogsled race was due to start. The annual race had to be moved north because snow levels were insufficient along the planned route. [AP]

6.1 percent
Percentage of Albanians who sought an American green card in 2013 through a U.S. State Department immigration lottery called the Diversity Visa Program. [Dadaviz]

30 percent of beaches
In Florida, sea-level rise from climate change threatens 3 in 10 beaches by the year 2100. Meanwhile, the state government banned Department of Environmental Protection employees from using the phrases “climate change” or “global warming ” in official communications. [Miami Herald]

32 percent chance
After finishing its regular season undefeated, the University of Kentucky men’s basketball team has roughly a one-in-three chance of finishing 40-0, based on probabilities calculated before Saturday’s regular-season finale. [FiveThirtyEight]

$180
Two New York City auxiliary police officers were arrested after allegedly ripping off a delivery man of his wallet, his phone and $180 in cash. Courtesy, professionalism, respect. [The New York Times]

227-page report
The International Cycling Union dropped a report about how doping was tolerated for years in cycling, blaming Lance Armstrong. Whatever, right? Here’s the crazy part: In order to smuggle blood into France — without trying to sneak blood bags past border police — one rider was given “two to three units of blood in Madrid and he would then travel to France, where the units would be removed immediately, to be used later throughout the Tour.” The hell? [The New York Times]

9,000 recipes
IBM supercomputer Watson is taking a stab at cooking, factoring in 9,000 recipes from Bon Appétit to understand what kinds of food go well with one another, like black pepper with saffron, paprika with carrot, or boxed macaroni and cheese with all the remaining booze in my house. [Kernel Mag]

$337,209,000
“American Sniper” surpassed “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” as the top-grossing film of 2014 this past weekend. Local lifestyle writers were heard to say that the latter film “totally had it coming because of that stupid title.” [Box Office Mojo]

27 percent
In a survey for Match.com — a site which kind of has some skin in the game — 27 percent of respondents said that one of their one-night stands had blossomed into a long-term committed relationship. [Nautilus]

36 kilowatts
The military has a death ray. Other people will call it a “prototype high-energy asset,” but Lockheed Martin made a thing that can blast 30 kilowatts of energy into a car with lasers and where I come from, that’s what you call a death ray. [Vice Motherboard]

51 covers
A member of the Bush family has now been on the cover of Time magazine 51 times. This week it’s Jeb’s turn. It’s worth going through each of the covers, since many of them are darkly funny in retrospect. [Time via Zeke Miller]

103 train cars
A train transporting 103 cars worth of crude oil caught fire in rural Illinois and forced the evacuation of everyone within a mile radius. [Associated Press]

3,000 feet
Harrison Ford — who is apparently an accomplished pilot? — crash-landed his vintage plane on a golf course on Thursday, smoothly taking the World War II-era aircraft down 3,000 feet, gracefully hitting only one tree, and landing on the fairway. The national treasure was a little beaten up but otherwise fine. [Associated Press]

3,500 labor hours
Amount of work that went into assembling Katy Perry’s Super Bowl halftime show lion. [Sports Illustrated]

46,000 tweeters
At least 46,000 Twitter accounts supported the Islamic State on the social messaging service from September to December last year. [The Washington Post]

$2.12 million
Better ingredients, better pizza — loads of wage theft. A New York City Papa John’s franchisee was ordered to pay $2.12 million over hundreds of wage-theft violations involving delivery drivers. [Gothamist]

$40 million
That stupid mobile game with the Kate Upton ads spent $40 million on the four-month campaign. It seems to have paid off: The makers of “Game of War” say they’re pulling in $1 million per day. [Bloomberg Business]

$100 million
Lincoln Center’s Avery Fisher Hall, where the New York Philharmonic plays, will be renamed after David Geffen following a $100 million donation from the entertainment executive. [The New York Post]

11 companies
Paying taxes is just a thing you have to do, really. Unless you’re one of the 11 profitable companies on the S&P 500 that didn’t pay any income tax in 2014. Two of them are Darden Restaurants and Goodyear Tire & Rubber. [USA Today]

54 percent
There’s a movement to cut the U.S. prison population in half by reducing sentences and changing parole rules. The minor issue here? Fifty-four percent of inmates in state prisons are in for violent crimes. It’s not too hard to persuade someone that some nonviolent drug offenders could get cut loose early, but violent offenders? That’s kind of a tough sell for “Cut50” advocates. [The Marshall Project]

60 percent of deaths
In New York City, 15 percent of streets account for 60 percent of pedestrian deaths. [Associated Press]

62 percent of BuzzFeed
BuzzFeed gets 62 percent of the images in its posts from just 25 online sources. Tumblr came out on top, followed by Instagram. [Priceonomics]

3,511 feet cubed
How big would a single building need to be to cram all of humanity — some 7.3 billion people — inside it? About 1.07 kilometers cubed, or 3,511 feet cubed. It’d take up basically all of NoHo and be 29 percent taller than the Burj Khalifa. [Wait But Why]

$50,000
John Sylvan, the inventor of the K-Cup coffee system, sold his stake in Keurig Green Mountain for $50,000 in 1997. The coffee pod company now makes $4.7 billion in revenue, and Sylvan says he now regrets ever inventing the K-Cup in the first place because the system is so wasteful. [The Atlantic]

3.3 million viewers
Fox News averaged the most viewers of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday. Second place went to CNN, which held an average of slightly more than 1 million viewers. The really interesting number here? A mere 558,000 of Fox News’ viewers were ages 25 to 54, and for some reason I’m doubting the rest of them were teens who love the news network. [TV By The Numbers]

$16.6 million
Remember “Blurred Lines”? Man that song sucked. There’s a big lawsuit over it, and now we’ve learned that it made $16.6 million. [The Wrap]

$1.93 billion
Etsy — an e-commerce site that allows individual (typically twee) producers to sell their (often artisanal) wares — is filing for an initial public offering. Sales last year through the site grossed 1.93 billion handcrafted, locally sourced and responsibly grown dollars. [Mashable]

2 probes
Thanks to a DARPA research project, a paralyzed woman was able to control a simulated F-35 fighter jet through two probes connected to her brain. [The Washington Post]

9.9 percent
Per capita share of spending on food in 2013, down from 17.5 percent in 1960. [NPR]

21 “Navajo-inspired” objects
Stores that cater explicitly to a hipster sensibility are suffering a decline, in part because you can now get most of their styles at Wal-Mart. So they’re trying to hold onto their market by being edgy with often unfortunate results — see American Apparel’s desperately sexualized advertising, or Urban Outfitter’s 21 unique “Navajo-inspired” items for sale. The latter prompted a cease-and-desist letter from the Navajo Nation. [Racked]

88 percent
In Ferguson, Missouri, 88 percent of documented incidents of police use of force between 2012 and 2014 were against African-Americans, according to a report from the Justice Department. [The New York Times]

100 people
Approximate number of people who knew former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal email address. The presumed 2016 Democratic frontrunner is taking heat for not using her federal government email account when she worked at the State Department. In fairness, nothing really says “vestigial form of communication” quite like “federal government email account.” [Associated Press]

271 paintings
Nine people were arrested in Spain after allegedly participating in a forgery ring that produced faux Picassos and more. Some 271 frauds were seized, but the sad clown painting I found in a thrift store is still legit as far as I can tell. [Artnet]

700 koalas
Stop reading this and skip to the next one. Australia killed 700 koalas to deal with overpopulation issues. I’m so sorry. I really didn’t want to be the one who broke this to you. But Elon Musk didn’t give any absurd valuation prediction this week so I am short on news. Are you happy, Elon Musk? You could have stopped this just by saying something ludicrous about the hyperloop. I will never not write about Elon Musk saying something ludicrous about the hyperloop. [Australian Broadcasting Company]

$450,000
The owner of a revenge-porn website — where intimate photographs were posted without consent and their subjects extorted for money in order to secure their removal — was ordered to pay $450,000 to a plaintiff who is a minor. [Ars Technica]

$1.5 million
Sum of political donations from the Pizza Industrial Complex in the 2012 and 2014 election cycles. The vast majority went to the GOP. Let’s be real, this strategy seems off: If Big Pizza really wants to position itself for growth it’ll start throwing big bucks behind marijuana legalization. [Bloomberg Business]

$94 million
Sweet Briar College, a women’s liberal arts school in Virginia, will stop instruction at the end of the semester due to financial difficulties. It will use the remainder of its $94 million endowment to ease the transition process, getting employees severance and remaining technically open so enrolled students can complete their degrees with credit from other colleges.

1 in 10
The proportion of biology Ph.D.s who will get a job in academia. The demand for people with doctorates just doesn’t come close to the available supply. [The Hechinger Report]

4.0
The “Glass Ceiling Index” for companies listed on the S&P 1500, where are four times as many CEOs named James, Robert, John or William as there are women in the top spot. [The Upshot]

5 p.m.
The best time to post something to Instagram (ideally also on a Wednesday) to get hella likes. Another good time is 2 a.m., presumably to grab those late left-coast likes and the night owls of the East. [The Huffington Post]

10 percent
The way we rate hospitals is inconsistent, and makes it harder to determine true quality. A study compared four national hospital-rating systems and found 844 hospitals that were considered “high-performing” on at least one list. The issue? Only 10 percent of those hospitals were deemed high performers on any of the other lists. [Health Affairs, via Adrianna McIntyre]

45 percent
Come, visit beautiful Russia. Compared to last year, the average price of a hotel room in the country fell by $80 for users of the dollar, a 45 percent drop. This is because Russia’s currency is crashing. [Wonkblog]

63 percent lower
The best thing I personally do for my health is to take a regular schvitz at the Russian-Turkish Baths, a new study has found. The risk of cardiovascular death decreased by as much as 63 percent in men who went to the sauna often, compared to men who went only once a week. [The Wall Street Journal]

8,000 years
Earth has a weird rock following it around called 3753 Cruithne. This “quasi-orbital satellite” travels through space like a drunk and will be closest to us in about 2,750 years. Luckily, in 8,000 years or so it’ll get too close to Venus and may finally take the hint that we’re in a pretty serious relationship with the Moon and buzz off. [Discover Magazine]

73 million
Remember when we were all talking about that dress last week? I don’t, I was still pretty obsessed with the llamas. But many people on Tumblr were — the original image post got a whopping 73 million pageviews according to the Tumblr staff. [Tumblr]

$200 million
How much New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman is hoping to sell the paper for. A list of suitors is queuing up, one of whom is former mayoral candidate and the man behind the greatest Christmas card of all time John Catsimatidis. (Make sure to click through the link, because if the Post was put on this earth to do one thing it’s to throw shade at the Daily News.) [New York Post]

21 retired numbers
The New York Yankees retire a lot of players’ jersey numbers: 18 so far, with three more to come soon. While they won’t ever run out of numbers, it’s still going to be kind of inconvenient to get triple digits on a uniform. [The New York Times]

63 percent
Percentage of millennial-age Republicans who support the legalization of marijuana. That’s less than the 77 percent of millennial Democrats who support legal weed, but still high compared to other age groups within the GOP. [The Washington Post]

$10,802
Amount of government funds allegedly used by Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois to pay for a private flight to a Minnesota Vikings-Chicago Bears game in November. Schock is under scrutiny for allegedly spending taxpayer funds for personal uses. [Chicago Sun-Times]

Quantity of retail marijuana sold in the first year of legalization in Colorado, in addition to 109,578 pounds of medical marijuana. [The Hill]

40,000 years ago
Approximately when the Neanderthals disappeared from Europe. New evidence suggests that Homo sapiens sapiens was aided by trained wolves, the ancestors of modern dogs, in conquering them. This would place the domestication of dogs — man’s greatest achievement, let’s be real here — a lot earlier that previously thought. [The Guardian]

50,000 marchers
Approximate turnout to demonstrations in Moscow in support of recently killed opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. [The New York Times]

Two escaped llamas evaded capture in a Phoenix-area retirement community for about an hour yesterday. One was lassoed from a truck. America is great. [Associated Press]

3-2
The FCC voted 3-2 to prevent telecom companies from prioritizing web traffic to content providers who are willing to pay for faster speeds. Long story short, that person you know with opinions about “net neutrality” is probably pretty giddy right now. [Ars Technica]

5 miles
A test track for the Hyperloop — a high-speed train that’s the brainchild of billionaire industrialist and potential creator of Ultron Elon Musk — is planned for Quay Valley in California. [Wired]

6 months
The Huffington Post is out with an in-depth look at what really went on behind the scenes at “Pimp My Ride,” the hit MTV show from the 2000s. As it turns out, life wasn’t awesome for guests on the show. For instance, while it may have seemed like the eponymous rides were in the shop for a weekend at most, some cars were worked on for 6 to 7 months. [Huffington Post]

7 percent
The breakfast battlefield — which apparently is a thing — is in flux. Sales of eggs were up 7 percent last year, which hurt cereal sales. Kellogg spends more than $1 billion on advertising, but 19 of its top 25 cereals saw drops in sales last year. Carbs are bad, folks. [Bloomberg Business]

15 percent
Percentage of people who, in a survey conducted for the 92nd Street Y, said they, themselves, might be a genius. Dubious. [Fast Company]

18 weed vending machines
The future has arrived: Seattle just got its first cannabis vending machine, joining Arizona, California and Colorado, which have similar devices. [Good Magazine]

Almost 40 percent of the men’s underwear market is boxer briefs, a class of shorts that has eclipsed both boxers and briefs. [Bloomberg Business]

According to a new study out of Australia, 67 percent of smokers will die from a smoking-derived illness. [Washington Post]

14,000 workers
A labor dispute between 14,000 longshoremen and shipping companies ended recently, following months of slowdowns at west coast ports. About 90 percent of consumer goods in the U.S. were at one point transported on a container ship. [The Atlantic]

12
Ever wonder what the Madden rating would be if an average schlub off the street played in the NFL? I did, and I also happen to be an average schlub off the street. The answer, in my case, was 12 out of 99. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 percent
Despite (or perhaps because of) allegations that Bill O’Reilly may have misrepresented reporting he did in Argentina, the ratings for his show “The O’Reilly Factor” were up 22 percent in February, making it the top cable news show for 171 consecutive months. [AdWeek]

52 percent of Obamacare enrollees paying their taxes through H&R Block had to pay back some of their tax credit, with $530 on average being paid back to the government because their subsidies were too high. [H&R Block]

1,500 miles
The Port Authority is considering dropping a rule that limits flights out of LaGuardia Airport to fewer than 1,500 miles. This would open up the airport to flights to the west coast, and is favored by stakeholders like Delta Airlines who use the dumpster fire of a transit facility for flights out of New York. [The Wall Street Journal]

80,000 seats
The California city Inglewood approved plans to build an 80,000-seat NFL stadium at the cost of $1.86 billion. [Los Angeles Times]

$4.8 million
Lots of disclosures on this simple bit of news: Disney* will drop the Boy Scouts of America** from its Voluntears program*** in 2015. This means the company won’t match or donate to the BSA because of its anti-gay policies. In 2010, Disney gave $4.8 million to the scouts. [Boing Boing]
* Disney owns FiveThirtyEight by the transitive property.
** I was in the Boy Scouts for years.
*** A program I have not taken advantage of, but could.

$20 million
RadioShack, which has filed for bankruptcy, will attempt to sell its milquetoast and uninspiring name and trademarks. Bids for the brand’s name begin at $20 million, a price I assume was set by someone who has never asked an average American how she feels about “RadioShack.” [Bloomberg Business]

$23,581,250
Fines issued by speeding cameras in the city of New York in 2014. [WNYC]

12 billion suns
A giant black hole has been discovered, reportedly with the mass of 12 billion suns. I just re-watched “Interstellar” so this seems like the kind of thing that could lead to a real emotional revelation for whoever’s lucky enough to go near it. [National Geographic]

0.86 percent
Go ahead, claim that “home office” as a business expense*: the IRS only audited 0.86 percent of individual tax returns last year, the lowest rate in 10 years. However, if you make more than a million, the rate is 7.5 percent, so make sure you triple check whether or not you’re a millionaire before you set up your home office. [Bloomberg Business]

*DO NOT TAKE TAX ADVICE FROM ME!

3 states
Weed’s legal in Alaska as of yesterday, making it the third state to do so. Call me when one of you figure out how to make an Orca into a functioning bowl. [NBC News]

$9.00

JP Morgan did $9 worth of business with Iran last year, according to documents submitted to the SEC. The largest bank in the United States went to comically laborious lengths to explain the $9 transaction in its 10-K, the result of two bank transfer fees on behalf of a client. [Business Insider]

43 categories
My colleague Neil Paine published a deep dive into how the folks behind Madden determine the 43 unique category ratings for roughly 2,600 NFL players. [FiveThirtyEight]

45.3 percent
Chicago mayor and profanity innovator Rahm Emanuel failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote in Chicago’s mayoral election. He will have to win a runoff in April against challenger Jesus Garcia in order to maintain the mayoralty of America’s premier second city. [Chicago Sun Times]


176 square feet
Average space per office worker in 2012, down from 225 square feet in 2010. Thankfully many of us were prepared for the new status quo by those really small desks in high school. [The New York Times]

500 bricks
The people behind “The Lego Movie” doled out 20 faux Oscars at the ceremony on Sunday. It took 500 bricks to build one of them. Everything is awesome. [CNET]

$50,000


Taylor Swift donated $50,000 to New York City schools, royalties from her song “Welcome to New York.” More to come, reportedly. [The New York Times]



$100 million
Last year Actavis, a generically named pharmaecutical company, bought Allergan, another generically named pharmaceutical company, for $65 billion. Since that deal went down, there’s the somewhat awkward situation of a superfluous CEO, Allergan’s David Pyott, walking around. Rather than settle this the old fashioned way — two chief executive officers enter the thunderdome, one leaves — Actavis is probably going to pay Pyott $100 million to get fired. [Bloomberg Business]

$2 billion
HP, the one-time important and influential computing company, will split into two separate companies in three months, one for its enterprise and business products and another for its computer and printer businesses. The cost of the split, we learned Tuesday, will be about $2 billion. [Business Insider]

2.045 times as large
The market cap of the largest publicly traded U.S. company (Apple) is for the first time in 30 years more than twice the size of the market cap of the runner up (Exxon Mobil Corp.). Apple’s cap is $765 billion, Exxon’s is $374 billion. [Wall Street Journal]

Should a bill to fund the Department of Homeland security fail to make it into law, 30,000 employees will be furloughed. 80 percent of the DHS workforce is deemed essential to national security, yet as a person who has been through TSA screening that feels like a bit much. [USA Today]

$2,500

A labradoodle — a cross between a poodle and a labrador retriever — can sell for between $2,500 and $3,000, much more than a lab or a poodle (which can go for $1,000 to $2,000). [The Baffler]


18,000 text messages

The number of SMS requests a new startup called Magic received in a single day — just three days after launching. Magic is a delivery service that does all the work of finding an item for you, and, only a few days in, it can barely keep up with the demand. [Mashable]

4 Oscars
“Birdman” took home the Academy Award for best picture last night, and it won other trophies for original screenplay, direction and cinematography. It won the most Oscars on the night, but tied with “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” which won four prizes in score, costume design, production design and makeup/hairstyling. [USA Today]

4.6 percent

Percentage of major studio films directed by women in 2014 [Los Angeles Times]


62 cases

There’s been substantial scrutiny of policies at the Rikers Island correctional facility, which was the subject of a U.S. attorney’s report about brutality there this past summer. Since the release of that report in August, there have been 62 cases of inmates sustaining serious injuries from corrections officers, The New York Times found. [The New York Times]


68 percent female
While a lot of the original web “culture” was formed by white dudes, that’s changed since new mobile technology has opened up the space to other groups. Instagram users, for instance, are reportedly 68 percent female. [Kernel Magazine]

$105
Cost for a day pass to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando as of Sunday, up from $99. It’s thought to be the first place in the theme park biz to jump above a hundred. Fun fact/full disclosure: this website is owned by Disney, which does, indeed, own Disney World. [Reuters]

1-in-4 IPOs
While a lot has been made of the potential for a tech bubble, flying under the radar is the possibility of a biotech bubble. One-in-four initial public offerings in 2014 were biotech firms, and medical device and biotech firms raised $8.6 billion in private funding last year. Many of these companies need to pass regulatory and scientific hurdles, so they’re a hell of a gamble. My conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio is a much safer play. [Quartz]


6 feet
A new report from the New York City Panel on Climate Change says sea levels could rise by as much as six feet by 2100 in the worst-case scenario. The panel’s previous worst-case estimate was 2-4 feet. [Scientific American]

$9 per hour
Wal-Mart, the largest retailer on Earth, announced it will raise the minimum wage of its U.S. employees to $9 per hour. It is the latest sign the growing economy may finally be boosting the pay of low-wage workers. [FiveThirtyEight]

24.8 percent

Percentage of uninsured Americans with incomes above the poverty line who said they had heard nothing about a tax penalty next year for those who remain uninsured, a part of the Affordable Care Act. [Urban Institute]

26 percent
Increase in the average weight of pickup trucks since 2000. The trend toward bigger pickups has been driven, in part, by Americans liking big trucks — pretty sure that’s in the constitution somewhere. But federal regulations, which allow bigger vehicles to be less fuel-efficient, have also played a role. [Bloomberg Business]

38 percent
Percent of Americans who have passports, up from 3 percent in 1989. This, if anything, means this country has become less patriotic — I had a layover in Canada once when I was 10, and I still feel undeserving to call myself an American. [Dadaviz]

385 percent
This year’s top Oscar nominees — those contending for best picture, best director, best actor and best actress — saw their illegal download rate increase an average of 385 percent in the 30 days after nominations were announced. “This is why the fifth amendment exists,” exclaimed a local lifestyle writer. [Bloomberg Business]


1,009 weeks
A Bollywood rom-com,”Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” just wrapped up the longest theatrical run ever, 1,009 weeks at the Maratha Mandir. The run began in October 1995. That’s as if “Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls” had been in a theater since its premiere. [Yahoo News]

Approximate cost to book Salt-N-Pepa for your wedding, bar mitzvah or particularly awesome funeral. There’s a whole cottage industry around booking elapsed acts from the 1990s for private events. [Bloomberg Business]

19 stunt people

There’s been a push for the Academy Awards to create a technical award for Hollywood stunt performers for decades, but the lobby is somewhat hampered by numbers: Only 19 of the roughly 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were stunt people in 2011. [A.V Club]


76 percent of Republicans
George W. Bush left the White House with abysmal approval ratings, but even then, a majority of Republicans approved of his foreign policy performance. Now, as Jeb Bush gears up for a presidential run sounding a lot like his brother on foreign policy, the GOP remains plenty hawkish; 76 percent of Republicans think military force will be needed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [FiveThirtyEight]

73 companies
Number of startups with a valuation over $1 billion according to venture capitalists. Of the 73 companies, 23 make software, 13 work in e-commerce and 13 are consumer-oriented Internet services. [The Wall Street Journal]

450 calories per slice
Little Caesars has unveiled a new pizza with 3.5 feet of bacon wrapped around its crust. At 450 calories per slice, the crust is beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night, the pie as fair as the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountain, dreadful as the storm and the lightning, stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love it and despair! It costs $12. [USA Today]

800 acts of emotional manipulation and casual cruelty
It seems like every year some college or university mistakenly tells a bunch of rejected applicants that they’ve been accepted. This year, it was Carnegie Mellon University. The school, which is supposed to be good at tech, e-mailed 800 anxious applicants on Monday to tell them they were accepted into a master’s program in computer science. They were not. [Bloomberg Business]

$1,930.60

That was the average price on the secondary market for tickets to the Duke vs. University of North Carolina basketball game last night. [Forbes]

50,000 bitcoins

The U.S. government will auction off roughly $12 million worth of the digital currency bitcoin seized in the bust of the Silk Road, a drug-trafficking website. [The New York Times]



$300,000
VICE founder Shane Smith is reported to have dropped $300,000 on a single dinner in Las Vegas. There are conflicting accounts of the size of the party that racked up the mighty bill; reports range from 12 to 25 people. What could they possibly have ordered? I mean, for $300,000 I would probably let someone “Most Dangerous Game” me. [Bloomberg Business]

700,000 cartons of cigarettes
New York (state and city) brought a lawsuit against UPS on Wednesday for allegedly shipping 700,000 cartons of cigarettes from Native American land upstate, where tobacco is not taxed, to the rest of the state. This meant about $35 million in lost tax revenue. [Huffington Post]

39 times per week
In the U.S., a foreign object is left inside a patient after surgery 39 times per week. My research found no evidence any of these objects are adamantium skeletons — they are sponges, towels, etc. — so this seems like an unconditionally bad thing. [Wall Street Journal]

70 episodes

John Oliver, the former-Daily Show correspondent turned late-night host, has signed a two-season deal with HBO. The popular program has been green-lit for two more 35-episode seasons, presumably ending speculation about Oliver taking “The Daily Show” chair. [Los Angeles Times]

2,100.34

The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high, exceeding 2,100 points for the first time following good news out of Greece and a rise in technology shares. Congratulations, America, for passing an arbitrary number that is divisible by some power of 10 — the bread-and-butter of all financial news. [Bloomberg Business]


5,788 votes
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has the best attendance record in the Senate, with 5,788 votes cast and zero missed. The same cannot be said of several of her colleagues. Sen. Marco Rubio leads the no-show pack with 8.3 percent of votes missed. [Vocativ]

5th place

Thomas Jefferson would be the first to get dynamited off Mount Rushmore if we ever get around to throwing Franklin D. Roosevelt up there. Historians, according to an average of three recent surveys, rank FDR as the No. 1 president. Jefferson is fifth, behind FDR, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Theodore Roosevelt. [FiveThirtyEight]

10 inches

The Washington Monument just got 10 inches shorter, thrilling people who are inherently skeptical of tour guides. The obelisk — originally recorded as a stalwart 555 feet, 5.125 inches — is instead a puny and utterly laughable 554 feet, 7.344 inches. The monument hasn’t actually shrunk, though. The measurers just started the tape measure in a different place. [Chicago Tribune]

Sierra Leone did not properly account for how it spent $5.7 million in Ebola aid, about 30 percent of overall funds, according to a new report. [BBC]

37 years in prison

Great job, everybody! People have kept it together in New York City and did not kill a fellow human since Feb. 1. In fairness, even if someone wanted to (and break the 11-day record-setting streak), it would probably be too much work with all this cold and ice. [New York Daily News]


62nd
Professional golfer Tiger Woods’s world ranking after a rough 2014 and a bad start to 2015. That’s his lowest since he went pro. [CNN]

53 percent of voters

For the first time, a majority of New Jersey voters have an unfavorable view of Republican Gov. Chris Christie. In my expert opinion as FiveThirtyEight’s New Jersey resident, the guy had it coming after that Dallas Cowboys crap. [Reuters]

$62.15 per barrel

A survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal found the consensus projection for the price of crude oil by December is $62.15 per barrel. Then again, the conventional wisdom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. [The Wall Street Journal]


60,000 deaths per year
Smoking — which is, believe it or not, dangerous — was linked to five more diseases in a new study, specifically kidney, intestinal, heart and lung ailments. In the U.S., the diseases would add 60,000 people to smoking’s death toll annually. [The New York Times]

$3,327,757
A tabletop game based on the “Conan the Barbarian” series has just wrapped up the largest-ever Kickstarter funding round for a board game in the crowdfunder’s history. [The Escapist]

12.7 million metric tons
Humanity is not great at getting rid of garbage. The simplest solution is often to just dump it in the ocean. Scientists estimate that 12.7 million metric tons of plastic was dumped in the ocean in 2010, making for a lot of very sad dolphins (presumably). You know the Great Pyramid of Giza? That really big one? Those 12.7 million metric tons are double the weight of that thing. [Ars Technica]

21 million
The number of adults in the U.S. who practiced some form of yoga in 2012, double the number from 2002. [National Institutes of Health]

$44 million
Colorado scored $44 million in tax revenue from recreational marijuana last year, $25 million less than expected. The Colorado marijuana industry is basically like the college roommate who overpromises on rent: To make up for the shortfall, they’re definitely going to try to sell more weed. [The Daily Beast]

After intervention from France and Germany, there’s a new cease-fire scheduled for Sunday in Ukraine. Ukraine will also see a $40 billion aid package as part of the deal. [NPR]

3 winners
Wednesday night’s Powerball lottery drawing had three winning tickets. The final advertised jackpot of $564 million was the fifth-biggest in U.S. history. Earlier Wednesday, when the jackpot was estimated to be $500 million, I wrote there was a 67 percent chance at least one person would win. [ABC News]

4 reactors
After the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster, Japan shut down all its nuclear reactors. On Wednesday, two of those reactors were green-lit to resume generation, joining two reactors already reauthorized to resume. That means there will still be 44 idle commercial reactors. [Kyodo News]

8 percent ABV
Bud Light has created three new monstrosities known as MIXXTAILS, beverages that are 8 percent alcohol by volume and flavored to taste like a cocktail. Our nation has still not recovered from the Four Loko craze. [Eater]

15 to 60 minutes

SpaceX on Wednesday launched a satellite designed to monitor solar storms. The satellite is called Dscovr — presumably losing a couple of vowels to drop weight and save on fuel costs — and can give Earth between 15 and 60 minutes’ notice if an electromagnetic wave of energy ejected from the sun is poised to hit us and cause mass communication and electrical disruption. So that’s nice. [The New York Times]


22 percent

Do you keep a motion tracker on your wrist? I used to, but then I lost it while inebriated, during a FitBit-throwing contest that I totally won. It turns out I may have made the right call; the device might have been logging more steps than I took. Researchers have found there is up to a 22 percent difference between the number of steps a wristband logs and the number someone takes. [Mother Jones]

45 percent
According to the National Science Foundation, 45 percent of Americans believe in astrology, up from 32 percent in 2006. I blame the “Battlestar Galactica” reboot. [The Washington Post]

75 percent

There’s a surprising amount of work that goes into perfect popcorn. We’ve figured out the ideal moisture content, weight and shape for kernels, and since 1950 have cut the unpopped kernel rate by 75 percent. [Los Angeles Times]


9,834 Teslas
Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, moved 9,834 vehicles in the fourth quarter 0f 2014, missing expectations of analysts and internal goals. The company announced it intends to move 55,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles in 2015. [Bloomberg Business]

60,000 tons of salt

Boston, the frozen tundra that drivers eventually hit when they miss their exit to New York, has dumped 60,000 tons of salt onto its roads after this season’s unrelenting snowfall. The city that was known for dumping its sewage into its harbor is naturally considering dumping its snow into its harbor. When all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. [Popular Science]

$200 million
The amount of Russian money invested in condominiums in New York City’s Time Warner Center. The New York Times identified 20 such condos bought by Russians or citizens of the former Soviet bloc. This is part of a larger trend of foreign investment paying top dollar for the city’s real estate. [The New York Times]

2 shipments
A confidential United Nations report reveals that two shipments from North Korea to the Syrian government agency responsible for that country’s chemical weapons program have been intercepted over the past six months by two U.N. member nations. [Reuters]

63 cents
Questionable — or even fake — polls are having real-world influence. A recent poll showing musician Kid Rock leading the U.S. Senate race in Michigan preceded a wave of bets against his prospective opponent, incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, on the betting site PredictIt: Stabenow’s share price tumbled from 78 cents to 63 cents before recovering to 70 cents at the end of the day. One problem: The poll came from a previously unknown polling firm and may have originated from PredictIt speculators. [FiveThirtyEight]

$50 million
Amount of money wagered on the 2015 fight in Nevada between boxers Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Somehow the upcoming bout between the still-undefeated Mayweather and boxing-newcomer Conor McGregor appears to be headed north of that, with a bookies estimating nearly $70 million will be wagered. Despite the inherent underdog quality of McGregor, people are still scrambling to bet on him, albeit in smaller quantities: At MGM Resorts, the average bet on McGregor is $112, versus $3,700 for Mayweather, with 6,000 transactions on McGregor to 200 for Mayweather.

Rating are way up in 2017 for feel-good television network Hallmark Channel, with viewership up 9 percent so far this year. This doesn’t even factor in the huge Christmas bump for the cable channel, which in the holiday season punches up there among the likes of Fox News and ESPN. [The Washington Post]

11 songs
A Bloomberg analysis of the top 20 spots of the Billboard Hot 100 over the past three years found that the most popular brand name dropped was — somewhat unexpectedly — Rolls-Royce, which was mentioned in 11 songs. Eight of the top 12 brands are vehicles; the other four are Hennessy cognac, Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers, Rolex watches and Xanax. I really hope Xanax never makes a car. [Bloomberg]

17 percent
Your car may be losing value faster than in the past: On average, the value of a U.S. used car dropped 17 percent over the past 12 months. In 2014, that figure was 9.5 percent. There’s a glut of automobiles for sale, which drives prices down. On the other hand, this may explain why automakers pursue pop stars to move products. [Bloomberg]

Today, a large portion of the United States will experience a solar eclipse! Here’s an all-eclipse version of Significant Digits. I’ll be co-anchoring ABC News’ digital coverage of the eclipse, watch it here.

1 hour, 33 minutes, 16.8 seconds
Duration of the eclipse on U.S. soil today from Oregon to South Carolina. A solid 70-mile-wide swath of the country coast-to-coast will get to experience a total solar eclipse for anywhere from a few seconds to over two minutes. It may be responsible for the largest mass migration to see a natural event in human history. [The Atlantic]

45 million pairs
Number of eclipse glasses — the approved way to view a solar eclipse without permanent retina damage — sold by American Paper Optics (one of the few authorized sellers of certified glasses) over the past two years. Do what you can to get your hands on a pair; it’s unsafe to attempt to stare directly at the sun. [ABC News]

1,651 miles per hour
Average speed of the eclipse as it sprints across the country. While the big event is going on, a considerable amount of research will be happening, as briefly blocking out the sun is a handy way of studying everything from earth’s ionosphere to how animals react to eclipse-induced midday temperature and light swings. [FiveThirtyEight]

75 million
Approximate number of people who live within a 200-mile drive of the path of totality across the country. About 12 million people live directly in the path of totality; experts estimate they could be joined by about 7.4 million people traveling to watch the eclipse. That could make for some serious traffic and clogged cellular networks. [FiveThirtyEight, Curbed]

29
Number of interstate highway routes that the total solar eclipse crosses. State and local officials are working to ensure that first responders and highway crews can react in a timely matter with or without access to cellular networks. [Time]

3.2 percent
Percent of energy generated in North Carolina from solar power in 2016. The nation is about to experience a slight dip in solar power generation, and the planning to react to the eclipse has underscored a number of issues regarding the state of infrastructure in the U.S. Regardless of how this time goes, by 2024 — the next time the U.S. is due for a solar eclipse — we’ll need to be ready.

Drop in the S&P 500 Thursday, the second largest one-day drop of the year for the index, and part of a broader slip in markets yesterday that was partially triggered by a rumor that the top economic advisor to the president and ex-Goldman Sachs exec Gary Cohn was resigning. That rumor was fueled by an inaccurate tweet from a breaking news Twitter account. Man, if that’s how markets handle Cohn not leaving the administration I’d hate to see how they’d handle it if he ever does. [Business Insider]

India is seeing a huge media opportunity in an unlikely place: FM radio. Radio revenue in India increased 18 percent in 2016 to $416 million across 313 commercial FM radio stations and a state broadcaster. That revenue is small compared to the U.S. market, but the growth is explosive even compared to markets like Brazil and China (under 3 percent). Plus, the rights to 800 more stations are being auctioned off over the coming years. [The Wall Street Journal]

62 percent
Percentage of Americans in an August poll who considered North Korea a very serious threat, up from 48 percent in the same poll back in March. Meanwhile, a Marist University poll found only 19 percent of Americans have a great deal of confidence that President Donald Trump can lead the country through an international crisis. [FiveThirtyEight]

30,000 members
Number of members who left the American Civil Liberties Union over their legal defense of a neo-Nazi group in the late 1970s. The ACLU assiduously fights cases on first amendment law, and defending the rights of hate groups like the neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to demonstrate and distribute fliers tend to be the provocative cases that skirt the edges of that kind of law. In light of the incidents in Charlottesville, Va. last weekend, the ACLU announced yesterday that it will no longer defend hate groups that attempt to incorporate firearms into their demonstrations. [The Wall Street Journal]

1.7 million
Number of elective plastic surgeries in the U.S. in 2016, of which more than 200,000 were nose jobs. The plastic surgery business is an interesting one with a fascinating gender gap: 75 percent of the people who got those rhinoplasties were women, but 85 percent of board certified plastic surgeons are men. [Racked]

7.5 million
Any discussion of jobs at risk of elimination tends to focus on the manufacturing sector, but it’s truly retail — the most common job in America — at the most profound risk. There are 7.5 million jobs in retail at high risk of computerization. Cashiers, who number 3.5 million, may be in the worst position of all. [The Guardian]

Number of orca deaths at SeaWorld parks this year, the latest resulting from the euthanization of a 42-year old female Kasatka at its San Diego park. SeaWorld is phasing out its orca performances by 2019. [Associated Press]

7 episodes
Number of episodes of “There’s… Johnny,” a sitcom about the backstage crew of “The Tonight Show” that was produced for streaming network Seeso as its tentpole comedy. Here’s the issue: Seeso was shuttered before the program could even go to air, raising a fundamentally modern question of what happens to shows that outlast their streaming start-up network. [The Wall Street Journal]

Difference between the labor force participation of men and women in the United States in July, an all-time low. [Bloomberg]

Favorable opinion of Russia in Vietnam, the highest in the world according to Pew Global; only Greece and the Philippines also have a majority positive opinion of Russia. [Pew Research Center]

111
Passer rating of Jags quarterback Blake Bortles during garbage time over the past two seasons, one point off Tom Brady’s overall quarterback rating last season. Granted, Bortles is only good during garbage time, that magical period in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter when a team is two or more scores back and Blake is throwing as if his job depends on it.

Number of NBA teams that will play four games in a five-night span this year, which is part of a league-wide scheduling plan to implement more rest days so that top talent can continue playing in those late-season must-watch games. On average, teams will play 14 back-to-backs compared to 16 last season. [FiveThirtyEight]

6 years, 5 months
Sentence for a man who accidentally discharged a gun while taking a selfie in “Club Lust,” a Florida strip club. [The Associated Press]

38.6 percent
Percentage of a 16 GB iPhone 6 that is aluminum and iron. The cocktail of other precious and base metals that go into the phones — 0.02 grams of bismuth here, another 0.014 grams of gold there, the little 0.01 grams of gallium to top it all off — have to come from somewhere, and the answer isn’t always pretty. [Motherboard]

38.9 percent
Former Chief Justice Roy Moore and Sen. Luther Strange will move on to the runoff stage of the special Alabama primary election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s seat in the the Senate. Moore — who was suspended from the bench for refusing to enforce the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage — won the first vote with 38.9 percent of the vote. Strange, who received 32.8 percent of the vote, was appointed to the seat by disgraced Alabama ex-Gov. Robert Bentley and has the support of President Trump. The winner of the GOP primary in Alabama is as close as one can get to a lock to win the general election, which will be held in December. [FiveThirtyEight, New York Times]

40 percent
The antique furniture market has taken a hard hit — with English antique furniture seeing a 40 percent drop in value over 10 years — in part because millennials don’t want to buy them. [Marketplace]

1.4 percent
Percentage of U.S. consumers with a FICO credit score that is a perfect 850. The number is hugely consequential when it comes to securing credit, and many aspire to that top figure and will use all the idiosyncrasies of the algorithm to get there. Indeed, the percentage of Americans with 800+ credit scores is steadily rising. [Bloomberg]

8 out of 7,287
Only eight of 7,287 music albums released between 2012 and 2016 got generally unfavorable (that is, bad) reviews on Metacritic. This means that either humans got really, really good at not making bad music; there’s a systemic disincentive for doling out bad reviews; or aggregating ratings is an incomplete portrait of the musical scene. [The Wall Street Journal]

11 points
Generally speaking when the president is at an approval rating of 38 percent we’d expect (historically) the president’s party to lose 11 points or so off its House margin of victory. If the midterms held today in the current congressional playing field, the GOP would lose the national House vote by 10 points. [FiveThirtyEight]

18.6
Average number of career receptions for the five wideouts remaining on the New York Jets. It’s really hard for a team to go 0-16 in the NFL, but let’s just say there’s a reason the Jets are in the conversation this year. [FiveThirtyEight]

21 percent
Percentage of shoppers at natural food supermarkets who didn’t know or had at best a rough notion of what “hormone/steroid free” means vis-a-vis buying meat. Still, those buzz words have pulled major chicken producers like Perdue towards investing in antibiotic free birds. [Bloomberg]

4.6 insurers
Average number of insurers in a sample of 20 states and D.C. that will participate in the Affordable Care Act marketplace in 2018, down from an average of 5.1 insurers in a given state in 2017. Trump administration threats to undermine the stability of the Affordable Care Act system have led insurers to increase premiums for 2018 — in many markets, by double digits — a nonpartisan study has found. [Kaiser Family Foundation, Associated Press]

28 times as likely
A study of English titles in the Google Books catalog found that books published from 2005 to 2008 were 28 times as likely to include profanity than books published in the 1950s, which on one hand, duh, but on the other that’s pretty substantial jump that it’s worth asking questions about. [The New Republic]

48.4 percent
Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan said last week that Wall Street is beating Silicon Valley by a wide margin when it comes to gender equality, and the numbers bear out that thinking: 48.4 percent of top bank’s employees are women, compared to 33.2 percent in the Valley. [Axios]

50.2 percent
U.S. cremation rate in 2016, the first time a majority of Americans favored cremation over the alternatives. The National Funeral Directors Association is forecasting that in 2025, 63.8 percent of people who die in the U.S. will be cremated. [The New York Times]

60 pillows
What does it take to be a pillow tester? Patience. Perseverance. Determination. Finding the perfect pillow isn’t easy, and involves a lot of trial and error. In this case it turns out that the 60th time’s a charm, as experts had to test 60 pillows on their quest to find the perfect one. We’ll save you the time and effort… you can find your perfect pillow right here. Sponsored by Casper

40 shows
Today Facebook is unveiling its new Watch feature, which will have about 40 different shows from online publishing partners. The service is likely to debut in full on Aug. 28. [Business Insider]

46.5 percent
Quick check-in on generic-ballot polling while Congress takes its summer break: As of Wednesday, when Americans are asked whom they’d support in a congressional election, a generic Democrat is pulling 46.5 percent support compared to 37.1 percent going for a generic Republican. [FiveThirtyEight]

85 percent
President Trump’s approval rating among likely Alabama Republican primary voters, which, whoa that’s high. This is helpful for interim Sen.

12 sex parties

Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he had “only” had 12 sex parties over three years, pushing against perceived exaggerations from prosecutors. Everything in moderation, right? [BBC]


15 percent

Brian Williams was suspended for six months by NBC. I get that this is a story because a television personality was caught lying, but let’s be honest: For all the ink spilled on the matter, only 15 percent of people ages 18 to 29 were able to identify the “NBC Nightly News” anchor in 2013. The nightly news format is not exactly the pulse of the nation anymore. This is inside baseball. [Poynter]

On the other hand …

16 years
After 16 years behind the desk, Jon Stewart announced Tuesday night that he intends to step down from hosting duties of “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.” His departure date hasn’t been set. Brace yourself, because the entire Web on Wednesday will be a paroxysm of piping-hot takes about Stewart, meaningless aggregations of him saying things about stuff, rampant speculation about his successor, and people complaining about the preceding items. I recommend avoiding the space entirely. [The Wall Street Journal]

18 percent

The New York City subway system was originally designed to bring people living in the outer four boroughs into the core of the city, Manhattan. But intra-borough commutes are on the rise, up 18 percent over a decade. [Regional Plan Association]

32 percent
Only 32 percent of donated hearts are accepted for transplants, down from 44 percent in 1995. About 20,000 Americans “would benefit from a heart transplant” annually. [Bloomberg Business]


115 mph winds
SpaceX on Tuesday delayed the launch of a weather satellite for the second time. The company — run by Elon Musk, the billionaire industrialist who is one more bad day away from super-villainy, if you ask me — called off the launch within 12 minutes of takeoff because of inclement weather, 115 mph winds that were miles higher. [Associated Press]

3,959 victims
The Equal Justice Initiative has released a report compiling 3,959 lynchings that occurred in the American South from 1877 to 1950. [The New York Times]

$118,500

Local governments are “phallible”: The council of Aukland, New Zealand, spent NZ $160,000 — about $118,500 USD — on a set of wire sculptures for a public art installation. The work looks like a penis, and people aren’t happy. As someone who went to an all-boys Catholic high school, allow me to assure you there’s no way this was unintentional. [Hyperallergic]

$850 million
Apple is putting up $850 million toward a solar farm in Monterey, California, with the intention of using the generated power for its operations in the state. The 1,300-acre farm would produce 130 megawatts, enough to power 50,000 homes. [The Verge]

$5.1 billion
Americans put loads of money toward an ill-defined adjective in 2014, with “organic” groceries accounting for some $35 billion in spending. About $5.1 billion of that was on organic dairy, a figure that may go a long way to explain why grocery stores are running out of organic milk. [Bloomberg Business]

Tablet magazine, a Jewish culture site, will now charge $2 for any user to comment on its articles for a day, with bulk deals at $18 for a month of commenting and $180 for a year. [Capital New York]

7.5 percent growth
India posted a spectacular rate of year-on-year growth — 7.5 percent, compared to China’s 7.3 percent — that has raised some eyebrows. Part of the reason for the higher growth rate is changes in the way its government calculates the statistic. [Reuters]

This growth rate estimate leads us to our next number …

13 bullshits

An analysis of swearing in “Nature” has found that uses of profanity in the preeminent scientific journal are few and far between. There have been 48 uses of derivatives of the word “shit,” 13 uses of “bullshit”  and “8 deliberate fucks in roughly 145 years.” [Stuart Cantrill]

40 percent
According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, 40 percent of respondents said they thought “NBC Nightly News” anchor Brian Williams should resign. Williams was caught overstating details from anecdotes about his time reporting in Iraq. That number indicates that he essentially has to save Veronica Corningstone from a bear attack to recover. [Huffington Post]

81 percent

Percentage of Russians who said their opinion of the United States is very or mainly bad. I blame “Taken 3.” [Bloomberg Business]



5,360 subscribers
The number of fixed broadband subscribers in Cuba in 2013. The country has about 11.3 million people, who once wired with broadband might be a huge potential market for Netflix. The company just announced it intends to move into the island nation (though very few there could currently afford the video-streaming service). [Bloomberg Business]

34,000
Soon, 34,000 medical students will be matched to residency programs at hospitals with the National Resident Matching Program algorithm. Last year, 94.4 percent of residents were matched. [FiveThirtyEight]

The homeless population in New York City shelters this month, up from 52,144 last year. The city plans to allocate more funding and resources to reaching out to the unsheltered homeless. [The New York Times]

191,000 Islamic State fighters
The difference between the low estimate (9,000 fighters, from CNN’s Barbara Starr) and the high estimate (200,000 fighters, from a former chief of staff to the Kurdish president) for the ranks of the Islamic State. That’s a wide range, underlining the difficulty in estimating the true figure. [War on the Rocks]

6.9 million viewers
“Better Call Saul,” the Bob Odenkirk-helmed spinoff from the hit AMC drama “Breaking Bad,” premiered Sunday night to the highest-rated cable debut ever, with 4.4 million viewers among the 18-to-49 demographic and a total of 6.9 million viewers. [Deadline]

4 in 10 North Americans
People aren’t great at getting information from nutritional labels. A Nielsen survey found that 4 in 10 North Americans said they had only partial understanding, at best, of the labels. If you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to getting my daily recommended serving of riboflavin from a sleeve of Oreos. [Fast Company]

48 percent
Percentage of men with college degrees who married women with college degrees in 2005, which is almost double the rate from 1960. This may contribute toward additional educational opportunities for the children of such a couple compared to the children of couples without that level of education. [The Economist]

90 percent decrease

BlackBerry — the Canadian smartphone manufacturer that’s had a steady decrease in smartphone share in recent years — has seen its market value drop more than 90 percent since the heady days of 2008. The company’s home in Waterloo, Ontario, has taken a hit as well. [Fusion]

20,000 videos
Film buff (and late North Korean leader) Kim Jong Il had a collection of 20,000 videos in a private cinema beneath a Pyongyang bunker. He was also reportedly really into “Rambo,” by far the weakest of the Stallone films. I’m more of a “First Blood” guy. [GQ]

30,000 bank accounts
An investigation into HSBC’s Swiss banking arm looked at 30,000 accounts worth a total of $120 billion and found the private bank allegedly conspired with clients to evade taxes, had accounts with international criminals, and had lower standards of compliance than the rest of HSBC. [The Guardian]

$35.6 million
The record for a domain-name sale, for insurance.com, in 2010. That kind of generic domain name fetches a mighty price, and Gary Millin of World Accelerator is sitting on more than 1,000 like it, including email.com, fireman.com and bartender.net. I’m somewhat surprised he still controls toothfairy.com because my understanding is that she is positively loaded. [Motherboard]

$56 million

“The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water” took in $56 million at the domestic box office this weekend, according to Paramount. “American Sniper” remained a juggernaut, pulling in $24 million for a total of $282 million over seven weeks. [Deadline]

$300 million
An 1892 piece by Paul Gauguin has set the new record for most expensive painting sold. “When Will You Marry?” was reportedly sold to a museum in Qatar for $300 million. That’ll put that hack Paul Cezanne back in his place. [BBC News]

-$1.2 billion

Eike Batista, a former Brazilian billionaire, is roughly $1.2 billion in the hole. The financier is on trial for insider trading and market manipulation. Becoming a negative billionaire is very hard, but Batista managed it after a series of business failures and alleged financial crimes. [Bloomberg News]

0.2 percent
Stand clear of the closing doors, please: They are teeming with bacteria. A new study of the New York City subway found that the system is a thriving ecosystem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fragments of anthrax, and general crap. Almost half of the DNA on surfaces did not match any known organism. Only 0.2 percent of the DNA was even human. I don’t care what Harry says the wind chill is, I’m walking tomorrow. [The New York Times]

2.36 percentage points
A study suggests that when women become governors, more women are elected to their states’ legislatures in subsequent years. Four years after states voted a woman into the statehouse, the proportion of their legislators who were women rose by an average of 2.36 percentage points, after controlling for other variables. [Medium]

12 venomous snakes
Australia — where, as I understand it, every living thing is either poisonous, venomous, dangerous, or imported — is establishing a venom library in Melbourne, starting with 12 snakes that have been milked of venom. Researchers will try to develop new anti-venoms with the tissues and samples collected at the facility. [The Guardian]

14 designers

So far 14 designers have signed up for this summer’s New York Men’s Fashion Week. This sounds like a terrible idea, mostly because the middle of July is the worst possible time to wear a suit in the city. [New York]

37 seconds
Troubles began for TransAsia Airlines Flight GE235 just 37 seconds after takeoff on Wednesday, according to investigators. The flight crashed into the Keelung River, just east of Taipei Songshan Airport, soon afterwards, killing at least 35 of the 58 passengers and crew on board. [BBC]

Share of Americans who want regulations on privately owned drones, according to a new online poll. I know my rights, government, and once I strap a firework on to that quadcopter it falls under the second amendment, so buzz off. [Reuters]

250,000 license-holders
As part of an annual holiday event, the designers behind the horrible-but-also-delightful game Cards Against Humanity bought an island and gave each of the 250,000 event subscribers a license to one square foot of it. The island — dubbed Hawaii 2 — is in a lake in Maine. Yesterday the designers explained exactly how one buys an island. [Cards Against Humanity]

4 million MAUs

One major measure of participation for social media services is monthly active users (MAUs). So when Apple made changes to iOS 8 that caused Twitter to “lose” 4 million MAUs, it was a big deal for Twitter, which now has 288 million MAUs. [Quartz]

New data from the Planck telescope suggests that the first stars began to form about 550 million years after the Big Bang, which is 100 million years later than previously thought. [Press Association]

11 percentage points
Finally, an issue that the polarized left and right can approach —  almost sort of kind of — agreeing on. When asked whether all children should be required to be vaccinated, 76 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of Republicans, and 65 percent of independents said yes. That’s a margin of a mere 11 percentage points! Vaccinate your kids, people. [FiveThirtyEight]

21 percent

An investigation of herbal supplements by the New York State attorney general found that only 21 percent contained any DNA from the advertised plants. The supplements — which investigators purchased at Target, GNC, Walgreens and Walmart — were advertised as containing supplements such as ginseng or ginkgo balboa, but in fact often contained seemingly random vegetable matter. [CBS News]

68 percent approval
NASA continues to enjoy a solid favorability rating across the board, with 68 percent of Americans holding a favorable view of the space agency. NASA spent 0.5 percent of total federal outlays last year. Meanwhile, the IRS — which collects that coin — sits at a measly 45 percent favorability. [Pew Research Center]

99.8 pounds


American per-capita consumption of red meat has steadily declined while consumption of poultry has risen. This year, the average American is projected to consume more poultry (102.4 pounds) than red meat (99.8 pounds) for the first time in at least 50 years. [National Journal]

640 kilograms

Hafthór Björnsson, an Icelandic strongest-man competitor who plays a barbaric character on the popular television show “Game of Thrones,” has broken a millennium-old mythical record after taking five steps while carrying a log that weighs 640 kilograms (1,411 pounds). The 26-year-old is 6′ 9″ and is a living reminder that we should all be pretty thrilled the Vikings stopped doing that raiding thing a little while back. [New York Daily News]

10,000 Picassos
Pablo Picasso’s granddaughter Marina inherited about 10,000 of the artist’s works, and now is preparing to sell some of them privately. Her decision has prompted worries in the art world that she could flood the market and push down prices. I look forward to the day when I can grab one at a thrift shop. [The New York Times]

31,000 mph
NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft was over 126 million miles from former planet Pluto when it sent back its first grainy images of the distant rock. Based on the craft’s rate of travel, New Horizons should be at its closest approach on July 14, which is presumably when it will break the news to Pluto of its demotion to dwarf-planet status. [The Washington Post]

47,000 edits
Bryan Henderson, a Wikipedia editor who goes by the account Giraffedata, is on a solo crusade against a common grammatical error. He has made over 47,000 edits of the world’s largest encyclopedia since 2007, with a singular focus on ridding Wikipedia of the phrase “comprised of,” which he and many others consider to be an invalid English phrase.

Staples is buying Office Depot for $6.3 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. If the deal goes through, the only things that will stand between the paper juggernaut and world domination are the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company and the inevitable obsolescence of paper. [Reuters]

3.6 percent drop

It’s not often that a 3.6 percent drop in the value of a small hedge fund’s main fund gets the general public’s attention. But Eaglevale Partners LP was co-founded by the son-in-law of Bill and Hillary Clinton, two people who make the papers every now and then. The loss was blamed on the fund’s investments in Greece, which did not rebound as quickly as fund managers expected. [The Wall Street Journal]

22 percent cut
Californians cut water use by 22 percent last December from a year earlier. Their state’s drought is now in its fourth year. [The Associated Press]


25 percent

What happens if you don’t bother filing your taxes? I expected it would involve the fiery steel hammer of the U.S. government coming down from the heavens to annihilate all who dare taunt it, but it’s actually a penalty of up to 25 percent of what’s owed, along with the possibility of another penalty of 25 percent for being late, plus interest. That still sounds terrible. [Bloomberg Business]

55 years


Harper Lee, who 55 years ago published the iconic “To Kill A Mockingbird,” is planning to release a new novel, “Go Set A Watchman,” this July. The book was written in the 1950s, before “Mockingbird,” but is set 20 years later and features Scout’s adult life. [The Guardian]


56 repeal attempts
Yesterday marked the 56th House of Representatives vote to repeal or weaken some or all of the Affordable Care Act. If the previous 55 votes to repeal have set any any precedent, it’s that President Obama won’t consider signing the bill. But hey, who knows, maybe this vote will finally be the one to change his mind. [The New York Times]

61 percent
The median income for men with college degrees in Silicon Valley is 61 percent higher than the median income for college-educated women, a gap of $34,233. The comparable gender wage gap for the country as a whole is 48 percent. [The Wall Street Journal]

77 percent
A poll conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group on behalf of Fusion found that 77 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds couldn’t name either of their two U.S. Senators. In fairness, most Americans don’t know jack about civics, so there’s no reason to pick on the young folks. Moreover, the poll was conducted by telephone, which I’m told is an archaic form of communication that predates the internet. [Fusion]

20,580 euros
French Monopolists, rejoice: To commemorate the 80th anniversary of Monopoly in France, 80 buyers of the board game there will find actual cash in the till. One lucky buyer will get a set in which the 20,580 units of Monopoly money have been replaced with 20,580 euros, worth about $23,600. I assume the French version of the game involves substantially more striking. [Agence France-Presse]

$107,000
That was the maximum salary in the WNBA last season. Diana Taurasi made just under that sum to play for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury last summer. She’ll make more this summer by sitting out the WNBA season than she would have by playing it. Her Russian club team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, is paying her more than her Mercury salary just to rest and stay healthy for the Russian pro league, where she is earning nearly $1.5 million this winter. [espnW]

$1.5 billion


Standard & Poor’s will pay $687.5 million to the Justice Department, $687.5 million to a consortium of 19 states and Washington, D.C., and $125 million to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System to settle lawsuits regarding the credit rating company’s overly positive ratings of mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.

7-9 hours
The National Sleep Foundation is out with new recommendations for the amount of sleep people should get at different ages. For 18- to 25-year-olds, a new age category, the foundation’s scientific advisory council suggests getting seven to nine hours each night. [The Huffington Post]

10 percent drop
The Obama administration has pushed back the date by which it aims to end chronic homelessness by one year, to 2017. The number of chronically homeless people has dropped 10 percent since 2010. [Associated Press]

16 percent
Following a well-received speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gained standing among Iowa Republicans, taking 16 percent in a poll of potential Iowa caucus voters. Still, as my colleague Harry Enten explains, chaos is the true champion in the poll. [FiveThirtyEight]

34 percent
Advertisements made up a little more than one-third of the Super Bowl broadcast. The automobile industry alone is estimated to have spent a cumulative $121.5 million shilling cars and their ilk during the NBC telecast. [Bloomberg Business]

$80
Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan knows how to commit to a new gig. Last Friday, the ex-Jets coach got his tattoo of his wife in a Mark Sanchez Jets jersey color-corrected to a tattoo of his wife in a Bills jersey. The incoming coach was charged $80 by a Scottsdale, Arizona, tattoo shop, which is a total bargain, because I paid at least $120 to a guy on St. Mark’s Place to tattoo the damn FiveThirtyEight fox on my neck. [The Wall Street Journal]

676 percent increase
Missy Elliott’s killer performance during the Super Bowl halftime show has boosted popularity of the artist’s songs on digital-download and streaming services. Spotify streams of Elliott’s music — most of which came out in the late 1990s and early 2000s — rose 676 percent after her performance. [The Washington Post]


2,400 members
Iceland will get its first new major temple dedicated to Norse gods since the Viking era as Norse paganism makes a comeback. Membership in an organization that promotes faith in the old gods has tripled to 2,400 — less than 1 percent of the Icelandic population — in the past decade. [Reuters]

$50 million
RadioShack, a vestigial organ of the American economy, is being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. To remain listed, a company must clear a $50 million threshold with either its 30-trading-day-average global market capitalization or its stockholders’ equity. The Shack has a market cap of $24.19 million and negative shareholders’ equity. Good night, sweet prince. [NYSE via The Wall Street Journal]

114.4 million viewers

Sunday’s Super Bowl was watched by 114.4 million people in the U.S., breaking the record for largest TV audience set by last year’s Super Bowl. [The Hollywood Reporter]

$506 billion
President Obama has announced a plan to tax earnings held offshore by companies such as GE and Microsoft. His proposals — a one-time tax on earnings held abroad, then tax-code changes on future offshore profits — would raise an estimated $506 billion over the next 10 years. [Bloomberg]

4 cents per viewer
With an estimated cost of $4.5 million for a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement and more than 112 million people projected to watch the broadcast, advertisers with a 30-second spot paid about 4 cents per viewer — far more than the 2.5 cents per viewer that advertisers pay for a typical TV spot. [The Washington Post]

$12
Cost of a draft beer at University of Phoenix Stadium. Knowing that, I’m OK with Nate’s decision not to bring me along to the game. [SB Nation]

37 completions

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had a banner night (other than those two interceptions), completing 37 of 50 attempted passes and throwing for 328 yards, four touchdowns and the game’s MVP award. [The New York Times]

44 percent
One of the most talked-about TV ads — besides the one in which Nationwide gamed out all the ways to accidentally kill a kid — was the one Budweiser used to distance itself from the namby-pamby world of craft beer and play up its roots as the crappy beer of the common man. This creative direction shouldn’t be shocking for a brewer that recently learned 44 percent of drinkers aged 21 to 27 have never tried Budweiser. [Business Insider]

57.5 percent
The game effectively ended when the Seahawks — with a yard to go for a go-ahead touchdown — threw a pass that the Patriots intercepted. Many slightly-later-on-Sunday-evening quarterbacks second-guessed this play call, suggesting that a run would have been a safer option. During the regular season, 57.5 percent of rushing plays from the opponent’s 1-yard line resulted in a touchdown. [FiveThirtyEight]

71 ads
Perhaps you or someone you know was the person at the party who was there only to take in TV commercials. That’s cool: to each their own. NBC aired 71 unique national ads. [Business Insider]

73-45
Final score of the Puppy Bowl, the annual (sham) event aired by Animal Planet, which I really need to stop gambling on at this point. Cara, a Shih Tzu puppy, was named game MVP. Presumably many specialized vacuums were sold. [IGN]

98 seconds
Remember Ballghazi? As a person who dislikes the New England Patriots, I sure do. It turns out the attempts to reconstruct events are getting rather serious: Investigators are focusing on a 98-second window during which a worker took 24 game-day footballs into a restroom. Has this story gone on too long? Yes. Is the evidence conspiratorial and absurd? Of course. Is it funny, in a juvenile way, that grown adults are arguing over the size of balls? Probably. But is there a long offseason coming up? Damn right, and we’ll all need something to talk about. [NFL.com]


$921
Many speculators use the Super Bowl as an opportunity to make a quick buck. In recent years, people who sold short tickets on secondary sites could profit from an average price fall of $921 in the two weeks prior to the delivery date to buyers. That did not happen this year, leading to substantial chaos on the secondary markets for tickets. [The Atlantic]

$12 billion
Counting all the booze, food, electronics and merchandise, the National Retail Federation estimates Americans spent more than $12 billion on the game. [The Week]

9 communications majors

 It shouldn’t come as too much of a shock that the notoriously taciturn Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch is not among the nine communications majors taking the field in Super Bowl XLIX. Playboy broke down the college majors of every player in this year’s game, and communications came out as the most popular course of study, with nine players, followed by sociology and general studies, with seven players each. [Playboy]

11.8 percent
According to the NFL, concussions decreased by 11.8 percent this season compared to last year, to 202 from 229. [The New York Times]

14 percent rise
The average American office worker spends nine hours each week in meetings or thinking about meetings, up 14 percent from four years ago. [NPR]

25 megabits per second
The Federal Communications Commission raised the bar on the download speeds for “broadband” Internet to 25 megabits per second (Mbps) from 4 Mbps. Under the previous standard, 6.3 percent of households didn’t have broadband. Now 19.4 percent don’t. [Ubergizmo]


$50
John Kerry, the United States secretary of state, owes the city of Boston a $50 fine for failing to shovel his sidewalk. Kerry was in Saudi Arabia — a nation not known for its snow-clearance legislation — as a blizzard struck New England this week. [The Boston Globe]

63.9 percent
The home ownership rate is now at its lowest level since 1994, down to 63.9 percent in the final quarter of 2014. [Los Angeles Times]

96 tons
Amount of dog poop generated in New York City each day. [FiveThirtyEight]

98 percent of scientists
About 98 percent scientists say the public’s lack of knowledge about science is a problem, so why don’t you guys go learn a book or something, geez. [Re/code]

3,000 stories
I thought I was safe in journalism — I’d picked a good field, one that couldn’t be automated. I was wrong. The Associated Press is already automatically generating 3,000 stories each quarter. Right now, those stories are about companies’ quarterly earnings, but who knows when the robots will move on to the dog poop beat. [The Verge]

$1.3 billion
New York City cultural institutions spent $1.3 billion on new construction over the past five years on projects including the expansion of the Queens Museum and the renovation of the fountains at the Met. In 2014, construction expenditures were up 46 percent from 2013 to $208 million. [Crain’s New York]

0.44 Gronks
That’s how much snow Worcester, Massachusetts, got as measured in units of the 6-foot, 6-inch New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. The record-setting snowfall — which is expressed as “34.5 inches” west of the Connecticut state line — was one of the heaviest from a storm that otherwise disappointed some East Coast residents this week. [MassLive]

17 percent
According to the California Department of Public Health, 17 percent of the state’s high school seniors reported using electronic cigarettes. [Associated Press]

61 tattoos
Anthropologists finally have a handle on each of the 61 tattoos found on the preserved remains of Ötzi the Iceman, who lived around 3,300 BCE. Scientists were at first unable to to see all the tattoos, but now think they’ve mapped them all. Presumably one is a really tasteful tribal band, or perhaps something encouraging like “No Ragrets.” [io9]

66 students
As California continues to battle an outbreak of measles, 66 students of Palm Desert High School, not far from Palm Springs, were told they can’t come to class until Feb. 9 unless they can prove they’ve been immunized against the disease. [Los Angeles Times]

$138
Cab drivers in Seoul, South Korea, have asked passengers to pay a city-approved fine of 150,000 won, or about $138, should they vomit all over the back of a cab. Drivers hope the standard fine will discourage vomiting, which accounts for 42.5 percent of the complaints they file. [Stars and Stripes]

487 bytes
There’s a new record for the smallest fully playable version of computer chess. “BootChess” comes in at a tiny 487 bytes, smashing the previous record, held by “IKZX Chess” of 1983, which used 672 bytes of memory. [Geek.com]


768,000 vehicles
Nissan is recalling 786,000 vehicles — 640,000 of which are in the U.S. — due to problems with electrical shorts in some models and the hood-release cable in others. Those seem like important things, so you should definitely get your Nissan checked. [The Detroit News]

$3.85 billion
Facebook’s earnings are out and they’ve exceeded expectations. The social network’s revenue for the last quarter of 2014 was $3.85 billion, for a grand total of $12.47 billion in revenue last year. The vast majority of that revenue came from advertising, with 70 percent of ad revenue derived from mobile. [Business Insider]

$25 billion
Shareholders of Reynolds American, the company behind Camel cigarettes, approved a deal to take over Lorillard Inc., which sells Newport cigarettes, for $25 billion. Should the deal go through, the subsequent corporation would be the second-largest tobacco company behind Altria Group Inc., which owns Philip Morris. [Associated Press]

89 percent
Percentage of people who sent pro-marijuana messages on Twitter who are under the age of 25, according to a Washington University in St. Louis study of 7.6 million tweets. People 25 and older presumably have learned to keep that ish on the down low. [Pacific Standard Magazine]

Value of a statue of a bare-chested Celtic god of the sea, described as a “6-foot-tall striking local male with an athletic build,” missing from a Northern Irish town. Guys, I’m right here. [The New York Times]

$352,154.53
Estimate of how much American Airlines could save in yearly fuel costs by flying without Sky Mall catalogs weighing down its planes, assuming there are 37.5 pounds of Sky Malls on every American 737 hopping around the skies. It takes fuel, however little, to lug every pound to 35,000 feet on each flight, and that can add up in the aggregate. [Wired]

$9.2 million
Denmark plans to spend 60.9 million kroner, or roughly $9.2 million, over the next three years on programs aimed at de-radicalizing Islamic extremists. Most of the money will go to efforts to prevent young people from joining radical groups. [Associated Press]

40 million
Since 1996, the number of tourists visiting Times Square every year has doubled to 40 million. As a result, companies attempting to accomplish actual things — such as the publisher Condé Nast and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — are fleeing the seething hellhole of a neighborhood. [The New York Times]

$921 million
In the era of “freemium” apps, extra content is where the real money is. Games developer Electronic Arts saw a whopping 24 percent year-over-year growth in revenue derived from this extra content for its games, such as add-on levels or other downloadable content. The developer took in $921 million in revenue from extras, compared to $420 million from full-game digital downloads. [Polygon]

4 years
Thelma, a python, spent four years living the single life in a zoo in Louisville, Kentucky, but somehow managed to wind up pregnant and lay more than 61 eggs. Scientists say the snake had a virgin birth, and that female-only reproduction is far more common than we realized. [BBC]

5.5 percent
Films released in January account for an average of 5.5 percent of the annual total gross for wide-release films, making January the second-lowest grossing month after September. This means that movies that come out this month typically aren’t very good, and films are going to be bad for a few more months. [FiveThirtyEight]

12 percent
A Hunter College analysis of petitions for guardianship found that 12 percent of 700 cases filed in Manhattan were brought by nursing homes against their patients. Pursuing the costly litigation to gain guardianship of their elderly patients — and full legal powers and complete financial control over them — is a strategy some nursing homes use as a means of bill collection. [The New York Times]

12.5 percent
Listeners who noted a distinct similarity between Sam Smith’s 2014 song “Stay With Me” and Tom Petty’s 1989 tune “I Wont Back Down” have had their suspicions confirmed with news that Smith and Petty have settled out of court over owed royalties. Petty and singer-composer Jeff Lynne now have a 12.5 percent songwriting credit on “Stay With Me.” [Consequence of Sound]


16 percent decrease
Ratings for the NFL Pro Bowl, which I’m told happened Sunday, were down 16 percent from last year. [Sports Media Watch]

477 percent
Alcohol-delivery app Drizly said orders were up 477 percent on Monday in New York City and Boston compared to a typical Monday, as people gathered essentials ahead of a forecasted blizzard. [Business Insider]

600 plows
In case you haven’t heard, the East Coast got a little snow Monday night. Earlier on Monday the New York State Department of Transportation announced plans to activate 600 out of a total 1,444 available snow plows to handle the storm. [NY.gov]

$6 million
Should Alex Rodriguez hit six more home runs for the Yankees — to tie Willie Mays’s career total — he’ll get a $6 million bonus, and a further $6 million for each subsequent player he passes on the home-run list. (And remember, the Say Hey Kid got his number without substantial and systemic steroid abuse.) The Yankees are not enthusiastic about paying Rodriguez, who was suspended last year for using performance-enhancing drugs. [New York Daily News]

$899 million
The political network controlled by conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch announced its intention to spend $899 million on the 2016 campaign. For perspective, the Republican National Committee and its congressional campaign committees spent $657 million total in 2012. [The New York Times]

$2.04
Average price of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. on Friday, down $1.25 from a year ago. In many places, a gallon is less than $2, but the national average is dragged north by more expensive gas in Hawaii and Alaska. [Associated Press]

3.6 feet
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wants to fly helicopters on Mars, but achieving flight in the thin Martian atmosphere presents a tricky engineering problem. So far, scientists are experimenting with a helicopter prototype the size of a box of tissues, but the real deal would have a wingspan of 3.6 feet and would be equipped with a camera, to act as a scout for NASA’s rovers. [Vice]

26.9 inches
The current record for snowfall in New York City, a record that may very well be threatened as a colossal storm makes its way east early this week. As the city braces for the blizzard, area supermarkets basically look like something out of “The Purge” and my roommates are appearing to tire of me yelling “your Tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker!” every time they leave the apartment. [FiveThirtyEight]

75 percent
In order to say that your cabernet sauvignon is from Napa Valley, at least 75 percent of it must come from Napa cabernet grapes, with another 10 percent from Napa grapes of other varieties, but less than 15 percent from grapes from anywhere else in California, where wine is substantially cheaper. The Hill Wine Company flouted those rules, and many others, and now its owner is in a whole bunch of trouble with the government. [The New York Times]

80 percent
Brazil promised to cut the flow of raw sewage, pollutants and garbage into Guanabara Bay, outside Rio de Janeiro, by 80 percent in order to make the water safe for the sailing and wind surfing competitions at the 2016 Olympics. That’s not going to happen. [Associated Press]

$25,000
An unidentified buyer paid a Fort Worth, Texas, history buff $25,000 for a lock of Abraham Lincoln’s hair at an auction Saturday. It’s unclear whether the individual is a hair enthusiast, a Lincoln enthusiast, or some disconcerting combination of the two. [Reuters]

57 million
Dish Network was found guilty of breaking telemarking rules on 57 million occasions, in many cases calling people on the federal “Do Not Call” registry. Penalties can be up to $16,000 per outbound call, which could hypothetically put the satellite company on the hook for $912 billion. A trial is scheduled for July, but would any jury in America fail to put a telemarketer up against the wall if it had the chance? [CBS News via Slashdot]

$100,471,452.77
A mystery buyer has dropped nearly $100.5 million on a duplex penthouse in Manhattan’s new One57 skyscraper, making the sale the first to break the $100 million barrier in New York City. [The New York Times]

Atlantic City saw four casinos close and 8,000 people lose their jobs last year, an economic mess that could lead to the city’s property tax base falling from $11.3 billion to $8 billion by 2016.

In a marketing stunt, the publisher of James Patterson’s newest novel “Private Vegas” is selling a single copy of the book that is rigged to self-destruct within 24 hours. The price tag includes dinner with Patterson and a bomb squad to handle the detonation of the book, which will presumably take place in front of one of our nation’s many underfunded libraries. [Business Insider]

11 footballs
The NFL has found that 11 of 12 game balls used by the New England Patriots during Sunday’s AFC championship game were under-inflated, leading some to allege unfair play since doctoring footballs can provide a competitive advantage. [ESPN]

14 percent
Only 14 percent of legislative proposals pitched during President Obama’s 2014 State of the Union address have been enacted, up from a mere 5 percent in 2013 but far lower than in 2010. [FiveThirtyEight]

$24.99
Cost of the “Invisible Boyfriend” or “Invisible Girlfriend” service, an app designed to send you texts, calls and voicemails that help convince friends and family you’ve found love. Just under $25 gets you 100 texts, 10 voicemails and a handwritten note. [Business Insider]

64 percent
Percent of people who trust information from online search engines, a value that has for the first time eclipsed trust in traditional media sources, which is at 62 percent. [Quartz]

150 percent
The collapse of the Soviet Union may have led to a 150 percent increase in Russia’s gray wolf population in the following decade. Given his record with tigers, who knows how many wolves Putin’s taken down. [BBC]

350 miners
In Kosovo, 350 miners refused to return to the surface from their shift almost half a mile below ground, effectively beginning a subterranean strike. They’re protesting the government’s decision to back out of a plan that would have taken control of the bankrupt Trebka mining complex, [The New York Times]

6,000 feet per minute
The rate at which AirAsia Flight 8501 was climbing before it eventually crashed for unknown reasons, killing 162 people in December. Only fighter jets, according to Indonesia’s transport minister, normally climb at that rate. [Los Angeles Times]

39.11 million subscribers
Netflix earnings came out Tuesday, and the company exceeded Wall Street expectations, presumably because I elected to take a staycation in Q4 rather than go outside. The company announced that it ended the quarter with 39.11 million domestic and 18.28 international subscribers. That’s a whole lot of people thinking about finally getting into “Freaks and Geeks.” [Re/code]

$40 million
Amount “The Interview” has made from on-demand rentals. The film hits Netflix on Saturday. [CNN]

$100 million
FIFA, an organization that occasionally finds the time to plan some soccer games in between scandals, has set up a $100 million World Cup Legacy Fund for Brazil in an attempt to limit the negative impacts that hosting the event might have had on the nation. Brazil spent $15 billion on the 2014 FIFA World Cup. [Associated Press]

12 percent
GoPro stock is down 12 percent after it was reported that Apple has received patents for mounted digital cameras similar to GoPro’s, and that the patents specifically reference weaknesses in GoPro cameras. Presumably the company is kicking itself for not strapping a GoPro on the stock before it started to freefall. [Mashable]

13 percent more likely to drink
More money, more problems: People who work more than 48 hours per week are 13 percent more likely to engage in risky drinking than those working between 35 and 40 hours. [NPR]

16 percent of Republican men
Pew Research Center asked Americans if they hope the United States elects a female president in their lifetime. On the left, 69 percent of women and 46 percent of men indicated they hoped that would happen. On the right, 20 percent of women and a meager 16 percent of men agreed. [Pew Research Center]

32 percent down
The digital currency Bitcoin is in the middle of another crash, falling 32 percent in 2 days. One bitcoin went for $181.45 on Wednesday. Bitcoin was one the worst investments of 2014 — worse than the ruble or oil — losing 58 percent of its value. [Bloomberg]

Length of a wall Saudi Arabia plans to build along its border with Iraq. The wall is a combined fence and ditch, and had been discussed since 2006. As the power of the Islamic State in the region grows, Riyadh has sent 30,000 additional troops to the border. [Business Insider]

603 presents

Prince George, a well-known genetic lottery winner born into unimaginable wealth and privilege in July 2013, received 603 gifts from members of the Australian public. The gifts included clothing, books and sports equipment. I realize the kid could be king one day, but still, this is rather a lot of expectation to put on him. [The Telegraph]


4,074 uses of force
New York City corrections officers reported using force — ranging from pepper spray to punches — 4,074 times in 2014, an all-time high. [Associated Press]

$750,000
Reported cost of a one-day Snapchat ad. A masthead ad on YouTube goes for only about $500,000, and many advertisers are griping about Snapchat’s price. While we’re on the subject of costly decisions related to the ephemeral photo sharing app, I don’t know what exactly I sent to all of you last Friday at 1 a.m., but I am very curious why several of you screen-shotted it.

$22
Amount of cash carried by the median American consumer, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The study also found that 5.2 percent of consumers carried one or more $100 bills, but it failed to determine why they were always holding up the line in front of me at Starbucks. [Bloomberg Businessweek]

Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” of Americans who owe no federal income tax are now down to 40 percent. [Washington Post]

42 percent
Joseph Morrissey, a member of the Virginia Assembly, was re-elected to the House of Delegates with 42 percent of the vote. Morrissey, who first served as a Democrat, resigned from office after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge relating to his relationship with a 17-year-old receptionist, but promised to run as an independent in the special election. We’re two weeks into 2015 and Virginia politics is already having a rough year. [Washington Post]

73 percent of the Republican caucus

The Republican Study Committee, a conservative group of House Republicans, has seen substantial growth, with members accounting for 73 percent of the caucus in the 113th Congress, up from 7 percent in the 104th. Some conservative members, however, are reportedly planning an exodus to found another conservative caucus. [National Journal]


89 fires
Ohio State University fans tore down a goalpost and set 89 fires, mostly trash fires, after their team’s 42-20 win Monday in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Police responded with tear gas when fans tried to break their way into the stadium. [Baltimore Sun]

500,000 offspring
Antonio Cromartie is at it again!  A bull named Toystory who sired 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries died last Thanksgiving. He holds the record for most units of semen sold, about 2.4 million, and at his peak he was making about nine deposits a week. [Wall Street Journal]

$2.3 million
Sale price of a penny at a Florida auction. The penny was pretty old, and rather rare, so I suppose the decision made sense at the time. Still, even if you had a penny that was scientifically proven to make the owner more lucky, $2.3 million still feels like a really big ask, you know? [Smithsonian Magazine]

16 million 3-by-5 cards
The size of the most comprehensive repository of American English, maintained at Merriam-Webster’s headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts. The records — which are made out of archaic, fibrous data storage system known as “paper” — are said to be fireproof, like a cloud-based backup would also be. [Slate]

238 days
A premiere date has been set for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” The former Comedy Central host will have his first show on CBS on Sept. 8. David Letterman is set to sign off on May 20. There are 238 days from Tuesday to the preordained date of the return of the king. [Mashable]

1/100th of a millimeter
Seattle Seahawks fans are a notoriously loud bunch. Their stomping and jumping at CenturyLink Field lit up a nearby seismometer in 2011, shaking the sensor about 1/100th of a millimeter. Geologists this year outfitted the stadium with monitoring sensors to directly measure the effect, hoping to test new technology for monitoring earthquakes. I personally hope they’re finally able to find the geological impact of thousands of people simultaneously jumping on a bandwagon. [Wired]

10.5 percent
Fast-casual restaurants — the Shake Shacks and Chipotles of America — are coming off a banner year, with combined sales rising 10.5 percent last year. Fast-food chains saw only a 6.1 percent rise. One reason fast casual outpaces fast food: The former restaurants typically get 40 percent more out of each diner’s wallet than the latter. [The Economist]

20 percent
Percent of India’s 40 million construction workers who are women. They’re paid less than their male coworkers and are exposed to safety hazards and sexual harassment. [Reuters]

316 minutes
A Boeing 777-200 jet made the flight from New York to London in a mere 5 hours, 16 minutes, an hour and a half ahead of schedule. The flight benefited from a surging jet stream between the cities, and while hardly a record — the Concorde could make the journey in 2 hours, 53 minutes — the time is a vast boost over a typical crossing. [The Telegraph]


2,287 tickets
Summonses in the City of New York were down 92 percent in the week ending Jan. 4 compared to a year ago. There were 29,434 summonses and 5,370 arrests in the same week last year and only 2,287 summonses and 1,820 arrests this year. While the evidence points to a police enforcement slowdown, my alternative theory is that New Yorkers are just really good at keeping their new year’s resolutions to stop doing crimes. [New York Times]

The number of new autos that hit the street in 2014, the highest since 2006. December 2014 sales were up 10.8 percent over December 2013. Reasons cited include an economy bouncing back, cheaper gas, higher consumer confidence and cheap leases. [New York Times]

It’s 2015, which means that we’re in for a miserable year of people pointing out that the plot of “Back to the Future Part 2” is supposed to play out come October.

Following decades of declining marriage rates, the share of never-married Americans is at an all-time high; 23 percent of men and 17 percent of women over 25 have never been married. That’s 42 million people who still have the joys of explicit monogamy to look forward to. [Pew Research Center]


$52 million
Auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s are returning to the practice of guaranteeing sellers a price, which would require the auction houses to pay out in the event of an unimpressive sale. Sotheby’s lost $52 million in a single season in late 2008, after guaranteeing prices to sellers. [The New York Times]

CORRECTION (Jan. 9, 11:05 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the uninsured rate among U.S. adults decreased 17.1 percent from a year ago. It is down from last year’s rate of 17.1 percent.

1.4 percent decrease
A study by the Boston University School of Public Health found that a 1 percent increase of beer, wine, and liquor prices through taxes correlated to a 1.4 percent decrease in binge-drinking adults. Wyoming has the lowest beer excise tax in the United States, at a mere 2 cents per gallon, and Tennessee the highest, at $1.17. [The New Republic]

13 teams
The New York Knicks are a dumpster fire. They’re the worst thing to happen to Madison Square Garden since “Godzilla” (1998). Overhydrated toddlers study their game tape to figure out new and innovative ways to wet the bed. They’re terrible. So terrible that not only is almost every team in the NBA certainly superior to them, but the benches of 13 NBA teams are probably better than them too. [FiveThirtyEight]

22 people
In the past week, New York City police officers have appeared to sit back and ignore minor transgressions, seemingly reflecting a conflict between the city’s police department and Mayor Bill de Blasio. In a week one year ago, about 1,400 people were arrested or ticketed for jumping a turnstile in the Subway. This past week, only 22 people were. [The New York Times]

25 megabits per second
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is looking to substantially increase the definition of broadband internet — currently set at 4 megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads, 1 Mbps for uploads — to 25 Mbps downstream, 3 Mbps upstream. The definition was last changed in 2010, when “broadband” meant one-20th of what it does today. [Ars Technica]

37 percent decrease
Samsung had a tough year — its operating profit fell about 37 percent in the quarter ending December 2014 compared to the quarter ending December 2013. It’s the fifth consecutive quarter of decline for the world’s top smartphone maker. [The New York Times]

219 years
Age of a time capsule opened Tuesday in Boston. The capsule was placed by Paul Revere and then-Gov. Samuel Adams. Get excited, history buffs: artifacts conservator Pam Hatchfield identified some of the box’s contents as “newspapers,” which as I understand it were fiber-based products developed by people of yore to distribute their blogs. [Boston.com]

796 deaths
According to preliminary BLS data, that’s the number of deaths from construction work in 2013. Latino workers — who are more likely to be undocumented or work for smaller employers — are at increasing risk. [Buzzfeed]

1,200 potential jurors
In order to assemble a jury to try alleged Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. summoned 1,200 potential jurors to find 12 — 8 jurors and 4 alternates — who are qualified to serve. Selecting a panel that can evaluate the case without allowing personal bias may prove difficult. [The Boston Globe]

28,000 tons
Mass of expanded polystyrene — plastic foam — that New York City collected in a year. Beginning on July 1, food establishments in the city will be barred from using such containers. If the new ban is anything like the city’s smoking laws, there will be a ton of pushback to begin with, people will probably stop complaining about it after a while, gradually the policy will expand across the country, and 10 years from now the most dedicated New Yorkers will just take a bus to Virginia every four months to buy their take-out food containers in bulk. [The New York Times]

$100 million valuation

Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison for public corruption. Still, this was considered a win by McDonnell’s attorneys; the sentence is substantially shorter than the 10-year, one-month minimum sought by prosecutors. [NPR]

$10
Cost of a raffle ticket at the Vatican City Post Office, where you can win some of the Pope’s stuff. NBC News reported that Pope Francis is raffling off many of the gifts he has received from world leaders and the faithful. Proceeds will go toward the poor, and a $10 ticket could score you, reportedly, prizes ranging from a four-wheel drive Fiat, an espresso machine, a very nice hat or any one of dozens of other gifts people tried to give the Pope.

164 percent increase
The United States Coast Guard is worried that the defrosting of U.S.-Cuba relations has kicked off an unintended spike in migration from Cuba to the U.S., as Cubans worry the “wet-foot dry-foot” policy, which gives preferential treatments to Cuban immigrants who make it onto American soil, will end soon. Coast Guard interceptions of Cubans attempting to boat to the U.S. were up 164 percent in the second half of December compared to the first half of the month. [NBC News]

470 lightyears
Distance to Kepler 438b, a planet discovered by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Researchers say it may be the most Earth-like planet outside the solar system found so far. By “Earth-like,” scientists essentially mean “probably rocky,” and “at the ideal distance from a star such that it is neither frozen solid nor on fire.” So don’t bust out the lifeboats quite yet. [The Guardian]

756 people
Number of employees of U.S. Steel that have been laid off. The move follows the idling of two plants that produce piping for oil and gas exploration. The company is coping with demand issues stemming from the recent plunge in oil prices and reduced incentives to drill new wells. [Wall Street Journal]

1,371 luxury cars
The Hoegh Osaka, a container ship that ran aground off the coast of England, may be forced to scrap its cargo, among which is $53 million worth of luxury cars. The ship is carrying one very expensive-sounding Rolls Royce Wraith, which I choose to believe is carrying on a torrid yet doomed romance with one of the Jaguars from steerage as the disaster unfolds. [Business Insider]

87 million euros
A study found soccer star Lionel Messi’s transfer value is 200 million euros, 87 million more than Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo. In fairness, the Argentinian is known to be impossible. [ESPN FC]

$68 billion
Estimated cost of the California high-speed rail project that first broke ground Tuesday in Fresno, according to experts. The line would connect San Francisco and Los Angeles. The project is due to be completed by 2028, a time at which I sort of assume we’ll already have that Hyperloop thing, or at least a SpaceX flight to Kepler 438b. [Los Angeles Times]

Morgan Stanley has fired an employee it says stole — and tried to sell — data on about 350,000 clients of the bank’s wealth management arm (about 10 percent of all the bank’s wealth management customers). The FBI is investigating. [New York Times]

98.7 percent of growth
The homes and communities built around cities during the postwar housing boom have hit the point where they’re beginning to deteriorate, becoming undesirable housing stock. This is threatening inner ring suburbs: 98.7 percent of U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2010 took place beyond a two-mile radius of a downtown center. Roughly 70 percent of the growth took place 15 miles or more away from downtown centers. [Belt Magazine]

I am willing to sell my old Walkman for a tenth of that, but be forewarned that the “No Strings Attached” CD by NSYNC has been stuck in there since 2001. [Gizmodo]

1,364 busted rumors
Gossip Cop, a rumor site with a high bar for whispers, kept track of each busted, debunked and corrected story published in gossip outlets in 2014. The site’s tally of 1,364 false rumors includes details about Robin Williams’s final hours, an alleged relationship of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman and the marriage of Channing Tatum. And yet, Gossip Cop has yet to debunk slanderous rumors about a FiveThirtyEight lifestyle writer’s relationship with Bat Boy. [Gossip Cop]

3,000 feet
Two climbers are attempting to complete what is considered the most difficult ascent in the world: the smooth, sheer face of the El Capitan peak in Yosemite National Park. [New York Times]

$15,000
Kyle Craven, who inspired the internet meme Bad Luck Brian, estimated that he has earned between $15,000 and $20,000 over three years from licensing deals and T-shirts. [Washington Post]

$5.2 million
Software in half of New York City taxi cabs caused riders to pay an additional $5.2 million in tips. Bloomberg Businessweek analyzed the distribution of tipping in cabs, and Ben Wellington noticed that tips of 21, 26 and 31 percent were oddly frequent. It turns out the cabs running payment software from Creative Mobile Technologies included tolls and taxes in the pre-tip amount, while the cabs running Verfone tech don’t. In fairness, getting ripped off by a cab at least once is practically a city institution. [I Quant NY]

345,169,134 links
Google was asked to remove 345,169,134 links from its search engine in 2014 by copyright holders with Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices, a 75 percent increase over 2013. This is the worst thing to happen to pirates since Parliament enacted the Offences at Sea Act of 1799. [TorrentFreak]

$2 billion
The Islamic State claimed it has an annual budget of $2 billion for 2015, and will enjoy a $250 million surplus. The group pays its fighters $400 per month. [International Business Times]

2 seconds
As automakers start adding tablets to vehicles, they’re trying to keep in mind a voluntary guideline from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Limit any single interaction with a car’s technology to two seconds or less. At 60 mph, a car travels 176 feet in 2 seconds (or about the time it takes to put Miley Cyrus on repeat). [New York Times]

75 percent
France’s two-year-old tax rate on the nation’s highest earners is set to expire at the end of the month. Earnings over 1 million euros — roughly $1.2 million — were taxed at a whopping 75 percent rate. I have been unable to get a picture of a smiling Grover Norquist in a beret out of my head. [Reuters]

76 Matthews
An analysis of IMDb data found a relative paucity of heroic characters named Matt or Matthew on TV and in movies. There were just 156 Matts and 76 Matthews, despite Matthew ranking in the top 5 male names in every year from 1981 to 2006. Other common names, such as Jack or David, are equally common in TV and film. But as a Walter, I urge Matts to stop whining. [Medium]

200 fundraisers
A former adviser to Mike Huckabee said the former Arkansas governor would have to do between 200 and 300 fundraisers to amass the estimated $150 million needed to win the GOP nomination for president in 2016. [The Washington Post]

7:52 CST
Jan. 4 is the busiest day for online dating websites, according to data from Match.com and Plenty of Fish, with yearly traffic peaking sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Match.com said the peak time for its traffic was 7:52 p.m. CST. [Quartz]

$2,500
Estimated cost of doing CrossFit for one year in Manhattan, compared to about $6,000 per year doing SoulCycle four times a week. On the other hand, my daily fitness routine, eating a wheel of brie while watching Netflix, only costs about $800 per year. [New York Magazine]

150,000 acres
Poppy cultivation has almost tripled in Myanmar since 2006, as farmers turn to producing the in-demand and portable crop over others, such as coffee, which can take three years to produce beans. Close to 150,000 acres are devoted to poppy production. [The New York Times]

$245,340
That’s the average cost for a middle-income family to raise a child born in 2013 until age 18. Education and child care have both become much more expensive. Still, as with most things in the United States, it’s cheaper-per-unit to buy in bulk — the average cost for each subsequent child decreases. [Vox]

$300,000
Average cost to produce an hourlong episode of a true-crime reenactment for the rapidly growing Investigation Discovery network. The pulpy shows — such as “Momsters: When Moms Go Bad” and “Wives With Knives” — are cheap to make, with scripts ripped from the headlines, allowing the network to crank out 700 hours of original content per year. [New York Times]

$9.69 billion
Movies released in 2014 made $9,690,909,381, according to Box Office Mojo, the lowest haul since 2011. [Box Office Mojo]

13 years in prison
The sentence for a wealthy real estate developer convicted in China of buying and eating 3 tigers. The man was also fined 1.55 million yuan (almost $250,000). Trafficking has decimated the tiger population, which has dropped from about 100,000 a century ago to 3,000 today. [The Straits Times]

19 accidents
The number of plane crashes in 2014, according to the Aviation Safety Network. The count, which is below the 10-year average, looks at incidents with 14 people or more, and disregards two crashes — Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine, and the AirAsia crash this past weekend. Air safety statistics are varied and often disagree. [The Verge]

28 detainees
Five Guantanamo Bay detainees were released to Kazakhstan, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. This year, 28 detainees have been transferred to other countries, including Uruguay and Afghanistan, the largest number since 2009. There are still 127 detainees who remain in the prison. [New York Times]

50 percent of films
An analysis found that 15 of 30 animated releases by DreamWorks Pictures were “fueled by hyperactive talking animals.” Thanks to the hacking of Sony Pictures, the poor performance of DreamWorks in 2014 mostly went unremarked upon in the media. The studio had a rough year, with two major releases failing to meeting box office expectations. [The Daily Dot]

51 percent of devices
Apple won Christmas, representing 51 percent of device activations in the week leading up to Dec. 25. The company’s success may be buoyed by the rising share of “phablets,” or phones the size of small tablets, such as the iPhone 6 Plus. Phablets exploded in popularity this Christmas, tripling their share of activations compared to last year. More people activated a phablet than activated full-sized or small tablets. [Quartz]

58 percent
The market share for Internet Explorer. Microsoft is reportedly working on a new browser, code named Spartan, to be offered when Windows 10 is released. Internet Explorer has a 2 percent market share on mobile. Call your parents (or grandparents) and alert them that other browsers exist. Together, we can make a better internet in 2015. [Wired]{

60 percent
In a typical year, the flu vaccine is effective at reducing diseases with flu-like symptoms by about 60 percent. But the CDC announced this season’s flu outbreak has not been typical, reaching epidemic levels. The vaccine’s effectiveness this year may be about 40 percent. Widespread cases are not yet reported in New York, but in any event I urge you to please refrain from licking the handrails on the subway for the time being. [CBS News, via @theZorb]

126 officers
In 2014, 126 law enforcement officers were killed on duty, compared to 102 in 2013. [New York Times]

2:15 a.m.
That’s when George Stephanopoulos wakes up every day to host Good Morning America, one of many morning talk show hosts to greet the day just as this writer is about to crash. Savannah Guthrie of “The Today Show” wakes up at 3 a.m., and co-anchor Matt Lauer is up by 4 a.m.. [New York Times]

$1 billion
That’s how much oil tycoon Harold Hamm was ordered last month to pay his ex-wife following the largest divorce settlement in U.S. history. Hamm’s $19 billion fortune has fallen by half after an oil price crash, and he’s since appealed the ruling. Hamm holds a 68 percent stake in Continental Resources, the top driller in the North Dakota’s oil boom. This is why I personally don’t invest in volatile commodities like oil, and instead invest in online shopping, Seamless orders and late night saki. [Reuters]

3 years of rent
The 26-year-old English singer Jessie J reported she was able to live comfortably for more than three years on the earnings from writing a single song, Miley Cyrus’s 2009 hit “Party In The USA.” [ET]

34 percent of parents
According to a survey conducted by Netflix, 87 percent of parents are spending New Year’s Eve with their children. And 34 percent of parents plan to fool their children into thinking it’s the new year before the clock actually strikes midnight. Netflix intends to aid in this temporal façade, with a lemur-themed countdown parents can stream at any point in the evening. [CNN]

$299
Attention masochists! For a mere $299, you can spend your New Year’s Eve in the Times Square TGI Fridays. Amenities include appetizers, a dinner buffet and an open bar of TGI Friday’s specialty drinks. [Gothamist]

4,900 tons of burning money
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve is tasked with getting rid of old paper bills that are too worn out. My sensible solution — place the unusable bills by vending machines on K Street in Washington in an effort to cut down on lobbying — has yet to gain traction. Instead, the Fed has invented a way to recycle the discarded bills into energy by sending them to local power plants to be burned for electricity. [Gizmodo]

7,842 deaths
The World Health Organization announced that the Ebola outbreak has killed more than 7,842 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. At the moment, though, most people are focused on a single case in Scotland. [Turkish Press]

$11,000 processing fee
The fee to obtain a vanity address in the City of New York, which allows developers to choose a luxury address for their new buildings — for instance, the forthcoming “432 Park Ave” located on 56th street. A Park Avenue address is worth 5 to 10 percent more than a comparable apartment on an adjacent side street, because real estate makes no sense in this godforsaken city. I never thought it would be possible to make a grid system complicated. [Bloomberg Businessweek]

58,913
The number of homeless people in New York City, a record high. [WNYC]

$24 million
Placing a lot trust in an organization notorious for dropping players who have passed maximum efficiency, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady restructured his contract to give the franchise $24 million back to spend during the off-season. Brady can now be released at any time without any liability. [ESPN]

30 million unauthorized downloads
“Frozen” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” top the list of most-pirated films of the past year, with 30 million downloads by torrent users. The fact that the top five illegally downloaded films of 2014 were all released in 2013 is — if anything — a grim reminder of how terrible most movies were this year. [Variety]

$82.5 million
Revenue in fiscal year ending December 2013 for rapidly expanding burger chain Shake Shack, which filed for an initial public offering Monday. The chain has 63 restaurants according to the report, one of which essentially turned New York’s Madison Square Park into an elaborate line that would haunt the most hardened DMV veteran’s nightmares. [Business Insider]

$1.39
The fee self-published authors received in November for one digital “borrow” of their book on Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited. The all-you-can-read service, which costs $9.99 per month, has reportedly hurt writers who rely on the e-commerce giant for income. For standard ebook sales, Amazon typically gives writers 70 percent of a book’s earnings. [New York Times]

50 minute drive
How far a Twitter user drove on Christmas to get into an offline fight with another Twitter user over Kobe Bryant. Because one party in the argument was remotely rational, the fight did not occur. [SB Nation]

440 letters of support
Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who was convicted on public corruption charges in September, has amassed 440 letters of support from former colleagues, friends and family members seeking leniency at his Jan. 6 sentencing. McDonnell could face more than ten years in prison, but his attorneys — and supporters — are hoping for a community service sentence. In one letter, McDonnell’s daughter Caitlin blamed the crimes that led to her father’s downfall on her mother. [Washington Post]

510 pardons
California Gov. Jerry Brown announced 105 pardons on Christmas Day, mostly for people convicted of minor drug offenses. Brown has given out 510 pardons since he took office in 2011. The three governors who preceded him in office granted a combined 29 pardons over 20 years. [Los Angeles Times]

1,175 civilians
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that in the past six months the Islamic State has killed 1,175 civilians. In addition, the group has killed 120 of its own members, mostly foreign fighters seeking to return home. [Al Jazeera]

1,434 Wal-Marts
Minimum wage hikes in 21 states will affect base salaries at roughly one-third of Wal-Mart’s stores. Employees in South Dakota will see the biggest jump, as the state raised the minimum 17 percent to $8.50 per hour. I’m going to assume this means I can once again shop at Wal-Mart guilt-free. [Reuters]

58,000 college students
That’s the estimate from Free Application for Federal Student Aid data for the number of homeless college students in the United States during the 2012-2013 academic year. [The Huffington Post]

$15 million
How much “The Interview,” which was released on video-on-demand streaming services Tuesday afternoon, made through Saturday. The film also earned $2.8 million in 300 theaters. The film — in which the guys from “Pineapple Express” try to kill North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un — was downloaded more than 2 million times. The budget for the film was about $40 million, so hopefully Sony has learned the valuable lesson about fronting money to potheads that the rest of us learned in college. [Variety, Huffington Post]

$48 million, 6 years
The rumored contract Jim Harbaugh, who just parted ways with the San Francisco 49ers, will sign to coach the University of Michigan football team. If confirmed, the contract would make Harbaugh the highest-paid college football coach in the country. It’s unclear when Harbaugh will go to Michigan, but — knowing San Franciscans — I can say it’s entirely dependent on when Uber surge pricing ends. [Bleacher Report]

$179,227,702,248
Starting with $1,000 on Jan. 1, that’s how much money someone would have had by Dec. 23 if they had played the stock market perfectly in 2014. Granted, this kind of performance is infinitesimally unlikely — basically alternate-timeline Biff Tannen levels of financial decision-making — but assuming an investor picked the best performing stock of the S&P 500 each day, they could’ve become the richest person on earth in mid-December. Better luck next year. [Quartz]

2 percent
The FDA announced plans to lift its lifetime ban on blood donation from men who have had sex with other men. It will soon propose replacing the ban with a subsequent ban on blood from men who have had sex with men within a year of donating. The change could increase the U.S. blood supply by 2 percent. [The Washington Post]


9 players
Number of Denver Broncos players selected for the Pro Bowl, the most of any team. Peyton Manning, who has fewer Super Bowl victories than his brother Eli, was selected for the Pro Bowl for the 14th time. Meanwhile, each one of the triumphant New York Giants were exempted from this burdensome game, giving Odell Beckham Jr. ample time to practice without distraction. Go Giants. [ESPN]


10.8 months
The average employee tenure at a startup company, compared to 17.5 months at a non-startup company. More than half of the employees at analyzed startups — which are defined as venture capital-funded companies less than 10 years old — are younger than 30 years old. [Quartz]


39 college bowl games
This year will see a record 39 college bowl games. I’d like to elaborate more here, but I went to The College of William & Mary and was born after 1970 so I’ve never had reason to know what a college bowl game is. [FiveThirtyEight]


57 percent of Cuban-Americans
Percent born in Cuba, compared to 68 percent in 2000. The shifting composition of Cuban-Americans could be one reason why a majority of Cuban-Americans opposed the U.S. embargo policy. [Pew Research Center]


61 school districts
Number of Mississippi school districts with open desegregation orders, the highest of any state in the nation. Some U.S. districts are required to increase the integration of black and Latino students, and some districts have had those orders open since the 1950s. [ProPublica]


100 percent
An analysis of 21 “best movies of 2014” lists found that every one of them had director Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” on the list. [FiveThirtyEight]


2,000 jobs
As part of a plan to cut $3 billion from its budget, Coca-Cola intends to cut up to 2,000 jobs globally. It’s the largest cut at the company in 15 years. [Business Insider]


1 million medical tourists
The South Korean government is expecting a substantial increase in medical tourism, an industry which is dominated by plastic surgery. Last year South Korea had 211,218 medical tourists, and the nation expects 1 million per year by 2020. [The New York Times]


6.6 million coffee machines
Keurig Green Mountain is recalling upwards of 6.6 million Mini Plus Brewing Systems that can apparently overheat and spray water during brewing. They’ve received around 90 reports of burn-related injuries so far. [NBC News]

5 years old
The peak age for belief in Santa Claus, according to University of Texas psychologist Jacqueline Woolley, with just over 80 percent of five-year-olds trusting in St. Nick. [The Atlantic]

27 percent of U.S. electricity
Following New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision last week to ban hydraulic fracking, the safety of natural gas is once again in the spotlight. Natural gas is currently responsible for 27 percent of U.S. electricity generation, and the number is rising in part because of fracking projects. Some environmentalists are concerned. [The New York Times]

40 percent of Americans
Federal guidelines indicate that 1.5 ounces of nuts per day is linked to a reduced risk of heart attack, but the CDC reported that only 40 percent of adults ate nuts on a given day, with older people eating substantially more nuts than younger people. I’m taking this news to heart, and from now on will eat Nutella like it’s yogurt. [Washington Post]

51 percent approval
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the NYPD don’t share many supporters. While both the mayor and the police department enjoyed 47 percent and 51 percent job approval ratings, respectively, individual subgroups — by borough or race — suggest the support is inverse. De Blasio’s “tale of two cities” campaign slogan still holds true. [FiveThirtyEight]

81 percent
That’s the percent of non-Christians who celebrate the holiday of Christmas. Among nonbelievers — those who describe themselves as atheist, agnostic, or “nothing in particular” — 87 percent celebrate the holiday. [Pew Research Center]

1,024 official IP adresses
North Korea lost access to the internet yesterday for about ten hours, inconveniencing a handful of people.

850,000 kids
The estimate for the number of children who visited a Santa Claus in the post-Thanksgiving weekend, according to International Council of Shopping Centers trade group. Of people who went to the mall to see Santa, 70 percent reported they would also do some shopping. [Bloomberg News]

Victims of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme are set to receive a new round of payouts totaling $322 million, bringing the total restitution to around $7.2 billion. That’s about half of the lost principal. [Bloomberg News]

$7.5 billion
When the Castro regime nationalized the assets of foreign companies operating within Cuban borders in 1959, American companies filed claims worth $1.9 billion with the U.S. government’s Foreign Claims Settlement Division. Those claims are worth upwards of $7.5 billion today and are no doubt on companies’ radars now that the U.S. and Cuba are defrosting. [Talking Points Memo]

11 days in the wild
The amount of time a family of three — Steven Van Lonkhuyzen and his two sons, aged 7 and 5 — survived while lost in an Australian National Park. Someone on a motorcycle found them when they had only a few slices of bread left. [The Guardian]

14 confrontations
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has engaged in at least 14 raised-voice confrontations with regular people since 2010, usually at town hall meetings. Aides said the governor has held 127 town halls across the state, so if we assume for a second that all of them happened at town halls, it puts the odds of a confrontation breaking out at roughly 11 percent. That’s a threat level somewhere between a guy cutting you off on the Turnpike and a Jets home win. [The Washington Post]

15 percent of marriages
There’s been a huge jump in multiracial marriages recently, which make up 15 percent of recent unions. In 2010, that number was 8.4 percent; in 1960, 0.4 percent. [Brookings Institute]

In China, the village of Yiwu is responsible for manufacturing 60 percent of the world’s Christmas decorations. The 600 factories produce everything from plastic snowflakes to the felt Santa hats adorning our drunkest SantaCon attendees. [The Guardian]

$27.5 million
Following allegations that the company over-billed the U.S. government, Lockheed Martin will pay the feds $27.5 million. The defense contractor is said to have overcharged the feds for work performed by people who were unqualified. A lesser column would seize this opportunity to make a joke about Congress. [Reuters]

Welcome to the fourth edition of Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.
2.5 times as likely to die
Main characters in children’s cartoons were 2.5 times as likely to die as the main characters of films aimed at adults, a study found. They were also three times as likely to be murdered, and parents in particular were five times as likely to die in animated films. I look forward to the second season of “Serial” trying to exonerate Roger Rabbit in the murder of Marvin Acme. [UCL]

13 hours
Amount of time a New Zealand couple was reportedly stuck in their car. The pair did not realize that they could exit the Mazda 3, as it featured keyless entry and they didn’t have their transmitter. [The New Zealand Herald]

“25 to 30 percent”
That’s Russian President Vladimir Putin’s estimate for how much of Russia’s economic difficulties are because of U.S.-led sanctions. [The Washington Post]

27.7 percent
That’s the average obesity rate of U.S. workers. The occupation group with the highest rate — 40.7 percent — was police officers, firefighters and security guards. [The Wall Street Journal]

47 percent increase
Desktop search queries on Amazon increased 47 percent between September 2013 and September 2014, which could be bad news for Google. Commercial searches make up 20 percent of queries on the search engine, and losing market share to direct searches on Amazon could hurt the company’s largest business. [Business Insider]

$2,500 worth of prison calls
That’s the estimate for how much Sarah Koenig’s Serial podcast might have spent talking with Adnan Syed in the Maryland correctional facility. The top rate for telephone calls to prisons in 2013 was 89 cents per minute, plus a charge of $3.95 per call. [Bloomberg Businessweek]

1.6 million mishandled bags
In the first nine months of 2014, 1.6 million reports of mishandled baggage were sent by airlines to the Department of Transportation. The biggest offender was Envoy Air, a subsidiary of American Airlines, which had about 9 complaints per 1,000 passengers. [The Washington Post]

3.5 million fewer Justin Bieber fans
In what’s being referred to as the “Instagram Rapture,” the photo sharing company is cracking down and deleting spam accounts. As a result, some celebrities are seeing their follower counts fall by the millions. Bieber’s follower count dropped by 3.5 million, and rapper Ma$e reportedly lost so many followers — dropping from 1.6 million fans to a mere 100,000 in 20 minutes — that he has deleted his account entirely. [Business Insider]

$20 million
How much billionaire investor Carl Icahn has said he would spend to keep the bankrupt Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City open. Talks to avert the Saturday closing have fallen apart between the investor and the casino workers’ union. [The Philadelphia Inquirer]

(409)-935-XXXX
That’s the (deliberately obscured) number of a Texas City, Texas plumber who has been inundated with phone calls after a photo of one of his company’s former vehicles hit the internet. The truck, which says “Mark-1 Plumbing” on the side along with the phone number, now has an anti-aircraft gun in the bed and is allegedly being used by Islamic State militants. The plumber says he has no idea how the vehicle ended up in Syria. [Galveston Daily News]

Welcome to the third edition of Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. We’re experimenting with it, so let us know what you think.
1 percent of iPhones
That’s the Russian share of iPhones sold worldwide in 2013, 1.57 million of 153.4 million total. It’s not much overall, but currency fluctuations prompted Apple to suspend online sales in Russia. [Wired]

6.6 times the median
The median net worth of upper-income families is 6.6 times greater than the median wealth of middle-income families. That’s the widest gap in 30 years. [Pew Research Center]

$35 per month
AMC theaters — seemingly inspired by Netflix, Hulu Plus and The Olive Garden — is testing a subscription service called MoviePass. It will allow people who pay $35 per month to see one movie per day. If it’s similar to HBO Go at all, I plan to use my roommate’s ex-girlfriend’s parents’ MoviePass for the foreseeable future. [Denver Post]

93 percent discount
Nine works of art stolen six years ago were recovered by the LAPD. Despite the art being worth about $10 million, the person who had it was trying to sell it for $700,000. That’s a bargain that should stoke any serious collector’s FOMO. [Los Angeles Times]

37,924 wannabe lawyers
Law school enrollment has sunk to its lowest total since 1973. There are 37,924 full- and part-time law students starting classes in 2014, a 30 percent drop from the 52,488 enrollees in 2010. [The New York Times]

5 million kids

$75 million settlement
A federal judge rejected a $75 million class-action settlement for NCAA athletes who suffer from debilitating effects of head injuries. Both sides will now have to find new terms they can agree upon that will also satisfy the judge. [Associated Press]

100 million cups of coffee per year
Royal Dutch Shell sold 100 million cups of joe at its gas stations last year. As oil prices decline, Shell plans to expand its station network, in part so it can better peddle the other kind of fuel. [Bloomberg News]

Welcome to the second edition of Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. We’re experimenting with it, so let us know what you think.
0.09 bitcoin
Time magazine announced that it would begin to accept payment for subscriptions in the digital currency bitcoin. A one year, $30 print subscription would cost about 0.09 BTC based on yesterday’s prices. It’s always touching when two volatile and uncertain business models find each other. [The New York Times]


15 percent of the vote
That’s the percentage of Republican voters who would back former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in a presidential primary if former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney doesn’t run. Bush leads a Romney-less field, and yesterday announced his intention to form an exploratory committee to look into running for the presidency. [The Washington Post]


26 percent good news
The nation’s perception of its job situation appears to be improving: 26 percent of Americans reported hearing good news about jobs compared to 25 percent who heard bad news. That’s the first time good news beat bad news in five years. [Pew Research Center]


90 days of free mail
Just one of many perks enjoyed by former members of the U.S. Congress. In addition to being entitled to taxpayer-funded mail (through something called the “franking privilege,”), former House members can continue to use the parking lot, the member’s dining room and the gym, albeit the latter has a fee. [The Washington Post]


294 mistakenly accepted freshman
Johns Hopkins University mistakenly told 294 applicants they were accepted to the prestigious university when they had actually been denied. The cringeworthy error places Hopkins in good company: Fordham University, Vassar College and The University of California at San Diego have all erroneously admitted students in the last few years. [The Washington Post]


$550 less on gasoline
The average U.S. household is expected to spend $1,962 on gasoline next year, about $550 less than this year. That forecast is the lowest level in 11 years. [U.S. Energy Information Administration]


1,000 tons of frozen french fries
McDonalds is running out of french fries in Japan due to labor disputes at U.S. ports, leading to rationing and size limits beginning Wednesday. McDonalds has taken emergency measures and airlifted 1,000 tons of fries in, with a subsequent plan to ship over another 1,600 tons in January. Please keep the people of Japan in your thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. [The Washington Post]


7,000 body cameras
Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced a plan to purchase 7,000 body cameras for the LAPD, enough for most of the department’s 9,900 officers. [Los Angeles Times]


$10,000 starting bid
That’s the starting bid for one of the Army’s 4,000 surplus Humvees, which are on sale to the general public starting Wednesday. It’s an exceptional choice if you were disgusted by the earlier item about Americans saving $550 on gasoline next year. [Jalopnik]


925 million gallons
Forecasted consumption of orange juice this fiscal year, the lowest since at least 1996 and the eighth decline in 10 years. [Bloomberg News]

Editor’s note: This is the first edition of Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. We’re experimenting with it, so let us know what you think.
1.66 cents
Cost to produce one penny, according to the U.S. Mint. While coin costs are falling, nickels also come in over face value, costing 8.09 cents to produce. That’s more than the 5.4 cent cost of printing a dollar bill. [Washington Post]

17 percent
The Central Bank of Russia announced a major rate hike yesterday, raising the main deposit rate from 10.5 percent to 17 percent. The country relies substantially on oil revenues, and the recent drop in the price of crude hasn’t helped the economy, which is seeing low growth and high inflation. [New York Times]

30 percent of the planet’s natural gas
The North Pole has been claimed by Denmark, and with it the vast gas reserves locked up beneath the Arctic sea bed. Denmark — the small European nation that lucked into Greenland a while back — competes with Canada, Russia, Norway and the U.S. over the Arctic, which has an estimated 15 percent of the planet’s remaining oil and 30 percent of its natural gas reserves. [Business Insider]

$49 per pound
Cost of handmade Vermont butter that just went on sale at Saxelby Cheesemongers. Until now, Animal Farm butter was served almost exclusively at restaurants Per Se and The French Laundry, and now you, too, can buy a pound of it with all your leftover milk money. [Grub Street]

65 percent of U.S. adults
A majority of Americans believe the biblical Christmas story (as Pew puts it, “the virgin birth, the journey of the magi, the angel’s announcement to the shepherds and the manger story”) reflects historical events. Among Christians, the number of believers is over 80 percent. [Pew Center]

88 percent of Los Angeles’s water
LA gets almost 90 percent of its water from three aqueducts. These three aqueducts — which sustain 22 million Southern Californians — cross the San Andreas fault 32 times. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti thinks this may be a problem. [LA Times]

150,000 tourists
In 2012, the story of a botched restoration of a Spanish church’s fresco of Jesus went viral. In the intervening years since the retouching, the town of Borgia has seen a renaissance of tourism. The image has attracted 150,000 tourists to the small city, and visitors can pay one euro to glimpse the simian portrait. [New York Times]

10 million dead oysters
Ostreid herpesvirus-1, an oyster herpes virus that can have a 100 percent mortality rate, is sweeping the seas, putting the $4 billion shellfish industry at risk. The virus killed 10 million Australian oysters in a mere three days. [Bloomberg]

$72 million in fake money
This week, New York magazine reported that a high school senior made $72 million investing in the stock market while still in school. Now he’s come clean and admitted he hasn’t made a dime. [New York Observer]

$349 million
Cost of a NASA laboratory tower designed to test a new rocket engine. The rocket it was designed for was canceled in 2010, and the facility is now mothballed. Space, it turns out, is expensive. [Washington Post]
CORRECTION (Dec. 19, 5:43 p.m.): An item in this article originally misidentified The French Laundry as a restaurant in New York. It is located in Yountville, California.

36th president
John Bailey, a cinematographer who worked on “The Big Chill” and “American Gigolo,” was voted to become the 36th president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Oscars. [Variety]

53 percent
Percent of owner-occupied homes owned by people 55 and older. Baby boomers are holding on to their homes longer and are crowding out others from the market, namely younger Americans trying to own their first property. That figure was only 43 percent a decade ago. Certainly nothing could go wrong in an intergenerational housing fight where one side is holding out for a ridiculously expensive cash-out that the other side can likely never offer. [Bloomberg]

84 percent drop
Chinese capital buying up offshore real estate has been a financial trend in major world cities since 2013. But it’s projected to crash this year. Due to a stronger yuan and domestic initiatives that need funding, Morgan Stanley estimates an 84 percent drop in Chinese overseas direct property investments. [Bloomberg Gadfly]

109 cases
A salmonella outbreak traced back to a southern Mexico papaya farm has sickened at least 109 people in 16 states. [ABC News]

785 touchdowns
Number of touchdown passes last year that were thrown from the right arm of a passer. For a little context, last year there were … 786 total touchdown passes. The left-handed TD pass was on a trick play. This dearth of lefty passers is weird. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.021 trillion
Current outstanding revolving debt in the U.S., which you can basically think of as “credit card debt” for all intents and purposes. This is a new record, beating out $1.02 trillion in April 2008. Around that time nothing whatsoever notable occurred in the economy, as far as I can recall. [MarketWatch]

10 weeks
Monday night Rachel Lindsay of The Bachelorette arrived at the end of her 10-week journey and selected Bryan Abasolo as the winner of the competition. Abasolo was also the recipient of the show’s prized first impression rose; 17 percent of those who had received it in past seasons went on to win the competition. Abasolo’s victory only improves that rose’s predictive power. [FiveThirtyEight]

36 percent
Percentage of respondents to a CNN/SSRS poll who said they consider the first 200 days of President Trump’s presidency a success. Fifty-nine percent considered the first 200 days a failure. The first 200 days of President George W. Bush and President Obama saw success assessments of 56 percent and 51 percent, respectively. [CNN]

52 seats
Republicans do not need to win any swing states in order to achieve a Senate majority, given that there are 52 Senate seats in states where they beat the national presidential vote by a margin of five points or more. This imbalanced landscape is a recent phenomenon. In 1980, there were 18 states where the presidential margin was 5 points or more in favor of Democrats, and 18 states where it was 5 points or more in favor of Republicans. [FiveThirtyEight]

76 percent
76 percent of SAG-AFTRA members who voted on a new labor contract supported a new deal that gives actors improved residuals on digital streaming platform products. [Variety]

$489 million
It appears financial crime enforcement is down, judging by fines assessed. The Wall Street Journal looked at the aggregate penalties laid down by the SEC, CFTC and FIRA in the first half of 2017 and the amount — $489 million — is down substantially from last year, when $1.4 billion in fines were assessed in the same period.

There have been at least nine applications for trademarks incorporating racially charged words and symbols filed since a June 19 Supreme Court ruling that tossed out a federal law prohibiting them. Most of those are related to the N-word. [Reuters]

36.2 days
Median amount of time a U.S. state could run government operations with their 2016 levels of money reserves. This is down from 2007’s mark of 41.3 days, and 2017 could see the median decline to 27.5 days of rainy-day fund runway. [Pew Charitable Trusts]

$37 in gross profit
Middlemen called pharmacy-benefit managers hugely profit from the sale of brand name drugs. According to a consulting group, a brand-name drug with a $300 list price may deliver $37 to third parties, with pharmacy-benefit managers getting $18 of it. [The Wall Street Journal]

32,000
The subways in New York City are in a state of dire disrepair after decades of governors ignored or deferred maintenance on the system. Now mayor Bill de Blasio is suggesting the city increase the upper-most tax rate by about a half-point to generate $800 million a year to fix the subways. There are about 32,000 New Yorkers who are either single individuals who make more than $500,000 per year or part of a married couple who make more than $1,000,000 annually. Their city tax rate would go from 3.9 percent to 4.4 percent. [Bloomberg]

$10 million
Just when he was finally getting out, Jay Cutler keeps being pulled back into the NFL. With the Dolphins confronting the loss of their starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill to knee surgery, the ex-Bears quarterback and recent Fox Sports hire signed a $10 million one-year deal with Miami. [ESPN]

Number of farms in China with cropland, compared to 1.6 million in the United States. That abundance of small suppliers means that China is particularly vulnerable to food fraud, for instance when lower-quality meats are passed off as the real deal. This has led to some serious tech solutions to confront the problem. [Bloomberg]

65 – 68 degrees
Nighttime thermostat wars? It happens to the best of us. At first, it’s civil. Then it escalates. Before you know it, you’re digging through the drawer looking for duct tape to lock that temperature in place. So let’s settle this now: Room temps between 65 and 68 degrees are best for sleep. Match those temperature settings with a mattress that keeps you cool and you’ll be well on your way to getting some high quality Z’s. Sponsored by Casper

Kraft Heinz, now managed by the renowned cost-cutters at 3G Capital, is trying to reinvent its Oscar Meyer hot dogs for a more health-conscious consumer. The reinvention might bring a 6 percent sales jump, according to the company’s market research, and they’re spending $10 million to build the new hot dogs. [Bloomberg]

36.5 opioid deaths
A new study is casting doubt on previous research suggesting that rising mortality rates among middle-aged white men is largely attributable to “deaths of despair.” Rather, the new study in the International Journal of Epidemiology suggests that metabolic diseases such as obesity and opioid addiction (which has seen drug related deaths jump from 1.4 deaths per 100,000 men in 1980 to 36.5 deaths per 100,000 men in 2014) are among the key factors.

Pret A Manger, a sandwich shop with chains in several East Coast cities including New York, was hit with a $5.5 million class action lawsuit on Monday. Yee Ting Lau, a Pret A Manger customer, argues in the lawsuit that the company misleads its customers as to the real size of its sandwiches. As Gothamist wrote, “The shroud of deception, according to the suit, is a seemingly harmless cardboard casing — ‘lovingly handmade throughout the day,’ it reads — positioned in a way that obscures the actual size of the packaged wrap.” As a man whose primary motivations in life are “hunger” and “pettiness,” this is essentially the most important legal case of my lifetime.

That’s the year construction got started on the still incomplete Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea. The impressive and potentially structurally unstable 105-story building in the North Korean capital was unveiled with new renovations last week. The structure was also sporting a new sign: “Rocket Power Nation.” Perhaps Kim Jong Un’s regime has finally caught on to “Rocket Power,” the hit Nickelodeon action-games cartoon that inspired a generation of extreme sports lovers.

Box office gross for Sony’s “The Emoji Movie” in its debut weekend — a disappointment that landed the film behind “Dunkirk” in its second weekend. But hey, at least Sony can cash in by merchandising the public-domain world of unicode characters. You can ride that 💰 🐄 into the sunset.

$20.54 billion
Netflix is rapidly trying to build up the kind of enduring catalog of content that can yield dividends for years to come. But to get there, the streaming service is borrowing lots of money — to develop its own original content and to pay for the back catalogs that other people built. As a result, the company has racked up an immense amount of debt, some $4.8 billion in long-term debt and $15.7 billion in short-term obligations. There’s nothing inherently bad about this — subscribers are consistently up and Netflix has to spend money to make money — but there’s the potential that the debt becomes a monkey on the company’s back if the business climate changes.

$6,000 per year
Every summer, lots of New York City rich people go to the Hamptons on Long Island. They are obviously the target demographic for all sorts of ridiculous luxury products, and one way to get such products out there is through the seemingly endless free magazines that target the area’s summer residents. This has presented a legitimate issue for the cities: The sheer mass of magazines being disposed of has led to at least one sanitation worker injury. The basic cost of disposing of the magazines is approximately $6,000 per year for Southampton Village. [27 East]

1.7 million pounds of dirt
Two new vacuums operating in the New York City subway system have hauled out 1.7 million pounds of dirt and detritus from the E, F and A lines since the beginning of the year. Since the trash clean-up effort began, the number of trash fires dropped from 75 in January to 53 in June. [The New York Times]

$78.5 billion
Estimated cost of prescription opioid abuse in 2013, according to a federal study. That doesn’t incorporate costs of lost productivity experienced by employers who are having trouble staffing up, with some reporting that as many as a quarter of applicants can’t pass a drug test.

Cost of the Yara Birkeland, an autonomous electric ship under development and bound for the seas in 2018. That’s about three times the up-front cost of a standard ship of its size, but since it doesn’t need fuel or a crew, operating costs are as much as 90 percent lower than normal.

It’s summer, and how we use energy to cool our homes is of paramount interest to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. All told, 87 percent of homes use air conditioning, and 65 percent of homes use central air conditioning. Now here’s where things get interesting: Most of those central air homes have a programmable thermostat, an essential tool for efficiently using energy. Still, two-thirds of those homes with a programmable thermostat don’t bother using it. All told, the percentage of U.S. homes that have central air, have a thermostat that can program the use of that central air, and actually use the thermostat — ideal energy consumers — represent only 12 percent of homes. [EIA]

45 percent
Percentage of Trump voters who believed that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer during the election, which is very low given that Donald Trump Jr. personally tweeted out the emails detailing the planning of the meeting, discussed attending the meeting at length in an interview with Sean Hannity, and also that the president discussed the meeting which definitely happened, in print yesterday.

74 percent
Placebos work, and faking a surgery may be the greatest placebo of all. A 2014 knee pain study comparing elective surgical procedures and sham surgeries — fear not it was all on the level people knew what they were potentially getting into — found that faking a surgery (doing all the fasting and knocking them out and fake incisions and the whole routine) provided some benefit to the ailment in 74 percent of cases and was just as effective as the actual elective surgery roughly half the time. [FiveThirtyEight]

A CBO score of the latest GOP bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act found it would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 compared to current law. This straight repeal, no replace legislation compounds the uninsured more than other recent plans and could see a vote next week. [CNN Money]

$216 million
Back in March the New York Power Authority was reportedly presented with a preliminary plan from the Cuomo administration that would fund a light show on a bunch of bridges by raiding $216 million from the MTA. Now that New York City is bordering on open rebellion with the wretched state of the MTA’s subway system during the “summer of hell,” the Cuomo administration is reportedly distancing itself from the light-show plan.

Thailand’s tourism business is booming, but the nation is trying to find out how to get tourism spending up without boosting the raw number of visitors, which this year will number 35 million foreign tourists. Namely, the nation wants their tourists to act more Australian, meaning staying longer and spending more money every day compared to their, say, English counterparts. [Bloomberg]

In 2009, $2.5 billion in subprime auto bonds were sold, a figure that jumped to $26 billion in 2016. Delinquency on paying auto loans is up as well, at 3.82 percent of automotive loans 90 days delinquent or more. Sound familiar to anyone? [Bloomberg]

Juicero is a start up that seeks to bring fresh pressed juice to the masses. Before January, the company priced each juice pack at about $5 to $7 and the juice pressing machine at $699, before later dropping to $399. Here’s the issue though: a Bloomberg investigation found that you could just use your hands to squeeze the juice out of the packs rather than paying for the hardware. Based on my own estimates, more people have hands than $399 to drop on a fancy juice pressing machine. Juicero announced last week they’re laying off 25 percent of their staff and will drop the price of their still superfluous press to the $200 price range. [Fortune]

$200,000s to the $500,000s
Range of 2017 sale prices for New York City Taxi medallions. Those are the valuable licenses that allow yellow cabs to operate, and they have historically been a solid investment for owners. Three years ago, those medallions were selling for as much as $1.3 million, but the arrival of Uber and Lyft have taken a massive bite out of their value. Now, this has had major secondary effects. There are credit unions that allowed medallion owners to take out lines of credit using the medallion as collateral. As a result of the collapse in value, enough medallion owners are now underwater that three New York lenders have been placed into conservatorship. [CNBC]

Percentage of respondents to an AP/NORC poll who said wealthy people had too much power and influence on what happens in Washington. Other groups that a majority of respondents said had too much power: large businesses, political lobbyists and Wall Street. Now, 75 percent of respondents said people like them didn’t have enough power in Washington, which is fine, but who I’m really interested in is the 3 percent of respondents who said that people like them had too much power in Washington. The notion that about 1 in 33 Americans is like, “screw this, my friends and I shouldn’t have this much control over the future of the country” is a level of either impostor syndrome or moral clarity that I find immensely entertaining.
