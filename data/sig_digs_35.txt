12 officers shot, 5 killed
At least one gunman shot 12 police officers, killing five, in Dallas on Thursday night. Two civilians were also wounded. The attack occurred during a demonstration against recent police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. This story is still developing, so there’s still a lot we don’t know. [Dallas Morning News]

$2
Cost of a typical roadside drug test kit used by police departments. Namely, is that white powder you’re packing baking soda or blow? Well, it turns out that these cheap drug tests have some pretty significant problems with false positives. One study found 33 percent of cocaine field tests in Las Vegas between 2010 and 2013 were false positives. According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, 21 percent of substances identified by the police as methamphetamine were not methamphetamine. [ProPublica]

12 percent
Nielsen is out with a report on how the music industry did in the first six months of 2016. The company tracked 208.9 billion music streams, including audio and video, which is up 58.7 percent over the same period in 2015. Still, the remnants of a bygone era of music aren’t going away quietly: Sales of vinyl LPs accounted for 12 percent of “physical business” in the first six months of 2016, up from 9 percent last year. [Nielsen]

14 percent
Percent of people who trust the news information they get from friends, families and acquaintances “a lot,” compared to 18 percent who place a similar level of trust in national news organizations. Nobody trusts what they read on Facebook, though: Only 4 percent of web users trusted news from social media “a lot.” [Pew Research Center]

41 GOP senators
Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, went to Capitol Hill yesterday. More than 200 Republican House members showed up to a meeting with Trump, but a separate meeting with the nominal GOP standard-bearer was attended by just 41 of the 54 Republican senators. Only 30 senators entered the meeting through the front door, where the media’s cameras were rolling. While we don’t know exactly what went down in these meetings, early reports include a number of hilarious altercations between Trump and the “Establishment.” [Politico]

74 percent
Percentage of registered voters who said that “it really matters who wins the election,” according to a Pew Research Center study. That’s the largest percentage Pew has found in any presidential election cycle going back to 2000, when only half of respondents agreed. The study also found that a higher percentage of people think about the election and follow news about the election than in any presidential year since 1992. [Pew Research Center]

UPDATE (July 8, 5:48 p.m.): This article has been updated to reflect new information about the Dallas attack, including a new casualty count from the Dallas mayor, Mike Rawlings, who said Friday that seven law enforcement officers were wounded, along with two civilians, in addition to the five officers who were killed..

6.2 percent
Global growth in same-store sales at McDonald’s in the first quarter, a win that has led the company to — buckle up, people — expand all-day breakfast options even more. As a person who has very little self-control/self-respect and a profound love of breakfast burritos, this is incredible news for me. [Bloomberg]

21 months
A Spanish court sentenced soccer star Lionel Messi to 21 months in prison for tax fraud. Neither he nor his father, who received a similar sentence, is expected to spend any time behind bars; as the BBC put it, “under the Spanish system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.” [BBC]

26 percent
Of about 350 major companies and institutions, Google was the largest consumer of renewable electricity, accounting for 26 percent of long-term renewable electricity contracts, according to a Bloomberg study of corporate power-purchase agreements. The Pentagon is No. 2 on the list, reflecting a commitment by the U.S. military to gradually go green. The tech industry alone bought 1.78 gigawatts of renewable power in 2015, which seems like more than enough to toss a DeLorean back to the Reagan era. [Bloomberg]

81 percent
Mondelez International, a global food conglomerate, is trying to buy the Hershey Company. But Hershey is a weird company: 81 percent of the chocolatier’s voting shares are controlled by the Hershey Trust Company, which funds charitable ventures. And the attorney general in Pennsylvania — where Hershey has an absurdly big economic footprint — also gets to approve or veto any transaction. So, to score the acquisition, Mondelez has to persuade the Hershey board, the Hershey foundation and a politician, which is one reason that Hershey has managed to go stag to the prom of food industry consolidation for so long. [The New York Times, TheStreet]

8,400 troops
There are about 10,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan right now. President Obama planned, as recently as 2014, to have only 1,000 members of the U.S. military there when he left office. In late 2015, he revised that up to 5,500. He announced on Wednesday, though, that about 8,400 troops will remain in Afghanistan through the end of his presidency. For some context, the U.S. has been in Afghanistan since I was 11 years old. I have a 401(k) now. [FiveThirtyEight, The Atlantic]

2.6 million words
A U.K. report released Wednesday looking into the nation’s involvement in the Iraq War found that the military invasion was not a “last resort” and that there was not a coherent reconstruction plan before the invasion. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement after the release of the report — which came in at roughly 2.6 million words — taking full responsibility for mistakes made by the U.K. [Quartz]

18 years old
Vashti Cunningham will help represent the U.S. in the high jump at the Rio Olympics. At just 18 years old, she’s the youngest U.S. track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics since 1980. [Excelle Sports]

50 years
The Freedom of Information Act has turned 50. President Lyndon Johnson signed the open-records law, allowing anyone to request federal government documents with a mere letter. [The Washington Post]

110 emails in 52 chains
James Comey, the director of the FBI, released details on Tuesday of his department’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The FBI found 110 messages in 52 email chains that contained classified information, but no criminal charges were recommended. [Digg]

300 pounds
A 61-year-old Canadian man, Rick Nelson, survived an attack by a 300-pound mother black bear after coming across the bear’s cub while walking his dog. Nelson punched the mama bear in the face (twice). “Most bears are right-handed,” Nelson, a former bear hunter, said. I’m really just going to trust him on this one. [CBC]

31 million routers
Close your eyes and think of a wireless router. You are probably thinking of the Linksys WRT54GL router. You know, the blue one with two antennae that came out in 2005. Shockingly, this antiquated bit of George W. Bush-era tech is still a good seller for Linksys, pulling in multi-million dollar sales each year. They’re cheap, they stack, and they’re apparently durable. The WRT54G line of routers has sold 31 million units in the past 14 years. [Ars Technica]

264 billion barrels
Estimated recoverable oil reserves in the U.S., more than half of which is locked up in shale oil, according to Rystad Energy. That’s a higher figure than Russia or Saudi Arabia. [Bloomberg]

28 months
That’s how long the House select committee’s investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attacks lasted, exceeding the amount of time high-profile congressional committees spent digging into Watergate, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Sept. 11 attacks and Pearl Harbor. [AJC]

37 orbits
NASA’s Juno probe traveled through our solar system for nearly five years and arrived Monday at its destination: Jupiter. It will spend about 18 months carrying out 37 orbits to figure out the gas giant’s deal. [NBC News]

Between 64 and 116 civilians
Number of civilians that have been inadvertently killed during the U.S. drone and air war against terror suspects in “non-war zones,” according to the Obama administration. Watchdog groups place that figure higher. [The Washington Post]

70 hot dogs
Joey Chestnut won this year’s Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest after eating 70 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Last week, I looked at the evolution of that competition and how it transformed from a charming contest in which people consumed a lot of hot dogs into an event where victory is ensured only by a self-imposed 10-minute meat-and-bread waterboarding session. [ESPN, FiveThirtyEight]

440 death sentences
Just five prosecutors are responsible for putting a huge chunk of people on death row in the U.S. over the last several decades, a Harvard Law School investigation found. These five head prosecutors (only one is still in office) put 440 people on death row. Keep in mind: There have only been 8,038 death sentences since the reinstatement of the death penalty 40 years ago. [The Guardian]

20,000 pounds of cheese
Crime of the century in Wisconsin: 20,000 pounds of cheese from U.S. Foods, en route from Green Bay to New York, was stolen. Anyone with information is encouraged to call me. [The Associated Press]

Percentage of married households in which spouses have different political views. One-third of those households involve a Democrat married to a Republican. [FiveThirtyEight]

31 songs
Of the 128 songs to hit the Top 40 this year, 31 were performed by women, 22 by groups of men and women, and the rest were performed by men. [Fusion]

33 films
Of the top-50 grossing films of 2016, only 33 of them have passed the so-called Bechdel-Wallace test, which a film passes when it has two named female characters who have a conversation that is not about a man. That’s better than normal, but still a long way to go. [Fusion]

2000
That’s the year Adnan Syed, the subject of the blockbuster “Serial” podcast, was convicted for killing his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison. Maryland has granted him a retrial. [The New York Times]

$90,000
About 80,000 bottles of beer worth roughly $90,000 were stolen last week. This is bad, but it gets worse. Even though the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Southeastern Transportation Security Council recovered 30 of the 40 stolen pallets, the booze will have to be thrown away, because life is suffering. [The Associated Press]

$650 million
Religious exemptions to property taxes in New York City add up: Over $650 million worth, roughly 1 percent of the city budget, are exempted from taxation, $476 million of which is for houses of worship. [iQuantNY]

3 films
Originally, there was going to be a single film based on the tedious 1980s video game “Tetris,” for the usual, terrible reasons a studio would make a movie based on ’80s nostalgia and geometry puzzles. For new, inexplicable reasons, that idea has now been expanded to a trilogy of films based on the intellectual property, because why the hell not. A Tetris cinematic universe is exactly what we as a society deserve. [Empire Online]

19 titles
The Marine Corps will change 19 official job titles such as “infantryman” to a gender neutral alternative, dropping the “man” part. Infantryman will be changing to “basic infantry Marine,” for instance. It does sound catchier? [The Washington Post]

19.3 percent
The FiveThirtyEight election forecast dropped yesterday! Based on the data in our polls-only forecast, Donald Trump has a 19.3 percent chance of becoming the President of the United States. [FiveThirtyEight]

99.8 percent
Percentage of Iceland’s television audience that watched Iceland defeat England in the UEFA EURO 2016 tournament. That makes the O.J. chase look like CSPAN. [Deadspin]

683
Number of people admitted to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the folks who vote on the Oscars. It’s the first stage of a huge push by the organization to increase its level of diversity: 41 percent of the Class of 2016 were people of color, and nearly half were women. [The AV Club]

$25.8 million
Amount spent by the Hillary Clinton campaign and its allies in television advertisements in battleground states during the month of June. The Trump campaign and its allies spent $0 during the same time period. When looking at past and reserved air time in battleground states, Team Clinton’s spent $140 million and Team Trump has spent, er, $0.00. [NBC News]

41 killed
A terrorist attack at Turkey’s Ataturk airport has claimed at least 41 lives. Three gunmen loaded with suicide vests attacked the terminal, fired upon travelers, clashed with police, and eventually detonated their suicide bombs. Two of the gunmen detonated their bombs within the terminal and one in the parking lot. The death toll is expected to rise to as high as 50. [BBC]

230 injured
The Turkish justice minister said that 230 people were injured as well. This is far from the first act of terror this year on Turkish soil: Just this past March, 37 were killed by a car bomb in Ankara. [BBC]

11th busiest
The Ataturk Airport in Istanbul is the 11th busiest airport on the planet, with 61.8 million passengers passing through there last year. [Yahoo]

6.44 percent
Turkey’s tourism industry has seen visits from foreigners drop substantially as the region destabilizes. January 2016 tourism was down 6.44 percent year over year. [The Telegraph]

8 percent
Further damage to tourism would be especially harmful, as 8 percent of Turkey’s workforce are employed directly in the tourism business. [BBC]

0
Number of attackers able to get past the first security check, in part due to the courageous actions of the police in the airport. From a design perspective — compared to the American system of a single security check leading to a massive line full of unscreened individuals — Turkey’s airports have a security check at the entrance of the buildings and a subsequent checkpoint before the departure gate.

Days after voters decided the U.K. will leave the European Unions, ratings agencies have reacted to the move.

Average amount of time the average American adult spent watching live television per day in the first quarter of 2016 according to Nielsen. That jumps to 5 hours, 4 minutes if you add in DVR viewing. [Recode]

5-3
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that Texas laws requiring abortion clinics to meet the standards of “ambulatory surgical centers” and that their doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital constituted an undue burden. From 1970 through 2014, abortion and contraceptive related decisions overall tended to come out in favor of the conservative-leaning party. [FiveThirtyEight]

A further $2 billion will go toward research on technology to reduce emissions with another $2.7 billion goes to “environmental mitigation.” [The Associated Press]

Barnes & Noble is testing out selling booze in its bookstores at four concept locations around the country.

The Mac n’ Cheetos hits select Burger King locations today. They cost $2.49, have 310 calories in a serving, and are basically a mozzarella stick, only instead of the cheese it’s macaroni and cheese, and instead of the breading it’s Cheeto dust, and instead of the marinara sauce it’s ranch dressing seasoned with irrevocable loss of self-regard.

H.B. 1547
New Hampshire called into question its status as the “live free or die” state Friday when Gov. Maggie Hassan signed H.B. 1547, a bill finally banning sex with animals. Bestiality is still somehow legal in nine states and D.C., bringing up the question of who on earth is lobbying for it and why are they this powerful? Moreover, the press release calls sex with animals “disturbing and prevalent issue” in New Hampshire: Precisely how prevalent is it to warrant that level of alarm? [The Humane Society]

You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news. Britain has voted to exit the European Union, a news event so transformational that it’s taking over Significant Digits. Your regularly-scheduled, topically-omnivorous Significant Digits resumes Monday.

51.9 percent
With 100 percent of voting areas reporting, 51.9 percent of U.K. voters have cast their ballot to leave the European Union. 17.4 million people were in favor of leaving, and 16.1 million were in favor of remaining in the EU. [The Wall Street Journal]

2 years
Now the U.K. will initiate Article 50 of the EU treaty in order to secede, which gives them two years to negotiate an exit. [Bloomberg]

$1.50
The vote has lead to a nearly instantaneous devaluing of the pound. On Thursday, at the market’s most bullish moment, one pound could buy about 1.50 American dollars. Once it became clear that the U.K. was going to leave, its value dropped swiftly. At its nadir 1 pound could buy about 1.32 dollars. That’s the lowest it’s been since at least 1985. [CNBC]

44 percent
The EU is the U.K.’s largest trading partner, and 44 percent of the country’s exports go to the EU. Because of the results of the referendum, there’s now uncertainty around what a new trade deal will look like between the two bodies, and whatever the result is could be bad news for the U.K.’s economy. [Bloomberg]

A few months
Who will negotiate those trade deals? Who knows, as Prime Minister David Cameron’s coming days in office are numbered. The architect and ostensible leader of the opposition to the referendum said he will resign before the end of October. [The Guardian]

32 of 32 council areas
In leaving the EU, the U.K. may ultimately break itself up. Remember 2014, when Scotland decided to stay in the U.K. during its own referendum? Well, it also wanted to stay in the EU: Every one of its council areas voted to remain in Thursday’s vote. After the vote, Scotland’s first minister said that Scotland sees its future in the EU, and that a new Scottish independence vote is “highly likely.” [Business Insider]

€1.2 billion
That’s the amount of weekly trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, trade that was facilitated by both nations’ being in the EU. Brexit was forecast to reduce the GDP of Ireland by 1.2 percent according to the Irish Minister of Finance. In the medium term, trade between the two nations could drop by 20 percent. The cabinet of Ireland will have an emergency meeting to discuss what comes next. [The Irish Times]
