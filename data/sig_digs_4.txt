10 Kennedy interruptions
Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered the likely swing vote on a case about extreme partisan gerrymandering, asked 5 questions and made 5 statements to the Wisconsin attorneys and 0 of either to Democrats who want the partisan maps struck down. This is considered a good sign for the Democrats, as justices are statistically more likely to take the side of a petitioner they don’t pepper with questions. [FiveThirtyEight]

34 unicorns
That’s the number of new billion-dollar-valued startups (or “unicorns”) in China since mid-2015, compared to 39 in the U.S. over the same period. China is catching up to Silicon Valley when it comes to churning out expensive and jacked-up companies that are worth lots of money on paper. [Quartz]

54-point gap
Guns are about the most divisive issue in America. A Pew Research Center poll found 22 percent of Democrats chose protecting gun ownership rights over limiting access to guns, compared to 76 percent of Republicans. That staggering 54-point gap makes abortion look like an issue with a minor divide, same-sex marriage look like a mild discussion point and marijuana legalization look essentially unanimous. [FiveThirtyEight]

78 earthquakes
Number of earthquakes caused by a seismic swarm in Yellowstone National Park in September, down from 894 in August, 425 in July and 1,028 in June. Earthquake swarms are nothing to be hugely worried about — and part of me thinks this may just be viral marketing for that “Geostorm” movie coming out this fall — but now all that’s left to do is wait for scientists to analyze the data left behind. [Gizmodo]

20,093 shots
That’s the score obtained by Adam Rolston on a golf hole that’s a 2,011-kilometer, 82-day trek across Mongolia. I want to believe par is 20,092 shots and he’ll have to take the bogey. [The Guardian]

70,000 ng/kg
Measured level of dioxin in areas near the 14-acre San Jacinto Waste Pits in Texas following Hurricane Harvey. Generally, 30 ng/kg is enough for the EPA to recommend a cleanup. The hurricane appears to have spread toxic sludge. [Houston Press]

CORRECTION (Oct. 6, 5:16 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described the number of earthquakes in Yellowstone National Park. The figures given for September, August, July and June were for earthquakes caused by a seismic swarm, not earthquakes overall.

CORRECTION (Oct. 6, 11:05 a.m.): An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a poll question. Respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of Trump’s comments calling on NFL owners to fire the players and on fans to boycott games, not just his comments urging a boycott.

Given the catastrophic news from the Las Vegas strip, we’re going to hone in on that today. 
Check out the full 2016 FiveThirtyEight investigation “Gun Deaths in America” here. 

527 injured
At least 59 people are dead and 527 people injured, some critically, by the high-powered gunfire that indiscriminately targeted a crowd of country music fans Sunday night from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. [ABC News]

90 shots in 10 seconds
According to a New York Times analysis of the videos, that’s the shot frequency observed in Las Vegas, which can be compared to the 24 shots in 9 seconds observed in the Orlando attack on a gay night club, where 49 people were killed and 53 were wounded in 2016, and to the 98 shots in 7 seconds that a fully automatic rifle can provide. [The New York Times]

273
Based on the definition that a mass shooting involves four or more people shot, the shooting in Las Vegas is the 273rd of the year. Only 275 days have gone by in 2017 so far. [Fortune]

42 guns
That’s the number of guns owned by the killer found either in the hotel room or at his home. There were 23 in the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino and 19 in his home in Mesquite, NV. In addition, a number of loaded high-capacity magazines were found in his hotel room. Some of the weapons are believed capable of penetrating police armor. The haul included a number of AR-15-style firearms. [ABC News]

64 years old
Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock was 64 years old when he went on his rampage Sunday before killing himself, according to authorities. That makes him among the oldest perpetrator of an attack like this since the mid-sixties. [The Washington Post]

At least 50 dead
More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded by a gunman who opened fire on thousands of concert-goers on the Las Vegas strip on Sunday night. The massacre is already being referred to as the most deadly mass shooting in recent American history, and the death toll is only expected to rise. [NPR]

8 minutes
O.J. Simpson is once again a free man. He was released at 12:08 a.m. Sunday from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, eight minutes after he became eligible for parole. O.J. Simpson was incarcerated for nine years following a botched robbery in Las Vegas. [The Los Angeles Times]

25.6 percent
Despite only accounting for 16 percent of the population, Catalonia — a region of Spain seeking independence — produced 20.1 percent of Spanish GDP in 2015 and 25.6 percent of exports in 2016. The Spanish government cracked down on an attempt to hold a referendum regarding secession. [POLITICO]

45 kilograms
Four men were indicted Friday in New Jersey after their arrest in June for possessing 45 kilograms of fentanyl, the highly potent drug believed to be driving much of the increase in opiate fatalities. For perspective, 45 kilograms of fentanyl is enough for 18 million lethal doses. [NJ.com]

74 percent
Percentage of New York City subway commuters late to work because of problems riding the rails this past summer, according to a survey referenced in a report from city Comptroller Scott Stringer.

More than 8.9 million children
The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which funds low-cost heath insurance for more than 8.9 million children whose family incomes come in just above Medicaid qualification, is set to expire. The uninsured rate for children fell from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 4.5 percent in 2015 under the program, and funding will run out at the end of the month. [ABC News]

$291.2 million

Percentage of legal marijuana users who ate at Taco Bell in the preceding four weeks, according to an industry study from Green Market Report and Consumer Research Around Cannabis. Forty-three percent ate at McDonald’s. [Bloomberg]

60 percent
Pivoting to video as a news site strategy sure seems like a great way to pivot to people not using your website at all: comScore data indicates that publishers that fired a bunch of writers this summer to fuel quixotic and nebulous video ambitions saw at least a 60 percent drop in traffic in August compared to August 2016. [Columbia Journalism Review]

112 TWTR points
Introducing Nate Silver’s “Trump Weekly Twitter Rage” point system. Step No. 1: Add one point for every insult made by the president from @realDonaldTrump, according to The Upshot, in the preceding seven days. Step No. 2: Add one point for every exclamation point contained in a Trump tweet in the preceding seven days. Step No. 3: That’s it, actually. The index maxed out on July 29 after a GOP health care bill failed in dramatic fashion. [FiveThirtyEight]

60,000 independent workers

11 hospitals
Reeling from Hurricane Maria’s devastating effects, Puerto Rico is edging toward crisis. Only 11 of the U.S. territory’s 69 hospitals had fuel and power as of Tuesday. The issue prompted the rapper Pitbull to send his plane to fly chemotherapy patients to the mainland U.S. for treatment. [CNN]

12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent
The new GOP tax plan would condense the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven (the current setup) down to three. The marginal tax rates — now 10 percent up to 39.6 percent — would be 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, but Republicans have yet to detail which incomes would be taxed at which rates. [The New York Times]

538 yards
Going into Week 4 of the NFL season, rookie running back Kareem Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs has 401 rushing yards in his first three games. That’s more than 26 of the 32 teams in the league.

5 animals, 12 crops
Here’s something that’s only mildly unsettling: three-quarters of the food for people on Earth comes from only five animal species and 12 crops. This seems like an issue, given that we’re one major disease, famine or blight away from losing a major component of our food. [The Guardian]

13 percent
Puerto Rico is in crisis, and the Jones Act, a law that costs an estimated billions of dollars annually to Puerto Rico, is not helping. The Jones Act requires foreign vessels bringing goods to the island to either pay high taxes and tariffs to unload there, or to take a detour to the mainland before an American ship takes the goods to Puerto Rico. This ensures Puerto Rican cost of living is 13 percent higher than other urban areas in the U.S. [The New York Times]

23 players
A Boston University study published yesterday compared the brains of 23 former football players known to suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, 50 patients who did not play football but did have Alzheimer’s disease, and 18 control brains. The study found elevated levels of one protein only in the brains of ex-players with CTE. This may open the door to a CTE test that can be conducted on living patients. [The Washington Post]

Roy Moore, a former judge who was twice removed from office, has beaten Sen. Luther Strange in a runoff to win the GOP Senate primary in Alabama. This is a blow to establishment Republicans and the President, who backed Strange. [CNN, FiveThirtyEight]

280 characters
Twitter has decided to go through with it and finally torpedo the thing that makes their product tolerable: The company is testing a doubling of the maximum length of a tweet. Lucky beta testers will get 280 characters, so users will have twice as many opportunities to sabotage their reputation. [The New York Times]

Percentage of Americans who want to decrease taxes for the wealthy. Sixteen percent of Americans want to cut taxes for corporations. The majority of Americans — according to a Wall Street Journal poll — instead want to increase the taxes paid by corporations and the wealthy.

62 signatories
Number of Roman Catholic scholars and clergy who signed a 25-page “filial correction” letter accusing the pope of spreading heresy when he published “The Joy of Love.” That document was viewed by some in the faith as reaching out to divorced and remarried Catholics. The Catholic Church has a long history of handling grievances from concerned clergy without issue, right? [The Associated Press]

$20,000 to $50,000
Lawyers are pricey, especially D.C. lawyers. As special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian electoral interference expands, more and more people who were associated with the Trump campaign are feeling the financial pinch. Just lawyering up to help prepare for congressional testimony could set someone back $20,000 to $50,000 in fees, and a grand jury subpoena for a witness could lead to legal fees in excess of $100,000.

Aaron Hernandez, a former NFL tight end who killed himself in prison while serving a life sentence for murder, suffered a severe form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., researchers say. He died at 27 — and having not played football for several years — but nonetheless had stage 3 C.T.E (there are four stages). [ESPN]
