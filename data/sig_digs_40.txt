Welcome to Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.

5 states
Hillary Clinton won four of the five states in contention yesterday — Rhode Island went to Sanders — and widened her lead by about 50 delegates. On the GOP side, Donald Trump had a stellar evening, winning each of the five states — Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island — and scooping up the vast majority of the delegates on the board. [FiveThirtyEight]

156 nerds
My colleagues Ben Lindbergh and Rob Arthur reckon that there are 156 people employed by Major League Baseball clubs as quantitative analysts, up from 44 in 2009 and 75 in 2012. [FiveThirtyEight]

650,000 albums
Prince does not appear to have left a will, meaning his sister and five half-siblings may be the heirs to his estate, an estate that’s likely to have revenue coming in for some time. Since his death last Thursday, at least 650,000 albums and 2.8 million tracks have been sold. [The New York Times]

10.7 million viewers
Reported viewership for Sunday’s season six premiere of “Game of Thrones,” of whom 7.94 million were viewers who watched the show live on TV. [CNN Money]

£29 million
Cost of repairs for Big Ben, which is definitely a clock in England and not a quarterback in Pittsburgh who is paying hush money over a marijuana incident, as I thought when I first glanced at the headline “Big Ben ‘bongs’ to be silenced for £29m.” The repairs will mean Ben’s iconic bell will temporarily go quiet until everything’s refurbished. [BBC]

$150 million
The amount of Islamic State cash that the U.S.-led coalition destroyed in a bomb strike on a house in Mosul, Iraq. That strike was part of a larger strategy of targeting the terrorist group’s money depots. So far an estimated $500 million to $800 million has been destroyed by air strikes. [BBC]

9 square inches of skin
Are you a company interested in weird advertising strategies? Nick Symmonds, a runner who has appeared in two Olympic games, is auctioning off nine square inches of skin for advertisers to bid on. He’ll put a temporary tattoo of your logo on his flesh at racing events this year — though he will have to cover it up during actual races because of what he calls “antiquated rules.” During a previous auction for part of his body, he got $11,100 from an advertiser. [Ebay]

72 times
Number of times Donald Trump has been personally sued in federal court since 2000. Since 2000, Bloomberg found that Trump and his companies have either sued or been sued at least 1,300 times. [Bloomberg]

172 delegates
Number of delegates up for grabs in Republican primaries in Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut tonight. Donald Trump has 95 percent of his current delegate target based on a FiveThirtyEight analysis, and his target tonight is 97 of the 172 delegates available. Ideally, he’ll want more, and he’s favored to win big in many of the states. FiveThirtyEight will be live blogging the results this evening, and if you’re looking to watch the returns live I’ll be on the ABC News live stream tonight repping the site, so by all means check that out. [FiveThirtyEight]

$324
According to a nationwide survey from Visa, that’s how much money the average household with teenagers spent last year on “promposing,” which is exactly what it sounds like. In my day, panicked proposals came during tech week for the musical, when there was a realization that prom was near, and even though you had an AP Latin exam the next morning you should ask a friend to go with you because at least the food was supposed to be good. [Bloomberg]

$3.26 million
Price sold at auction for the “Laws of Base Ball,” a series of documents written in 1856 by Daniel Lucius Adams. It’s believed that the documents represent the first time some modern rules of baseball were put to paper. [ESPN]

$4.25 million
The relatively small amount Texas spent to repave highway shoulders and widen a 6.3 mile section of State Highway 161 during rush hour. It’s early yet, but the project has been a smashing success so far, with traffic moving twice as fast as it was before. But this isn’t how it’s supposed to work — widening highways rarely improves congestion and can make it even worse. Transportation planners are trying to figure out what has gone right so far.

2.3 MB
The average webpage requires a user to download 2.3 megabytes of data, which is slightly less than the 2.39 megabyte size of the original “Doom” shooter video game. Webpages are getting bigger and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. If only there was some sort of way to get a stripped-down version of a website you read every day delivered right to your inbox. [Wired]

9-3-2-6-2-5
The Chicago White Sox pulled off an extended triple play Friday against the Texas Rangers. It involved the right fielder (a position represented by “9” in baseball parlance) catching the fly ball, tossing it to first (3) where a runner was tagged out, the ball going to the catcher (2), then the shortstop (6), then the catcher again (2) and finally the third baseman (5) who tagged another runner out. As the announcer said, “Bases loaded, bases cleaned.” [Deadspin]

20-point margin
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is far back in the delegate count and is running out of races where he can close that gap. As of now, he’ll have to win the remaining contests by a 20-point margin over Hillary Clinton to erase the deficit. With many delegates up for grabs on Tuesday as part of several East Coast states’ primaries, losses there could lead to a tactical shift in how the Sanders campaign talks about Clinton. [NPR]

28 pages
Amid mounting pressure, the White House is considering whether to declassify all or portions of a 28-page section of the 9/11 congressional inquiry that some think may detail a connection between Saudi Arabia and the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. [The Associated Press]

57 delegates
Number of Republican delegates at stake in Indiana. The Ted Cruz and John Kasich campaigns announced Sunday night — right after “Game of Thrones” no less — that Kasich would leave Indiana to Cruz and Cruz would let Kasich campaign unimpeded in Oregon and New Mexico, all to help stop Donald Trump. #NeverTrump has finally learned that campaigns can talk to each other, it would appear. [POLITICO]

79 percent
With Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut holding primaries tomorrow, we’ve got forecasts for the latter three states based on current polling. Donald Trump has a 79 percent chance of winning Maryland, an 89 percent chance of winning Connecticut and a 98 percent chance of winning Pennsylvania. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is a strong favorite in each of those three states. And as for Delaware and Rhode Island … have you considered inviting more people to your states to make yourselves more appealing to pollsters? [FiveThirtyEight]

0 female directors
Zero women are scheduled to direct films at 20th Century Fox and Paramount through 2018. TheWrap found that men are set to direct the next 22 scheduled films from Fox (TheWrap excluded the art-house studio Fox Searchlight) and 25 films from Paramount. [The Wrap]

1 female CEO
In 2015, 359 new chief executives were named at the top 2,500 companies globally, according to a new study by Strategy&. Of those 359 new CEO’s, 10 were women. And of the 87 new chief executives appointed in the U.S. and Canada from that group, only one — Andrea Greenberg, CEO of MSG Networks — was a woman. [The Washington Post]

16-0
Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs threw a no-hitter Thursday, leading the Cubs to a 16-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds were rather sanguine about the whole affair, all things considered. [ESPN]

56 percent
According to a new poll from SurveyMonkey, that’s the percentage of Americans who believe replacing Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill is the right call. [SurveyMonkey]

120 days
Amount of time Douglas Hughes, the Florida mailman who last year landed a gyrocopter onto the West Lawn of the Capitol Building to protest campaign finance laws, will spend in prison as a result of his guilty plea to America’s worst parking job ever. [POLITICO]

77.6 million
Number of Americans who live in ZIP codes where Amazon has begun to offer same day delivery. However, a Bloomberg analysis of census tracts and delivery zones found that black and other minority populations are underserved in some of the 27 metropolitan areas where Amazon offers the service.

The No. 2 pick
The Philadelphia Eagles, a team I despise, traded a whole bundle of draft picks to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for the No. 2 overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft and a fourth-round pick next year. The Browns got a first-, third- and fourth-round pick this year, a first-round pick in 2017, and a second-round pick in 2018. My hope, as a New York Giants fan, is that this is the first good trade in the history of the Cleveland Browns. [NJ.com]

4 days
All right, given that I both work for Disney and was born in 1990, I’m way too close to this story, so I’m just going to state the facts: The Disney Channel is planning to release the 100th Disney Channel Original Movie and will air a four-day marathon of the 51 most popular films in the franchise in May as part of the celebration. If you also consider the contemporary implications of “Motorcrossed” nearly monthly, feel free to reach out, and I’ll let you know more deets about the marathon. [Deadline]

$20
Do you use money? Same! Huge news out of the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday: Secretary Jack Lew announced that changes are coming to American currency. Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill (Jackson will appear on the reverse side), local Broadway star Alexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 bill, but he will be joined on the reverse side by Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Alice Paul. Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, will be joined on the $5 note by Martin Luther King Jr., Marian Anderson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Nothing will happen to Benjamin Franklin on the $100 bill, and I’m cool with that. [U.S. Treasury]

69 calls
New York City’s 311 service, which allows residents to file complaints that are slightly below 911-level emergencies and slightly above a letter to the editor, clocked 69 complaints from January 2010 to May 2015 regarding people smoking pot in city parks. The moral of Gawker’s analysis is that you should not smoke weed at the PS 14 Playground pool in Staten Island. I hope everyone made it out of 4/20 all right! [Gawker]

250 deaf attorneys
Approximate number of deaf attorneys in the United States, according to Teresa Curtin of the Weitz & Luxenberg law firm. Curtin was authorized to argue cases before the Supreme Court, along with 11 other deaf and hard-of-hearing lawyers, in a ceremony at the court Tuesday. [Reuters, h/t reader Brian Keller]

$12,500
A South Korean fried chicken restaurant going by “Louie Vuiton Dak” — a play on the Korean word for whole chicken — has been ordered to pay 14.5 million won ($12,500) to the luxury brand Louis Vuitton for damages. [Agence France-Presse]

0 delegates
Number of delegates Ted Cruz appears to have won in Tuesday’s New York Republican presidential primary, which mathematically eliminated him from winning a majority of pledged delegates before the convention. Cruz insulted New York values earlier in the campaign, apparently not knowing that one of those values is not caring about people from Texas or what they think about your values. Presumably Cruz will do whatever anyone does when they learn they can’t hack it in New York, which is check out Philly or put all their hopes on a win in California. [The Associated Press]

SCR 9 
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, doing the most Utah governor thing in the history of both governors and Utah, has signed SCR 9, a resolution declaring pornography a public health hazard. [CNN]

18 seconds
I got one of those new chip credit cards, and it’s a total nightmare. It takes credit card machines forever to read the card, and society hasn’t yet developed the conversational mores for chitchat with the cashier during the half-minute the busted-up card reader is judging me. But there is hope on the horizon: Visa is launching software that can cut up to 18 seconds off the transaction time. I really wish I could go back to the swipe card because I don’t really need the extra security — that’s a problem for people with enough money where having a credit card stolen would be a cause for concern rather than a way for a thief to quickly overdraft at a Taco Bell. [The Wall Street Journal]

27 years old
UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor announced in a tweet Tuesday that he will retire early. It’s not certain if that means the 27-year-old’s retirement is effective immediately or if he’s just making a public declaration of his career ambition. [The Guardian]

60 percent
Percentage of the New York GOP vote that went to Donald Trump, handing the native New Yorker a decisive and much-needed win and nearly all of the delegates New York has to offer. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won the state’s primary by 16 percentage points. [ABC News]

$27,500
Maximum civil penalty for flying a plane with no registration. This is of particular concern to Donald Trump, who has been flying in a jet owned by an LLC he controls with a registration that lapsed Jan. 31. [The New York Times]

30 percent
The Islamic State’s monthly revenue is down almost 30 percent compared to a year ago, mostly due to U.S.-led air strikes on its petroleum-generating resources and lost territory. For some perspective: Blockbuster’s annual revenue dropped by 21 percent from FY 2009 to 2010, and look how many Blockbuster stores we have now. [Bloomberg]

54 percent
Based on FiveThirtyEight’s polls-plus forecast, that’s Donald Trump’s average projected share of the vote in the New York primary today. He’s a greater than 99-percent favorite to win. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is also a 99-percent favorite; she averages 56 percent of the vote in our projections. Check out Harry Enten’s district-by-district guide to the GOP primary in New York. Also check back here tonight for our live blog following the results. Myself, I’ll be appearing on ABC News’ live stream starting at 6 p.m. — so if you want to hear FiveThirtyEight’s election coverage in my voice, tune in. [FiveThirtyEight]

80 unlocks
Average number of times per day a user unlocks their iPhone, according to Apple. [The Verge]

5,100 acceptances
It’s that time of year again, when some college or university sends out a galling number of accidental acceptance letters. This year’s colossal screwup comes to us from the The State University of New York at Buffalo, which sent emails accepting 5,100 applicants who did not, in fact, get in. [NBC News]

2.23 million
Number of new U.S. subscribers to Netflix in the first quarter, which beat analysts’ expectations. Still, the stock was down after news that Netflix’s projection for second-quarter subscriber growth was below that of analysts. [Bloomberg]

$2.9 trillion
Value of assets overseen by hedge fund managers, six times as much as was under their control in 2000. Regulators are eyeing borrowing in the industry, believing it poses risks to the economy as a whole. [The Wall Street Journal]

3 percent
Percentage of California’s 17.2 million registered voters who are members of the super conservative American Independent Party. But, see, that “independent” part seems to be confusing people. A poll of 500 AIP members found 73 percent identified as having no party affiliation. [The Los Angeles Times]

12 refugees
Pope Francis brought 12 Syrian refugees to Vatican City, that country he runs, following a visit to Lesbos, Greece, “a waypoint for hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping violence across the Middle East.” The three Muslim families will now be in the care of the Vatican. [National Catholic Reporter]

70 years
President Raul Castro, who is 84, thinks Cuba’s government is too old and future party officials should retire at age 70 to make room for younger people. The new age limits — following a referendum approving the reforms — would be introduced by 2021, and, in addition to the forcing-out-to-pasture part, 60 would become the top age allowed to get on the party’s central committee. [Reuters]

828+ meters
Minimum height of a new tower planned for Dubai by Emaar Properties PJSC. The new skyscraper would be “a notch taller” than the current tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which stands at 828 meters. Emaar Properties PJSC wants to have this undertaking finished by 2020. [Bloomberg]

Donor 9623
Donor 9623, whose sperm helped create at least 36 children, is not a model donor with an IQ of 160 on a Ph.D. track, as Xytex, a sperm bank based in Georgia, described him. He lied on his application and is, in fact, a college dropout “who has been diagnosed with bipolar and narcissistic personality disorders and schizophrenia and has spent time in prison for burglary.” [KTLA]

43,066th schedule
The NFL released its schedule Friday, the 43,066th one generated by the league’s schedule-making computers after 13 weeks of churning. The team behind the schedule tries to optimize for all sorts of various requests and demands, including stadium sharing, desired home openers, teams that want to have a bye after a London game and concerts.

4 movies
Director James Cameron announced that he will make four sequels to his 2009 film “Avatar,” aka Pocahontas in space, instead of two. It’s unclear what Cameron believes he failed to say with “Avatar” that requires four additional films, but we’ll see when the sequels come out in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023. [Variety]

7th-largest
If “The Walking Dead,” a comic published by Image Comics, were its own comic book company, it would be the seventh-largest production house by market share. The comic book and the television series it spawned are juggernauts; as a result, Image Comics and AMC, the network that airs the TV adaptation, have earned enough money and prestige to each undergo a creative renaissance. [FiveThirtyEight]

11 losses
In the eight GOP and 10 Democratic conventions since the Civil War that required more than one ballot to select a presidential nominee, the leader on the first ballot lost the nomination 11 times. That historical precedent is not great for Donald Trump, who could face a contested Republican convention in Cleveland, but when has that guy ever given a hoot about historical precedent? [Pew Research Center]

20 percent
How much the price of televisions sold online fell in February compared to a year earlier, according to a new price index from Adobe. The Consumer Price Index, which looks at television prices across the whole market, saw a 15 percent drop over the same period. [The New York Times]

51 cars
Czech police say that an officer driving drunk crashed his Jeep into 51 parked cars Tuesday. This is honestly pretty impressive and a general credit to the durability and sturdiness of both the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Czech liver. [Associated Press]

$175,000
Remember that time a University of California, Davis, cop blasted pepper spray into the eyes of a bunch of college students at point-blank range? UC Davis would rather you didn’t. The university has paid upwards of $175,000 to consultants to scrub the image from the internet. You know, this image of a UC Davis officer pepper spraying college students. [Sacramento Bee]

2 years
How long Taco Bell spent researching the best cheese-melting technique to ensure that tearing open a Quesalupa leaves the two taco halves connected by a cheesy string. Complaining about your Quesalupa’s cheesiness on social media is met with strict corporate justice. Taco Bell HQ will call an offending location to remind them of the proper technique: Fry the shell for 90 seconds and serve it within 15 minutes, otherwise the cheese will get hard. [Bloomberg]

6 inches
Three months ago, Inky, an octopus being detained at a holding facility in New Zealand calling itself the National Aquarium, mounted a daring escape to freedom that involved breaking free of his enclosure, dragging his body along the floor, and exiting to the ocean through a six-inch drain. The details of how the prisoner of conscience — who was held without trial for two years on evidence of his affiliation with the cephalopod sect of the Mollusca phylum — escaped are only now coming to light. Worth noting is that octopi are vastly intelligent and capable of memory, and I can only assume that Inky is radicalizing his brothers-in-multiple-arms for the coming war. [The Washington Post]

10 days
Theranos Inc., a beleaguered startup in the blood-testing market, is in hot water with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Regulators found major issues at the company’s laboratory in California and last month gave Theranos 10 days to produce evidence demonstrating why the Feds shouldn’t revoke its lab license and ban founder Elizabeth Holmes from the business for two years. [The Wall Street Journal]

73 wins
The Golden State Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 125-104 Wednesday night, becoming the first team in NBA history to get 73 wins in a regular season. [ESPN]

720 days
Ethan Couch, who killed four people driving drunk when he was a minor and received 10 years probation following a controversial “affluenza” defense, has been sentenced as an adult to nearly two years in jail after violating his probation, 180 days for each of the four deaths. [NPR]

The White House will redirect $589 million — predominantly from funds allocated to fight Ebola — toward fighting the Zika virus, with additional funding requested from Congress. [Reuters]
