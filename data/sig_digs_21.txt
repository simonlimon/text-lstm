This Sunday is the Super Bowl. Here’s an unbiased and fundamentally neutral rundown. 

0.52
Since 2001 the New England Patriots have run 0.52 quarterback sneaks on average each game, about one every other week, making them the sneakiest team in the league. While some may construe this as a solid strategy that extends a drive, others like me see it for what it is: even more evidence of the fundamental perfidy of the New England Patriots organization. [FiveThirtyEight]

25 percent
Percentage of Americans who believe that God plays a role in the outcome of sporting events. Moreover, about half of all Americans think that the Almighty rewards athletes who believe and have faith. I hear this, but only because a Pats win this Sunday would all but guarantee the existence and work of Satan on earth for me, you know? [PRRI]

26 extra catches
The Atlanta Falcons will rely on star receiver Julio Jones to confront the Patriots in the Super Bowl. His 66 percent catch rate is higher than the 60 percent rate we’d expect based on the length of his average target, and we calculate that this difference has amounted to 26 “extra” catches over the past three seasons.

29.7 percent
Drop in called penalties between the NFL regular season and the playoffs this year. However, defensive holding — the kind of thing that can stop a stunning athlete like Julio Jones from completing catches if it goes uncalled — has remained constant, at about 1.2 per game. [ESPN]

37,701
Career passing yards for Atlanta’s Matt Ryan, who’s entering his first Super Bowl with the most yards for a first-time Super Bowl QB in the modern NFL era. [ESPN]

$1.38 billion
Value of counterfeit goods seized by the government last year. Operation Team Player is the law enforcement mission trying to cut down on fake sports swag, including Super Bowl gear. That said, you can take my knock-off “18-1” shirt commemorating the New England Patriots’ 2007 loss to the New York Giants from my cold, dead hands, copper. [Bloomberg]

Good luck to both teams! It’s a shame national treasure Rob Gronkowski will not be playing, but it should be a fun game.

Percentage of Americans who think it’s very important to be a Christian in order to be “truly American.” Coincidentally, that’s also probably the percentage of Americans who never realized there were words written on the base of the Statue of Liberty. [FiveThirtyEight]

Amount of cocaine found in the nose cone of an American Airlines jet that arrived from Colombia, or, as we who cover the entertainment business call it, “about 50 Oscar votes’ worth.” [Reuters]

Implied probability according to oddsmaker Paddy Power that Casey Affleck will win the Academy Award for best actor, a 19-point dip since Sunday, when the Screen Actors Guild tapped competitor Denzel Washington for its male lead acting prize. [FiveThirtyEight]

Number of people signed up for health care coverage through the federal insurance marketplace across 39 states as of Jan. 14. That’s about 100,000 more than at the same time last year. [The New York Times]

$630 million
Between a 163-million-pound fine from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority and a $425 million fine from the New York Department of Financial Services, Deutsche Bank owes about $630 million for failing to prevent $10 billion worth of Russian money laundering. [The Guardian]

2 draft picks
MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that the St. Louis Cardinals would be fined $2 million and have their top two draft picks sent to the Houston Astros after an investigation found that former Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa illegally tapped into the Astros database. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

2 regulations
President Trump signed an executive order Monday that would require two federal regulations to be rescinded for every new federal regulation implemented. This is fantastic news, as I have been a long-standing proponent of the idea that the government that governs best is the government that governs like it was cursed by a woods witch after getting caught in her garden in a German folktale. [POLITICO]

3 states
Gregg Phillips — a self-proclaimed voter fraud authority who has said without any evidence that there was illegal voting this past election and who has enjoyed the ear of the president in such matters, namely a campaign against people registered to vote in more than one state — was found to be registered to vote in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi. That doesn’t mean he — or anyone, really — votes in more than one state. It just means that sometimes people decide to go to another state to live their lives. Shocking, I know. [The Associated Press]

12th incarnation of Doctor Who
Peter Capaldi will step down from his role as The Doctor — the 12th incarnation of the iconic U.K. science-fiction character — after the 2017 Christmas special. And, look, I’m just aware enough of this science fictional canon to be pretty ticked off about Capaldi calling it quits after a mere three seasons. We’re talking about an entity that can regenerate just 13 times, and Capaldi is playing the penultimate one. (This is how they recast a character that has been around for actual generations.) Unless they contract a contemporary of Prince George of Cambridge’s for the part, this show will run out of gasoline by the mid-2020s. [The Hollywood Reporter]

12,828
Average attendance at the NHL’s New York Islanders games, the third-worst in an NHL that includes multiple teams in the American South. Brooklyn’s Barclays Center has decided it is no longer worth it to be the home of the Islanders. Good news for me: The team may kick the tires on moving to Queens, according to Bloomberg. [Bloomberg]

Nearly 2.3 million members
Number of members of the Boy Scouts of America ages 7 to 21. On Monday the group announced that it would accept new members based on the gender they list on their application, the latest advance of LGBT rights within the group. Once again, while the Boy Scouts made social progress, they were beat to the punch by the Girl Scouts by several years. [The New York Times]

15 states
President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday that established a 90-day ban on citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country, a 120-day ban on accepting refugees, and an indefinite ban on entry for Syrian refugees. The order was met with chaos, and by Sunday the attorneys general from 15 states and Washington, D.C., had announced opposition to the ban. [Reuters]

8 days
We’ll want to wait and see if the numbers hold, but Trump’s approval rating, according to Gallup, has gone negative for the first time in his presidency, with 45 percent approving of the job he is doing as president and 48 percent disapproving. Incoming presidents typically have a grace period of a year or more before their numbers slip to majority disapproval. [Los Angeles Times]

10,000
The reaction to Friday’s executive order from some in the private sector was swift: Howard Schultz, the chairman and CEO of Starbucks, committed to hiring 10,000 refugees over the next five years, and Google set up a $2 million “crisis fund” with up to a $2 million employee match to benefit the American Civil Liberties Union, the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations’ refugee agency. [USA Today, Starbucks]

$24,164,691
While public officials were sorting out their reactions to the executive order, the ACLU sent attorneys to people who were being detained in U.S. airports as a result. The ACLU said it raised more than $24 million in online donations over the weekend, compared with its annual average of about $3 million to $4 million. [Dustin Volz, ACLU]

Other things also happened this weekend! Randy Orton won his second WWE Royal Rumble, defeating Roman Reigns to win the event. He then pointed at a big sign that said “Wrestlemania,” which leads me to believe that it’s coming up soon and that he intends to attend. (I am new to this. Sorry. A lot of things went down this weekend, and I couldn’t get around to most of them.) Denzel won at the Screen Actors Guild! So did the “Stranger Things” cast. There was also a Pro Bowl game, I think.

6 minutes 56 seconds
In the interest of diversifying the type of content you read in Significant Digits, here are some numbers about Sunday’s WWE Royal Rumble. Chris Jericho is a mere 110 seconds away from joining Triple H as the only other member of the four-hour club, hallowed ground for wrestlers who over the course of their career have spent more than four hours in Royal Rumble matches prior to elimination. Unless Triple H participates, Jericho must last only 6 minutes, 56 seconds — well under his historical average 26 minutes, 28 seconds active in his first nine Royal Rumbles — to obtain the first-place overall record. [The Wrestling Blog, via @StarOfSavage]

49 percent
Percentage of the U.S. public who believes there are no circumstances where the use of torture is acceptable. Donald Trump has recently said he thinks waterboarding works, but will defer to his Secretary of Defense about whether to use it. [Pew Research Center]

60 percent
Percentage of primate species that are threatened with extinction across the globe. Three quarters of the species have declining populations. We’re pretty much the exception here, folks. [EarthSky]

80 infections
There’s a mumps outbreak in Spokane, Washington that has led officials to tell 300 students without current vaccinations to stay home. Health officials said that the outbreak would be worse without the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination; the vaccine is about 88 percent effective overall. [ABC News]

$2 billion
Amount of money U.S. residents send to family in Mexico monthly, a figure that collectively accounts for some 3 percent of their economy. Regardless of the specifics, President Trump’s policies regarding our southern neighbor could cause substantial changes to their economy. [FiveThirtyEight]

$1.7 trillion
Estimated total contribution to the U.S. economy from LGBT-owned businesses, according to a report from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. That’s based on an extrapolation from a group of more than 900 certified businesses contributing $1.15 billion as a whole. [Associations Now]

58 tournaments
Japan has had a drought of yokozuna, or sumo wrestling grand champions, in this century. For dozens of tournaments between 2006 and 2016, Japan didn’t have a tournament winner in part because of strong performances from Mongolian competitors. That ended this month when Kisenosato won a tournament and was promoted to the rank of yokozuna. [FiveThirtyEight]

93.5
Average Metacritic score of the ten highest-scoring films of 2016. Looking back at that top tier, last year was a very good year indeed — over the past 12 years, only 2013’s best movies were more highly rated. [The Black List]

216 percent of normal
Since October 1, downtown Los Angeles has recorded upwards of 13 inches of rain, a level that’s 216 percent what the city normally gets in that period and a respite from its searing drought. [The Los Angeles Times]

20,000
Yesterday a vestigial and arbitrary collection of stocks hit a number that American stock traders — mainly the kind made of flesh and not the kind made out of silicon and code — found to be aesthetically or psychologically pleasing. Congratulations to the Dow Jones Industrial Average for hitting 20,000. [The Wall Street Journal]

17.3 billion
Number of times Americans wrote out a check in 2015. Compare that number to the 69.5 billion debit card purchases in the same year. I’m pretty sure my checks still have my college living address on them, and every one of them has gone to a landlord. [The Wall Street Journal]

$559 billion
Forecasted U.S. budget deficit in fiscal year 2017, down from $587 billion in F.Y. 2016. [Reuters]

Today we’re taking a short break from your regularly scheduled roasting of the New England Patriots to talk about the Oscars nominations that were announced yesterday. I am the culture writer around these parts, and the Oscars are my jam, so today it’s an all-Oscars SigDig.

1
Amazon’s “Manchester by the Sea” became the first-ever film produced by a digital streaming service to be nominated for best picture. Netflix has had some success attracting awards attention, but primarily in the documentary category. [The Hollywood Reporter]

6 films
Yesterday a total of nine films were nominated for best picture: “La La Land,” “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Fences,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Arrival,” “Lion,” “Hell or High Water” and “Hidden Figures.” Director Martin Scorsese probably isn’t thrilled: bookmakers gave his film “Silence” better odds of winning best picture than the latter six of those nominated films. [FiveThirtyEight]

14 nominations
“La La Land” has tied the record for total Oscar nominations set by “All About Eve” and “Titanic,” hauling in a total of 14. When it comes to lifetime acting Oscar nominations, Meryl Streep extended her record with a 20th nomination, for “Florence Foster Jenkins.” [ABC News, The AV Club]

35 percent
Percentage of this year’s acting nominees who are people of color, a welcome departure from recent years that failed to recognize diverse talent. [Variety]

84 percent
That’s the percentage of time that the winner of the Directors Guild award for best feature film direction went on to win the Academy Award for best director over the past 25 years. We use stats like that — the historical accuracy of guild and critic awards — to build our annual Oscar tracking model, which we launched yesterday. Check it out. [FiveThirtyEight]

467 minutes
“O.J.: Made In America” is 7 hours 47 minutes long, and it is now the longest film ever nominated for an Oscar. (It’s nominated for best documentary.) Full disclosure, FiveThirtyEight is owned by ESPN, which made that movie. [Variety]

3:40 a.m.
A 25-year-old Patriots fan drunkenly pulled the fire alarm at the Logan Airport Hilton at 3:40 a.m. Sunday. The Pats’ opponents later that day — the Pittsburgh Steelers — were staying at the Hilton that evening. The fan, Dennis Harrison, has been charged with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. It should not be difficult to assemble a jury of his peers, in my estimation, because how hard can it be to find 12 drunk Patriots fans in the vicinity of Logan airport? [The Los Angles Times]

45 percent
President Trump currently has a 45 percent job approval rating after three days in the presidency according to the Gallup tracker. All presidents since the beginning of the Gallup tracker have had a net approval rating 32 points or higher, with the exception of President Trump, who has a net approval rating of 0. The same percentage of respondents approve of the job he is doing as the percentage who disapprove. [FiveThirtyEight]

Approximate number of geese killed by toxic waste emanating from a former copper mine in Montana this past weekend. Regardless of how you feel about geese, toxic waste or copper mines, this should prove an instructive moment for how the Trump Environmental Protection Agency will handle the Superfund site. [The Guardian]

37 million
A report from the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Rights found that should Roe v. Wade be overturned, more than 37 million women in 33 states could live in an area where abortion was illegal. [The Cut]

$250 million
Price of the home at 944 Bel Air Road, and reportedly the most expensive house in America. The 12-bedroom, 21-bathroom home boasts great views of Los Angeles so you can yearn Gatsby-like for that better Old Money lifestyle in the distance, and naturally has five bars inside to deal with all the problems that money causes. [The Guardian]

$37 billion
Aetna’s $37 billion bid to purchase rival insurer Humana was blocked by a judge because of antitrust concerns. If you’re one of the folks waiting for the $48 billion Anthem and Cigna merger to be approved, you’re probably sweating right about now. [Bloomberg]

4 justices
Back in September, eight of nine Texas Supreme Court justices voted to reject a case related to same-sex marriage rights in the Lone Star State. After a campaign led by the state’s top Republicans, at least four of those justices voted Friday to reinstate the case, with oral arguments set for March 1. Opponents of gay marriage in Texas see a chance to strip government employees of what attorney Jonathan Saenz called “illegal same-sex benefits.” Those against re-litigating same-sex marriage claimed the court may have been encouraged by the election of President Trump. [The Austin American-Statesman]

Fall in global production of farmed salmon in 2016 by volume, thanks to a monstrosity called the sea louse. It’s a miserable parasite that ravages farmed salmon populations, and now salmon prices are bound to rise. [Quartz]

Awesome news! We’re running out of sports to create interactive models for now that we’ve launched FiveThirtyEight’s club soccer index. As it stands, Chelsea has a 68 percent chance of winning the Premier League, Barcelona has a 52 percent chance to win La Liga, Bayern Munich has a 90 percent shot of winning Bundesliga, Juventus has a 63 percent chance of winning Serie A, and Monaco has a 49 percent chance of winning Ligue 1. Barcelona has a 26 percent shot of winning the Champions League. [FiveThirtyEight]

61 percent
The Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl after each team won its conference championship game Sunday. FiveThirtyEight’s Elo analysis says the Patriots have a 61 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl, and according to my analysis there is a 39 percent chance of a positive end to the NFL season. [FiveThirtyEight]

38,000 pounds
A truck lost its trailer transporting some 38,000 pounds of marbles in Indianapolis Saturday morning, causing substantial traffic problems and low-hanging jokes. [Fox 40]

470,000 people
Crowd scientists estimate that at least 470,000 people attended the Women’s March in Washington. D.C. Metro ridership was measured at 1,001,613 entries, the second-biggest daily volume in the history of the D.C. Metro, after only President Obama’s 2009 inauguration day, which saw about 1.1 million entries. [The Washington Post, The New York Times]
